Once you have made your selection, you are then required to prepare an analysis of that topic.</p>\n<p>Choose only <strong>ONE </strong>of the following two topics:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Fertilisers, nutrients, and the role of soil nutrient budgeting</strong>. There is increasing pressure on soils, not only because we need to produce more food for a growing human population, but also because of competing uses of soils, such as for the production of biofuels.</p>\n<p>a. What is a soil nutrient budget and why is it important? AND</p>\n<p>b. Giving specific consideration to the nutrient budgets reported for Australia, what are the implications (from both the perspective of the soil and the broader health of the environment and planet) for a positive budget and a negative budget? AND</p>\n<p>c. What changes in management can be made where budgets are positive or negative?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Global nitrogen cycle</strong>. Nitrogen fertilisers are the most commonly applied fertiliser globally. Although our production of food is heavily reliant on these nitrogen fertilisers, the application (and over-application) of these fertilisers causes substantial environmental harm. Give consideration to:</p>\n<p>a. How reliant our agricultural systems (and hence the human population) are on nitrogen fertilisers, AND</p>\n<p>b. The adverse environmental effects caused by the application (and over-application) of nitrogen fertilisers to soil, including the approaches whereby these adverse impacts could be reduced or avoided in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the soil-system (ensure your focus remains on soil-based approaches).</p>\n<p>Begin by reading all relevant material thoroughly. As you read, make notes of the important ideas and concepts. When writing the analysis, consider the following suggested structure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction. Describe the overall topic, and summarise your main points that you will then expand in later sections.</li>\n<li>Main text (this could be split into different sections). Describe in detail your main information by assessing, reviewing, and summarising the relevant information. Support your evaluation with detailed evidence from the literature. Do not forget to include appropriate references.</li>\n<li>Summary. Finish with a summary and an evaluation of your main conclusions.</li>\n<li>References. Do not cite your Course notes (for example, LAND2003 or LAND3005). Rather, you must only cite articles and books from the scientific literature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Length: 2000 words +/- 10% (excluding references and any appendices)</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
