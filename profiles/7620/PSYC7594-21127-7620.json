This should be submitted to the course tutor before the class and it will be projected to the class along with other students’ presentations for one-minute, during which time you should outline its key features. This will also allow you to practice developing and presenting this specific type of high-impact presentation to organisational decision makers. A couple of examples will provided in the first class, but these should not be taken as definitive models of how to do this exercise. Models of infographic design (and free samples of programmes to help create these) can be found on the internet (e.g., at canva.com).</p>\n<p>Time allowed: 4 minutes</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
