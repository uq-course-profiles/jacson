You are, therefore, required to actively participate in and contribute to all class, group and online learning activities. Participation is assessed in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <strong>attendance</strong> at and <strong>contribution</strong> to the workshops will be recorded (Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11), while your participation in Weeks 7 and 9 will be covered in the marking of Assessment 2 (group project). </li>\n<li>In the weeks when each of the seven modules is wrapped up (Weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11), you will complete a <strong>written reflection in class</strong>. At the end of the workshop, you will be asked to reflect on and describe (1) a major insight that you gained from the module, and (2) how this insight can be applied in the context of your own (professional and/or personal) realities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
