Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<h3>Research Approach</h3>\n<p>Your thesis may be empirical or theoretical. However, bear in mind that theoretical research is often more challenging.</p>\n<p>A strong thesis should exhibit a clear thematic structure. The introduction must clearly outline the research objectives and the techniques employed. It may also be beneficial to include a brief literature review on directly relevant topics. Arguments should be presented systematically in a logical and coherent manner. Each chapter should begin with an explanation of its role within the thesis to guide the reader effectively. The progression of the thesis should be structured to lead as directly as possible to a logical conclusion.</p>\n<p>Assessment will be based not only on the discussion and conclusions but also on the research process, the strength of the argument, and the overall presentation quality.</p>\n<h3>Thesis Structure</h3>\n<p>Every thesis must include the following components in addition to the main research exposition:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Includes background information, research objectives, significance of the study, research questions and/or hypotheses, and an outline of the thesis structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong>: Discusses the relevant economic theories underpinning the research. If no established economic theory applies, this section should justify why economic expertise is necessary and relevant.</li>\n<li><strong>Literature Review</strong>: Critically examines recent economic and related literature. This section should be more focused than a broader literature outline in the Introduction.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Analysis (for an empirical thesis)</strong>: Describes data sources, potential limitations, and the analytical techniques employed.</li>\n<li><strong>OR Theoretical Analysis (for a theoretical thesis)</strong>: Describes the theoretical model, analysis, and proofs.</li>\n<li><strong>Results</strong>: Presents findings from the analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>Discussion and Conclusion</strong>: Analyzes the implications and limitations of the research. The conclusion should not merely summarize previous chapters but should include policy recommendations (if applicable) and suggestions for future research.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Language and Writing Standards</h3>\n<p>A high standard of English is expected. You are encouraged to consult academic writing resources. Your supervisor can offer guidance but will not correct poor writing. Students who wish to seek help on language and writing skills are strongly encouraged to consult UQ Student Services <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/study-skills-and-learning-advice/study-skills-and-learning-advice-overview/first-steps-research\">First Steps in Research</a> (for thesis writing) or <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/study-skills-and-learning-advice/study-skills-and-learning-advice-overview/assignment-writing\">Assignment Writing</a> (for academic writing skills).</p>\n<h3>Draft Submission</h3>\n<p>You should submit a draft to your advisor at least two weeks before the due date to receive feedback. It is advisable to submit individual chapters progressively throughout the semester. Last-minute submissions often result in avoidable errors and may impact grading.</p>\n<h3>Length</h3>\n<p>The thesis should be <strong>15,000 to 20,000 words</strong>, including footnotes but excluding tables, figures, and references.</p>\n<h3>Formatting Guidelines</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paper Size</strong>: A4 (297 x 210 mm)</li>\n<li><strong>Font</strong>: Preferably 12-point (minimum 11-point for body text; smaller fonts acceptable in tables/figures)</li>\n<li><strong>Line Spacing</strong>: Double spacing (1.5 spacing is allowed)</li>\n<li><strong>Margins</strong>: Left: 3cm; Right: 2cm; Top and Bottom: 2cm</li>\n<li><strong>Pagination</strong>: Consecutive page numbering</li>\n<li><strong>Submission</strong>: Electronic submission via Turnitin on Blackboard (no hard copies required)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Required Thesis Sections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Title Page</strong></li>\n<li>The University of Queensland</li>\n<li>Faculty of Business, Economics and Law</li>\n<li>School of Economics</li>\n<li>Thesis title (in full)</li>\n<li>Course name and degree program</li>\n<li>Student's name and previous degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Declaration Statement</strong> <em>(Signed copy required)</em></li>\n<li>Confrims originality of work and specifies thesis length</li>\n<li><strong>Abstract</strong> <em>(Max: 200 words)</em></li>\n<li>Outlines the research aims, scope, conclusions, and key terms (up to six)</li>\n<li><strong>Table of Contents</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lists of Figures, Tables, Illustrations, and Diagrams</strong> (as appropriate)</li>\n<li><strong>Acronyms and Abbreviations</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Main Thesis Chapters</strong></li>\n<li><strong>References</strong> <em>(APA 7th style)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Appendices</strong> (if applicable)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Referencing Style</h3>\n<p>APA 7th (see <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">UQ Library's guide</a>)</p>\n<h3>Footnotes, Tables, and Figures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Footnotes should be used sparingly and are included in the word count.</li>\n<li>Tables, figures, and references are excluded from the word count.</li>\n<li>Large tables should be placed in an appendix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>\n<p>Academic integrity and appropriate conduct is non-negotiable. Unacceptable behaviours include, but are not limited to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plagiarism;</li>\n<li>Fabrication of references or evidence;</li>\n<li>Failure to reference Artificial Intelligence (AI) use; and</li>\n<li>Soliciting or aiding and abetting contract cheating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Academic misconduct will be handled in accordance with <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=149\">UQ Student Integrity and Misconduct Policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Accidental plagiarism is still considered plagiarism and will be handled as an academic misconduct. See <a href=\"https://uq.pressbooks.pub/digital-essentials-write-cite-submit/chapter/plagiarism/\">UQ Library's Guide on Plagiarism</a> if you are unsure what requires referencing.</p>\n<h3>Referencing and Acknowledging AI or MT use</h3>\n<p>Reference AI and MT use using APA 7th style in the references of your written proposal. AI use should then be acknowledged using a table like the <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/tools-and-techniques/ai-student-hub/acknowledge-and-reference-ai-use\">Example Cover Sheet provided by UQ Library</a> (expand \"Example Cover Sheet\" under \"How to acknowledge your use of AI in assessment\"). The table should be inserted after the references.</p>\n<h3>Using Previous Research</h3>\n<p>If your thesis builds upon your ECON7950 Research Proposal, you must clearly reference specific sections rather than copying large portions of text. Citation format:</p>\n<p><em>(Your surname, year, p. ?)</em> e.g., <em>(Anthony, 2018, p. 3)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Example reference entry:</strong> Anthony, J. (2019). <em>Food security in India: Achievements and challenges.</em> Research proposal submitted for ECON7950 (Research Methods in Economics).</p>\n<h3>Submission and Assessment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Only electronic submissions via Turnitin on Blackboard are accepted.</li>\n<li>The marking criteria can be accessed via Learn.UQ or mySI-net.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
