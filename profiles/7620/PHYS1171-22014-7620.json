If you are unable to attend, please email PHYS1171@uq.edu.au to explain your circumstances, including an explanation of why you cannot attend another session. You will need to do this within 5 calendar days of your original practical class and include appropriate evidence (e.g., medical certificate). If approved, you will be given an exemption from that assessment, and your remaining marks will be reweighted. For example, with one exemption your mark will be taken from the 4 assessments completed of the 5 practicals. You can receive at most two exemptions during semester.</p>",
