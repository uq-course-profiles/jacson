This assessment is also intended to provide timely feedback on the research proposal, to ensure the supervisor(s) and student agree on the research plan and timeline. The review consists of two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>(1)</strong>   <strong>Project proposal</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Students must submit a written proposal to their supervisor(s) before the meeting. This written proposal is not graded; therefore it can be in any format, any length, and can be a draft (discuss with research supervisors on their expectations). Writing the proposal is a way to get students prepared for the review meeting. The written proposal can also form part of the final report.</p>\n<p>As a guide (i.e. not a requirment), the proposal should be under 2,000 words (excluding references) and include:</p>\n<p>a.     the background to the intended research;</p>\n<p>b.     the research question, aims and objectives;</p>\n<p>c.     the research methods;</p>\n<p>d.     the expected outcomes;</p>\n<p>e.     the significance of the research and its contribution to new knowledge;</p>\n<p>f.       the timeline of the research</p>\n<p><strong>(2)   Review meeting held between weeks 4 and 6</strong></p>\n<p>The meeting should include:</p>\n<p>a.     Student’s introduction and a presentation of their progress to date (suggested length: 5-10mins)</p>\n<p>b.     A Q&amp;A session for supervisor(s) to assess the student’s understanding of the topic, e.g. identifying the research gap(s), the appropriateness and limitations of methods, explaining the significance of the research, and outlining the next steps</p>\n<p>c.     Feedback from the supervisor(s) on the proposal and discussion of any concerns</p>\n<p>The supervisor(s) will mark the student’s performance in the review meeting, based on their understanding of the project. <strong>The review meeting must be recorded, and a link of the recording should be submitted to Blackboard as proof of assessment completion. </strong>The meeting may be held online or in person<strong> </strong>(an in-person meeting can be recorded using a webcam/phone).<strong> </strong>The supervisor(s) may require the student to amend the proposal following the review.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for organising the review meeting, recording the meeting, and completing a short form on Blackboard following the meeting. Students should start planning for the review early in the course, e.g. discuss with the supervisor on the meeting timing and their expectations.</p>\n<p>Submission guide: Students are to complete a short form on Blackboard following the meeting. The form includes a link (URL) to the recorded meeting. This should be completed and submitted by the due date. Late penalties apply.</p>\n<p>(As per UQ policy, the recording must be retained for at least one year after the release of final grades for potential re-marking).</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
