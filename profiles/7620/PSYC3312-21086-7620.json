Each lecture has readings associated with it, and you will be required to keep up with these readings on a weekly basis. After each lecture you will be given a 5-item multiple-choice quiz which will assess your knowledge of the lecture content and the required readings for that week. You need to complete the quizzes online via the Blackboard site by the due date, i.e. midday the day after each lecture. Each multiple choice item will have four options, with only one correct option, and you will receive a mark out of 5 for each of the quizzes. Marks from best 11 of 13 quizzes will be used in calculating your total score. Scores from 11/13 quizzes will be summed and weighted for a score out of 40. You will have 10 minutes to complete each quiz and you will only be able to take each quiz once. You will see each question once and will not be able to go back to questions presented earlier within each quiz. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Media representations of parenting and child development may shape public perceptions far more rapidly than academic research can. </p>\n<p>In this assessment (max. 1000 words), you will write an essay where you critically analyse an online media article relating to parenting, family relationships, and child development. This task requires you to examine how the article represents psychological research and family issues, and to consider the potential consequences of this representation for parents, families, and broader public discourse. You will also evaluate the accuracy, quality, and implications of the media piece by comparing it with current theoretical frameworks and empirical research.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Tasks</strong></p>\n<p>·        Identify the parenting and family psychology concepts used (or misused) in the article.</p>\n<p>·        Assess the accuracy of the article’s portrayal of evidence about families or child development.</p>\n<p>·        Critically analyse how such representations may influence parents’ emotions, decision-making, stress, relationships, and/or help-seeking behaviour.</p>\n<p>·        Reflect on broader implications for family wellbeing, parent–child relationships, and public understanding of parenting.</p>\n<p>·        Construct a clear, evidence-based academic argument.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Essay Components </strong></p>\n<p>Summary of the article which describes: (i) what the article claims about a parenting or family issue; (ii) the tone (e.g., alarmist, reassuring, moralising), and; (iii) the implied message about what parents should think or do.</p>\n<p>Identification of central parenting and family concepts noted in the article such as parenting styles and practices, attachment theory, family systems theory, co-parenting dynamics, parental stress, guilt, or mental load, child behavioural development, risk/protection factors within families, social norms around “ideal parenting”. Be sure to explain each concept accurately with appropriate referencing and link it directly to how it appears (explicitly or implicitly) in the media article.</p>\n<p>Critical evaluation of evidence which compares the article’s claims with empirical research. In this section you need to examine what the empirical evidence is for key claims made and how this evidence is reflected (or not) in the article. Consider questions such as: Are findings overstated? Is research misrepresented or cherry-picked? Does the article apply findings inappropriately across contexts (e.g., one study → universal parenting advice)? Does it promote unrealistic expectations about parenting or child behaviour? What nuance or complexity is missing?</p>\n<p>Real-world implications for parents and families discussing how such media representations may influence factors such as parental stress, guilt, or confidence; parenting behaviour or decision-making; parent–child relationships; co-parenting conflict; family wellbeing; public stigma or judgement toward certain parenting practices; vulnerability to misinformation or pseudoscience; help-seeking (or avoidance).</p>\n<p>The required referencing style is that of the American Psychological Association (APA). Remember to write the paper as an essay with a clear introduction, middle and conclusion. It is not a good idea to simply address the \"questions\" in the assignment guidelines in order - i.e., avoid simply addressing the points without imposing any other structure. It is usually a good idea to keep your introduction and conclusion brief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assignments must be substantially your own work. If you wish to report another author's point of view you should do so in your own words, and properly referenced in accordance with APA style. Direct quotations should be used sparingly, form a small part of your work, and must be placed in quotation marks and referenced. Any material taken from texts and other references, including electronic resources, and the Internet or AI, must be acknowledged.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All assignments must be submitted via the Blackboard website for this course.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In particular, you need to: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a)      Describe the strategy: What is it that the parent does when using this strategy? What factors (e.g., timing, intensity, frequency) make this strategy more or less effective? </p>\n<p>b)     Discuss the rationale: Why is this strategy important for child development and/or why do parents choose to use this strategy?</p>\n<p>c)      Examine the evidence: What is the empirical evidence supporting or contradicting the use of this strategy? What are the strengths and limitations of this strategy?   </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Select only ONE of the following parenting strategies for your presentation</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>   Affection</p>\n<p> Attending to positive behaviour</p>\n<p> Incidental teaching</p>\n<p>   Clear, calm instructions</p>\n<p> Logical consequences</p>\n<p> Backward chaining</p>\n<p>   Diversion </p>\n<p> Planned ignoring </p>\n<p> Quiet time</p>\n<p>   Praise</p>\n<p> Modelling </p>\n<p> Directed discussion</p>\n<p>   Quality time</p>\n<p> Engaging activities</p>\n<p> Behaviour/star charts</p>\n<p>   Talking to children </p>\n<p> Forward chaining (ask, say, do)</p>\n<p> House rules</p>\n<p>   Time out</p>\n<p> Activity schedules</p>\n<p> Smacking </p>\n<p>    </p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>Each student in a tutorial must present information about a different parenting strategy. During tutorials in Week 4, you will be allocated a tutorial presentation time and will confirm your selected topic with your tutor. We will randomly allocate topics to each student in the tutorial.</p>\n<p>The task is to present your findings during your allocated tutorial. Try to make your presentation as interesting as possible. You will have a maximum of 20 minutes to complete your presentation. </p>\n<p><strong>Each student </strong>needs to submit a copy of the presentation slides via the Blackboard site by the due date (and please note that this is not necessarily the same, as the day you will present). You <strong>cannot</strong> make any changes to your slides following submission. You must use the slides that you submitted during your presentation. </p>\n<p><strong>Part 2:  </strong></p>\n<p>During each student presentation (other than your own) complete a short summary and feedback of the presentation. The short summary will consist of identifying 3 key things that you have learned about the presented strategy. The feedback will involve providing constructive feedback in which you note at least one thing that the student did well and one area for improvement. This part of the assessment will be completed for each presentation at each tutorial on a paper form provided to you by your tutor. You will submit these completed forms to your tutor at the end of each tutorial. These will be marked as pass/fail and will constitute 5% of the final mark for Assessment 3, with 80% of forms needed to be completed in order to gain this mark.</p>\n<p>Please make sure that you do not just read your presentation. The presentation is marked by the tutor during the tutorial. Feedback on the presentation and marks will be allocated once all presentations have been completed.   </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
