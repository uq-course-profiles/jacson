In addition to the written thesis, students are required to participate in a pass/fail oral defence hurdle about the thesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Word count</strong> <strong>exclusions</strong>: text in figures, diagrams, and tables; fore-pages (title page up to the first page of the first or introductory chapter), appendices, and reference list or bibliography.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools</strong>: This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst there may be instances where it is appropriate for students to use AI tools in their thesis project, successful completion of the thesis assessment will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. AI tools (including generative AI and machine translation tools) should be used with caution as they may lead to disputes about copyright, authorship, plagiarism, and research integrity. If you plan to use AI tools in the research or writing of your thesis, you <strong>MUST consult with your Thesis Advisor</strong> and/or Honours Convenor to discuss how you plan to use it, whether this usage is appropriate, how to document this usage, and how to acknowledge AI usage in your submitted assessment. <strong>A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </strong>Guidelines on how to reference AI in your assessment can be found here: <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/ai-tools-assignments\">https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/ai-tools-assignments</a> (additional guidance will be provided on Blackboard). UQ guidelines on AI usage can be found at the <strong>UQ AI Student Hub</strong>: <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/study-and-learning-support/ai-student-hub\">https://web.library.uq.edu.au/study-and-learning-support/ai-student-hub</a> including UQ rules for using AI.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
