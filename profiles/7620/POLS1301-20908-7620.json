A research puzzle is something interesting, perplexing, confusing, and/or important about political ideas to which there is no obvious answer to hand. This might be a puzzle about a concept, a debate, or a thinker. Once you have identified a puzzle, you will then move on the develop a research question to guide your exploration of it. You will work first in groups and then individually with the assistance of your tutor to complete this first part of your task. Your tutor will informally review your work and provide feedback during the tutorial. <strong>Your Research Plan – Part 1</strong> must be submitted via Turnitin on the Blackboard during or immediately after the relevant tutorial. It should consist of (1) one paragraph detailing a research puzzle and (2) a research question.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>second </strong>part of the task, you will develop your puzzle and question into a research plan. The research plan will detail how you intend to answer your question. It should have three components: (1) Information about your general argument, including at least three reasons for making that argument and at least one potential objection; (2) information about the structure of your essay; (3) information about your main sources/readings for the essay. This information can be presented in any form, including bullet points and tables. <strong>Your Research Plan – Final</strong> must be submitted via Turnitin on the Blackboard page by the <strong>Deadline. </strong>In total it should consist of (1) one paragraph detailing a research puzzle, (2) a research question, (3) argument section, (4) structure, (5) sources. In total, <strong>the research plan should be no more than 3 pages in length</strong> (including the question and puzzle from part 1).</p>\n<p>References should be used wherever needed. </p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
