To remain competitive, pubs, cafes, and restaurants must find innovative ways to adapt to changing trends and meet customer needs.</p>\n<p>Emerging trends refer to the changing patterns in consumer behaviour, society, or technology that can potentially transform the future of the food and beverage (F&amp;B) industry. For instance, advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics are helping F&amp;B businesses enhance their efficiency and performance, ultimately creating smarter operations. These trends rapidly gain traction through social media, thanks to sharing and publicity. However, the introduction of robots can lead to communication challenges that might negatively impact the customer experience. Therefore, for any new trend in the F&amp;B industry to be sustainable, it is essential to strike a balance between providing an authentic customer experience, ensuring profitability, promoting community well-being, and supporting environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>Your tasks are divided into two parts. Part One requires you to submit one reflection at the end of each class for weeks 2, 3, and 4. Based on your reflections from Part One, you will select a real-world example to analyse in Part Two in the form of a report. </p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: Reflection piece: Submit in class after each activity </strong></p>\n<p>1. Discuss <strong>ONE</strong> emerging trend and its development</p>\n<p>2. In your reflection elaborate on the factors that influence the rise of this F&amp;B trend</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Your reflection should be <strong>ONE page</strong> <strong>maximum</strong> per submission. As this is a secure assessment piece, if you are unable to attend the scheduled class activities due to a valid reason, then the student must apply for an extension following the university procedures. Once approved, the student may be permitted to submit their work online in consultation with the teaching team.

The F&amp;B provider can range from a restaurant, a café or bar, or executive lounge that offers F&amp;B services.</p>\n<p><strong>Final deliverable:</strong> You are required to write an Evaluation and Design Report to identify the problem(s) of the selected F&amp;B provider and provide relevant recommendations. You should position yourself as a service experience designer, and recommend an updated F&amp;B experience in your design proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Limit</strong>: 3,000 words<strong> </strong>including tables and figures, but excluding references. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Select</strong> one F&amp;B provider (this is not limited to the Greater Brisbane region). You may consider one provider that you can physically visit or have previously visited (but not compulsory).</li>\n<li><strong>Collect</strong> both the first-hand and second-hand data to comprehensively evaluate the F&amp;B experiences. <strong>First-hand data</strong> can include your personal visitation (past/present) of your selected F&amp;B provider, or your on-site observational notes while eating and drinking in this place. <strong>Second-hand data</strong> can include industry reports, blogs, online reviews, video documentaries, media coverage, and other social media posts and comments. (Examples are discussed in class).</li>\n<li><strong>Analyse</strong> the context of the selected F&amp;B provider (i.e., its cultural, social, historical and commercial background), customers’ socio-psychological needs and expectations, and <strong>evaluate</strong> the F&amp;B experiences. You are expected to analyse the first- and second-hand data (e.g., customers’ online review of your selected F&amp;B provider, and personal observational notes). Your evaluation should apply the Five Aspects Meal Model (FAMM), socio-cultural and psychological theories as well as design thinking that we discuss in this course to help frame and guide the analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify and discuss</strong> the problem(s) related to F&amp;B experiences. You are required to critically evaluate its consumer-product relationship, and discuss both the positive and negative aspects of the F&amp;B experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>(Re)design</strong> the F&amp;B experience with justification. This design part should include an overview of your design, a clear link to literature, and the method of delivery. You are strongly encouraged to provide <strong>additional materials</strong> to support the design (such as menus, product information sheets, pictures or graphs available online/personally designed). It is also important to touch upon the practical dimensions of their F&amp;B product, venue (servicescape), menu design, pricing, and hygiene considerations if relevant.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>An example of report sections:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Section Headings</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Title page</strong> - Title of the food and beverage experience design project; student names and id numbers; course code</p>\n<p><strong>Table of contents</strong> - List the sections of the proposal</p>\n<p><strong>Executive summary </strong>- This section summarises the aim and outcomes of the project.

It showcases your efforts to design and develop a food and drink experience to improve consumer-product relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview of your selected F&amp;B provider and project objectives</strong> - Outline the physical context and socio-cultural background of your selected F&amp;B provider. Explain your design purpose and main objectives (e.g., why you have chosen this F&amp;B provider, what you intend to evaluate and what you seek to achieve). Explain the profile of its customers using online/secondary data.</p>\n<p><strong>Data collection and analysis</strong> - Explain the method you used, the procedures of data collection, and your sample and relevant sources. Explain your data analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation of F&amp;B experiences</strong> - Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the F&amp;B experience and its consumer-product relationship. Address the customers’ needs (pains and gains), and identify the key area(s) to improve F&amp;B experience with detailed evidence/data.</p>\n<p><strong>(Re)design of the F&amp;B experiences with justification</strong> - Using examples to explain your comprehensive design of the F&amp;B experiences.
