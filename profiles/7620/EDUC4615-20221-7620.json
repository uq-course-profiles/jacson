This data may be from student, classroom, school and/or systemic levels. For example, you could analyse selected work samples from one student early and later in your professional experience block, or you could consult with one student of interest to inform your identification of learning needs and then again at the end of the placement to identify where learning or development has occurred.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that some of the items collected in Part A should be linked to this task and should be the evidence you use to inform and prepare your critical reflection.</p>\n<p>APST: 3.1-3.5, 4.1-4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
