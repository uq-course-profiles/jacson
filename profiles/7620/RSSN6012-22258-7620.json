It should engage critically with existing research, apply appropriate theoretical and methodological frameworks, and present findings in a manner consistent with academic conventions. The thesis serves as a capstone project, reflecting the student’s research skills, analytical abilities, and understanding of the discipline.</p>\n<p>A word count that is within ±10% of the set length (word limit) is acceptable. Word count does not include footnotes; however, discursive footnotes are included in the word count.
