The presentation should include an analysis of the artwork.

Students should connect the artwork to themes such as history, social issues, ideologies, paradigms.</p>\n<p><strong>2 ORGANISATION</strong>- Use PowerPoint. An important part of the presentation is the interaction with the public. The lecturer and students will be asking questions at the end of each group presentation.
