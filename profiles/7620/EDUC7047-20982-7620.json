You will talk about the language situation in the polity together with policies for education and society. You will be randomly allocated to polities by your tutor. Taking an ecological view, you will describe the various languages and varieties and their current situation in the polity. You will take a historical perspective to explain the evolution of the languages in their current form and status. There are many examples of polity studies in the LPP literature.</p>\n<p>The polity presentation will start from Week 7 (the week beginning on 13/4/2026) and you will be notified about your presentation dates by Week 4. Each student will have 20 minutes for the individual presentation. At least 5 mintues of this will be reserved for question from the audience and/or your tutor. The presentation will be done in person in the class or online in real time. No recording will be accepted.</p>\n<p>The following questions may help you to prepare for this important assessment task:</p>\n<p>•     What are the languages and varieties the make the local linguistic ecology?</p>\n<p>•     What are their current statuses?</p>\n<p>•     What are the goals and purposes of the languages and varieties?</p>\n<p>•     How did these languages come to have the current statuses?</p>\n<p>•     Where do the different languages fit on the language status scale?</p>\n<p>•     What are the key language issues and challenges facing the polity?</p>\n<p>•     How have these challenges impacted the society?</p>\n<p>•     What are the language situations likely to be in the future?</p>\n<p>•     What recommendations can be provided for dealing with language issues now and in the future?</p>\n<p>You should remember that you are doing this presentation as students of language policy and planning. As such, you have to make use of relevant LPP concepts that you will learn in the course in their presentation.</p>\n<p>You may use AI tools to assist you in preparing for this assignment.

Your task is to identify a language-related problem or need within the institution, propose an appropriate policy response, and explain how the policy could be implemented using available resources.</p>\n<p>This is a practical task that focuses on designing realistic language policies for institutions. However, your policy must be informed by relevant theories and concepts from the course.
