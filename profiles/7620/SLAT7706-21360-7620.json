INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW</strong> (Face-to-face, to be completed by 4pm Friday, End of Semester Exam Period - EXAM WEEK 1)</p>\n<p>This individual interview provides a valuable opportunity for students to consolidate and articulate key aspects of their conceptual learning as documented in their portfolio. It offers a space for deeper reflection on the <em>concept-based reflections</em>, encouraging students to draw on their blog reflections to explain what they have learned, how their chosen concepts relate to broader literature in applied linguistics, and how the concepts relate to their own contexts. As part of this reflective process, students will be asked to explain their conceptual understanding, justify their arguments, and share personal insights that informed their work. The interview also functions as a checkpoint to support academic integrity by confirming the authenticity and authorship of the submitted portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>The one-on-one interviews do not carry a separate weighting but instead function as academic integrity hurdle requirements (PASS/FAIL)</strong>. <em>While the interview is not weighted, it will be assessed against specific criteria.

A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p>The individual interview is to be completed in-person (not online). Students are encouraged to bring a hard copy or electronic version of their written submission to the interview. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.
