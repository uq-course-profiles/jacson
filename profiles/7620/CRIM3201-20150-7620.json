In our workshop each week, you will work together on various aspects of project planning to progress and develop your ideas collaboratively. Roles in class will be rotated week by week, so each student will have a chance to act as group leader, facilitator/mediator, spokesperson, notetaker, questioner throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>Each week, by the end of the workshop, results of specific tasks (explained in class) will need to be recorded on your group’s Teams page by your group. There is no set word limit for the tasks, but you should ensure that you respond to all the tasks with sufficient detail.</p>\n<p>Your individual contribution to the weekly planning will be assessed by the course coordinator both during your in-class discussions, through the contributions you make on Teams during the session, and through a declaration from each group member about the contributions of each individual to the task.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to attend class every week to ensure their project and group work progresses throughout the semester. However, grades for this assessment will be based on the best 7 attempts. If you are unable to attend a workshop due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, please contact the course coordinator (prior to class) to determine how best to contribute to your team’s project planning for that week.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance and be clear why they have chosen to use AI.
