In this task, students are required to complete and submit a Clinical Practice Portfolio over the course of the semester, in order to document clinical performance within the patient clinic. Students must complete the portfolio for ALL clinical, dental assisting, fail to attend, and observational sessions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a pass, the following conditions must be met in 3 components a, b and c:</p>\n<p><strong>a) Course-specific session sign-off forms </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DUE</strong>: Submitted at the completion of each timetabled clinical session to the nominated Clinical Educator.</p>\n<p><strong>EXTENSIONS</strong>: You cannot apply for an extension for submission of the course-specific session sign-off forms.</p>\n<p><strong>LATE SUBMISSION</strong>: A late or non-submission will result in the session being recorded as a 0= Expectations Not Met (ENM).</p>\n<p><strong>TASK DESCRIPTION</strong>: These forms are essential for tracking performance and must be completed at the end of every AM or PM session where you see a patient. If no patient was seen, submit the Dental Assisting/FTA form. </p>\n<p>Your session form is submitted to, and assessed by, your Clinical Educator and includes:</p>\n<p>1. Clinical performance</p>\n<p>2. Discipline-specific performance (only if you performed relevant procedures)</p>\n<p>3. Fitness to practise (must pass) </p>\n<p>Student marking expectations for each semester are calibrated to your year and stage in the DMD program. You are not being marked against the performance of a fully qualified dentist, but rather according to where you should be for your level of clinical training. Clinical educators will adjust their marking expectations accordingly as you progress throughout the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Session mark</strong>: Fitness to practise is a must pass item, assessed as EM or ENM only. If you receive an ENM in this category, you will receive an ENM as your session mark. </p>\n<p>For example: Each session will be awarded a mark:</p>\n<p>∙ 0 = Expectations Not Met (ENM)</p>\n<p>∙ 2 = Developing (D)</p>\n<p>∙ 3 = Expectations Met (EM)</p>\n<p>∙ 4 = Above Expectations (AE)</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Semester Mark</strong>: The proportion of all course-specific session scores will be calculated at the end of the semester giving the ‘Overall Mark’ as a percentage. At the completion of the semester the total session scores will be added together, divided by the total number of sessions. i.e .e.g. Six sessions with Expectations met and one with Expectations not met (3+3+3+3+3+3+0) = 18, 18 divided by (4 by 7) = 64.3% overall semester grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum performance requirement</strong>: An “Overall Semester Mark” for the Semester will be awarded using the following values:</p>\n<p>Fail (F) = &lt;63% </p>\n<p>Pass (P) = 63-100% </p>\n<p>The pass requirements are based on the DMD year level and semester level, where the average overall score must be a minimum of: ≥ 2.5/4.0 (~62.5%). Students who receive three (3) or more ENM marks for the course-specific sign off sessions will be awarded an overall fail for the assessment item.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>b) Mid-semester portfolio review and case tallies</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DUE</strong>: Submit the two components to your Course Coordinator by 5pm Friday prior to the mid-semester break via ePortfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>EXTENSIONS</strong>: An extension may be applied for this component of the assessment task.</p>\n<p><strong>LATE SUBMISSION</strong>: A late or non-submission will result in 100% penalty of the mark and therefore a fail for the assessment task.</p>\n<p><strong>TASK DESCRIPTION</strong>: This task helps to reflect on clinical progress, feedback integration, and future growth.</p>\n<p>The component includes two parts:</p>\n<p>1. Case tallies for the semester AND a de-identified Patient Management System Treatment Report uploaded, and</p>\n<p>2. A Mid-semester Reflection and Feedback Form.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>c) End-of-semester portfolio review and case tallies</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DUE</strong>: Submit the two components to your Course Coordinator by 5pm Friday of the last week of the Semester via ePortfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>EXTENSIONS</strong>: An extension may be applied for this component of the assessment task. </p>\n<p><strong>LATE SUBMISSION</strong>: A late or non-submission will result in 100% penalty of the mark and therefore a fail for the assessment task.</p>\n<p><strong>TASK DESCRIPTION</strong>: This task helps to reflect on clinical progress, feedback integration, and future growth.</p>\n<p>The component includes two parts:</p>\n<p>1. Case tallies for the semester AND a de-identified Patient Management System Treatment Report uploaded, and</p>\n<p>2. An End-of-semester Reflection and Feedback Form.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum performance requirement</strong>: There are no minimum number of case requirements.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENT</strong>: In accordance with PPL Assessment Procedure Section 3 Part J, supplementary assessment will NOT be available for clinical practice performance (portfolio) as professional competencies are developed through practicums delivered over an extended number of weeks throughout the Semester.
