(Students with an accommodation must contact the course coordinator to arrange alternatives.) They run for 10 weeks (2-6 and 8-12). <strong>Each tutorial is worth 3% (1% for participation and the preparation of a question; 2% for in class exercises).</strong></p>\n<p>Tutorial work enables steady development of skills in philosophical analysis and critical thinking. A Community of Inquiry approach is taken where students work together to discuss the readings. <strong>Students will be judged on their ability to work collaboratively to progress arguments, raise critical questions, and discuss competing interpretations and points of view. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tutorials are mandatory and attendance will be taken. </strong>Marks are not awarded for attendance but for contributions to collective discussion and completion of set tutorial tasks. <strong>Alternative or make-up work will be assigned to students who miss a tutorial due to medical or other legitimate reasons. </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>During tutorials, students are expected to:</p>\n<p>1. Demonstrate evidence of comprehension of the texts assigned for reading each week through preparation and participation in the tutorial. Required readings will be marked 'required' and made available through the Library.</p>\n<p>2. Come to class with a critical question for discussion within your group.</p>\n<p>3. Complete an in-class exercise.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
