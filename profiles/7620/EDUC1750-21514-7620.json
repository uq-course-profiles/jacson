The topic area covered in the activity can be in your preferred curriculum area or otherwise (e.g. English/Literacy; Maths/Numeracy; Social Sciences, etc). The activity should be engaging, interactive and based on a student-centred, constructivist approach to education, and reflect an understanding of adolescent brain development and the most efficient and effective processes of knowledge acquisition. The activity should consider the function of memory and the need to minimise cognitive overload (CC 1.2 – assessed). The activity can be 20-60 minutes in length. You do not need to design a whole lesson, just one activity. The one activity might have an introductory section, a middle part, and a conclusive section that might include a retrieval task to consolidate understanding.</p>\n<p>The assignment has two parts: </p>\n<p><strong> 1. Activity Plan</strong></p>\n<p>You will design an activity plan using a template provided to you on Blackboard. The activity plan will be approximately 500 – 800 words. </p>\n<p>You will need to provide a description of: </p>\n<p>•\tThe context for the activity, where and how it should be done, what knowledge domain (e.g. science; literacy etc) it is in and any other critical information that other teachers would need to know in advance of implementing the activity. You may reference the Australian Curriculum or Queensland Syllabus documents.</p>\n<p>•\tThe intended outcomes of the activity and how it supports knowledge acquisition, and promotes engagement without creating cognitive overload - what do you think the primary students will be able to do or understand at the end of the activity and how does it build on prior knowledge?</p>\n<p>•\tThe resources required for the activity – worked examples, paper, URLs, skipping ropes.....anything in terms of technical materials, tools and sources of information that you will need to do this activity with your students</p>\n<p>•\tA description of what students will be doing - what will you ask the primary students to do at each phase of the activity, how will the activity be designed to reduce extraneous load, will they work alone or in groups/with partners, will there be opportunities to self-check on their progress, and so on.</p>\n<p>•\tAn outline of the instructional guidance for the activity, including where relevant, explicit instruction, worked examples, provision of relevant strategies, scaffolded supports, techniques that support the function of memory, etc. </p>\n<p><strong>Design justification</strong></p>\n<p>The second part of the assignment involves you providing a justification for the design. This section will be approximately 1000 - 1500 words. In this section, you will need to cover the following:</p>\n<p>•\tA description of the learning and development concepts that underpins your design, including a demonstration of an understanding of brain structure, function and development (design: the decisions you took when developing the activity)</p>\n<p>•\tA justification for why the development and learning theories were chosen - provide specific details of theory concepts, ideas and strategies</p>\n<p>•\tAn explanation of how you have drawn on the theory to inform the decisions you made in designing the activity - provide specific details of theory concepts, ideas and strategies</p>\n<p>•\tThe range of teaching strategies that will need to be employed during the activity</p>\n<p>•\tA justification for the resources selected for use in the activity</p>\n<p>•\tA brief reflection on what this task has helped you to understand about how learning and development theories inform practice</p>\n<p>•\tConsider student diversity for all of the above (differentiation)</p>\n<p>•\tA minimum of four references should be used to support your justification and reflection.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
