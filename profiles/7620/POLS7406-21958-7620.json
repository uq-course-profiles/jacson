The first will ask you to briefly define a key concept, based on one of the required readings. You will be assessed on the accuracy of your definition, based on the particular text. The second question will test your understanding of how the same concept is being used by the author(s) in the text. You will be assessed on how accurately you have used the concept, in line with its usage in the text. No half points will be given, so a score of 2 indicates a mostly or very accurate response to a question, 1 is partly accurate, and 0 is mostly or wholly inaccurate.</p>\n<p>I will make the weekly quiz available to the external students at the end of the scheduled seminar for internal students, i.e. after 7pm on Thursdays.
