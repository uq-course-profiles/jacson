            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p><strong>Background</strong>. The purpose of this assessment is to challenge students to design a fit for purpose breeding program. Breeding Programs are foundational to the management of animal populations and have relevance across companion and production animals as well as wildlife species. Breeding programs are often targeted towards enhancing phenotypic traits, something particularly emphasised in companion animals</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>For this task you are to design a breeding program based on a scenario and species of your choice. Your assignment is to develop a ten-year breeding program based upon your breeding objective. You will provide a comprehensive report detailing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Population Brief</li>\n<li>Breeding Objective</li>\n<li>Traits of Importance</li>\n<li>Trait Management</li>\n<li>Breeding Management</li>\n<li>Evaluation of Success</li>\n<li>Ten-year Progress Prediction</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>General Formatting and Communication</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Task Size – There is no set limit for this, however a maximum of 3500 words will be applied.</em></strong></p>\n<p>What this means is the entirety of your assessment will not exceed 3500 words, this includes your in-text citations BUT excludes the reference list provided at the end.</p>\n<p>Some of you will ask if there is a margin on the word count, yes there is, our general rule is ± 10%, however in this instance I am going to put the hard line on 3500 words. If your submission is above this threshold, your work will be graded to 3500 words and surplus content beyond this will not be considered for your grade.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Referencing style</em></strong></p>\n<p>I am requesting the use of Journal of Animal Science formatting. The reason is simple; in my opinion this is the most simplistic and discipline relevant citation style that exists for us. However, I don’t get too hung up on this, as long as you are consistent with your approach and it's not a numbered format, we will be okay.</p>\n<p><strong><em>General Formatting</em></strong></p>\n<p>Your assessment must be typed, 1.5-to-2.0-line spacings are okay, font size 12, in Australian (British) English and neatly presented. But again, consistency is the key, I don’t get too hung up on this unless there is an inconsistent approach then you will find a comment from me on your submission. So, think of these as general guidelines. Communicating your thoughts in a concise and grammatically correct manner is essential to any written document, here at The University of Queensland or outside this institution, please take care in the preparation of your assessment. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Credibility &amp; References</em></strong></p>\n<p>You will need to do some reading of the scientific literature, so you are encouraged to choose a topic, well at least a species, that is of interest to you. Selecting a topic that is of interest to you will make this task more enjoyable to complete, otherwise you will find it a dreadful task that you will take nothing away from. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</em></strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be acknowledged (in the form of an AI declaration) appropriately. Please see assessment guidelines in BlackBoard course site for specific instructions.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A more comprehensive guideline and grading rubric will be provided to you on BlackBoard. </strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
