The essay questions are linked to the weekly tutorial topics. You will be asked to sign up for an essay topic at the start of semester. You only need to write one essay. You must submit an essay in order to pass the course.</p>\n<p>Essay sign-up is on a first-in basis via Blackboard. Sign-up opens in Week 1. Please choose your topic by the end of Week 3. If you have not signed up for a topic by the end of Week 3, you will be randomly allocated to one of the remaining available topics. If you need to change your topic after Week 3, you will need to write to the course coordinator to request a change (subject to availability).</p>\n<p>Your essay must be submitted using Turnitin by 2pm Thursday in the week after the tutorial at which that topic was discussed. For example, if you choose to write on the topic for Week 3, you must submit your essay by 2pm (14:00) on Thursday in Week 4. The exact due date for each essay topic can be found in the Tutorial Programme. Please take account of the due date when choosing an essay topic and plan your time accordingly.</p>\n<p>A reading list for each topic can also be found in the Tutorial Programme. It is essential that you use the Required Reading in writing your essay, including the ancient sources.</p>\n<p>General guidance on essay-writing can be found in the <em>Classics and Ancient History Study Guide</em> and Study Videos (on Blackboard). Further guidance will be provided in class.</p>\n<p>Your essay must follow the referencing requirements and style set out in the <em>Study Guide</em> and videos. It is recommended that you do not use AI in researching or writing your essay and any AI use must be referenced.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</em></p>\n<p><em>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<p><em>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
