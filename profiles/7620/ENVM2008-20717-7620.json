Following the fieldtrip, you will write a structured reflection and submit your work before the advised due date and time.</p>\n<p>The field trip is <strong>compulsory</strong> and costs approximately <strong>$30 per student</strong>. It is crictical that students attend the fieldtrip for the best outcome of your assessment. The fieldtrip details will be announced during the semester. Please refer to the Blackboard announcement for the actual cost of the excursion, meeting location, date and time. You will need to organise your own transport to the meeting location at the Museum of Brisbane.</p>\n<p>Students who miss the field trip will be offered an alternative option to visit the museum independently to still submit the assessment by the due date. The disadvantage is that you will not receive the guided tour experience organised by the Museum. The Course Coordinator will provide the necessary information for students to complete a self‑guided tour and identify the sites they need to visit. You may only be eligible for alternative arrangement if exceptional circumstances arise that prevent you from attending the fieldtrip. Please contact your course coordinator with supporting documentation of the exceptional circumstances that prevented you from attending for consideration of an alternate arrangement.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
