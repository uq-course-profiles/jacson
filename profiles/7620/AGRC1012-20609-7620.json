It is a practical and comprehensive approach to learning. This method introduces students to the real-world dynamics of agribusiness and equips them with a powerful analytical tool to examine its operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Structure (15% total):</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment has two components:</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: BMC Submission (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>Individual Business Model Canvas analysis based on the field trip</p>\n<p>Submit via Turnitin by the due date: 27/03/2026 14:00 pm</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Peer Assessment and Feedback (5%)</strong></p>\n<p>In-class peer review session (Week 6), where you review another student's BMC submission </p>\n<p>Provide structured written feedback addressing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strengths of the BMC analysis</li>\n<li>Weaknesses or gaps identified</li>\n<li>Areas for improvement with specific recommendations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You will be graded on the quality of feedback you provide</strong></p>\n<p>Attendance at the Week 6 peer assessment session is compulsory to complete this component</p>\n<p><strong>About the Business Model Canvas: </strong></p>\n<p>The BMC is a strategic management template for developing new business models or documenting and analysing existing ones. It visually outlines a business's nine key building blocks, making it easier to understand how a company operates, generates value, and sustains itself in the competitive market. These blocks include:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Value Propositions: </strong>What value does the business promise to deliver to its customers? This component focuses on the problem the business solves or the need it fulfils.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Customer Segments:</strong> Who are the business's target customers? Identifying the specific segments the business serves is crucial for tailoring its value propositions.</p>\n<p>3.<strong> Channels:</strong> How does the business reach customer segments to deliver the value proposition? This involves the company's marketing and distribution strategies.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Customer Relationships:</strong> What relationship does the business establish with its customer segments? This could range from personal assistance to automated services.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Revenue Streams: </strong>How does the business earn money? This block examines the company's various sources of income.</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Key Resources:</strong> What critical assets are essential for the business to deliver its value proposition? Resources can be physical, intellectual, human, or financial.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Key Activities:</strong> What are the most important activities the business must do to deliver its value proposition? This includes production, problem-solving, and platform/network maintenance.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>Key Partnerships:</strong> Who are the business's key partners or suppliers? Partnerships are crucial for optimising operations, reducing risks, and acquiring resources.</p>\n<p>9. <strong>Cost Structure:</strong> What are the business's major cost drivers? Understanding the cost structure is vital for ensuring the business model is financially viable.</p>\n<p>By analysing an agribusiness through the lens of the BMC, students will gain insights into how the business creates, delivers, and captures value. This hands-on experience deepens their understanding of the theoretical aspects of business models and enhances their analytical skills by applying the BMC to a real-world context. Addressing all nine building blocks allows students to develop a holistic view of the business's operational, financial, and strategic foundations, preparing them for future roles in business development, strategic planning, and entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. The use of AI or MT must be referenced appropriately.

Each group will select and briefly introduce an Australian agribusiness during class. The students are tasked with preparing an 8-minute presentation on their chosen business, which will be conducted in class.</p>\n<p>To complete the task effectively and prepare an engaging presentation, follow these structured steps:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Choose Your Product</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by selecting a food or fibre product that interests you. This could be anything from a type of vegetable, fruit, grain, meat product, or even a processed food item.</li>\n<li>Consider a product that has relevance to your region, personal interest, or one that has been in recent news for being innovative or controversial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Research Firms in the Three Sectors</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. Food Sector</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for a company that is involved in preparing, marketing, or selling the final food product to consumers. Examples include restaurants, food service companies, or retail brands.</li>\n<li>Utilise the Internet, business databases, or food industry reports to find a company related to your chosen product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. Production Agriculture Sector</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify a farm or agricultural business that grows or raises the primary ingredient(s) for your chosen product.</li>\n<li>Search for direct producers, cooperatives, or family farms. Use agricultural directories, farming association websites, and agricultural research databases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>C. Input Supply Sector</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find a company that supplies the raw materials, machinery, seeds, or other inputs required for producing your chosen product.</li>\n<li>Look into suppliers of seeds, fertilisers, farming equipment, or financial services like loans and insurance tailored to agriculture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Gather Information on Each Firm</strong></p>\n<p>For each company you identify, research and note down the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overview and Market Presence:</strong> Size of the firm, location, scope of operations (local, national, international), and the markets they serve.</li>\n<li><strong>Products and Services:</strong> Specific products or services they offer, especially as related to your chosen food or fibre product.</li>\n<li><strong>Link to Your Product:</strong> Explain how each firm is involved in the lifecycle of your chosen product, from production to market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Compare and Contrast the Firms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyse the similarities and differences in their market approach, size, geographical presence, and role in the food production and marketing system.</li>\n<li>Consider aspects such as their contribution to the economy, employment, sustainability practices, and innovation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Identify Challenges</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research and reflect on the various challenges each firm faces, such as regulatory hurdles, supply chain issues, market competition, environmental concerns, and changing consumer preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Prepare Your Presentation (8 Minutes)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Briefly introduce your chosen product and the importance of understanding its production and marketing system.</li>\n<li><strong>Company Overviews:</strong> Present a slide for each firm, summarising key points from your research. Use visuals like logos, product images, or infographics to make it engaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Linkages and Analysis:</strong> Explain how these firms are interconnected and their significance in your product's context. Use diagrams or charts to illustrate these connections.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Discuss the main challenges these firms face, offering insights into how they impact the production and distribution of your product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question and Answer Session: </strong>Following your presentation, there will be a 2-minute Q&amp;A period where the class and/or instructor may ask questions. All group members should be prepared to respond to questions about the content.</p>\n<p>Please note: Although this is a group project, each student will be graded individually based on their own section of the presentation. Each group member is responsible for clearly delivering and demonstrating their own contribution during the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Submission: </strong>Only one group member needs to submit the presentation materials on behalf of the group. Please ensure all group members' names are clearly listed on the submission.</p>\n<p>Students are required to form their groups during Week 1. If a student has not joined or formed a group by <strong>9 Mar 2026 (Week 3)</strong>, they should contact the course coordinator immediately so they can be placed in one. If a student has not made contact by <strong>9 Mar 2026</strong>, the course coordinator will assign them to a group on <strong>10 Mar 2026</strong>. Please note: students who do not join a group will be encouraged to withdraw from the course, as there are some assessments that are group-based. </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
