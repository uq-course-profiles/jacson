Content may be drawn from, but is not limited to, lecture slides, tutorial materials, and Blackboard resources. This assessment is designed to evaluate students’ breadth and depth of learning, including both theoretical understanding and applied practical knowledge developed throughout the Semester 1 course.</p>\n<p>To participate, students must have a laptop with the Inspera safe browser installed. It is recommended to arrive 10 minutes early for ID verification and to set up the locked browser on their computers. Students should ensure their laptops are fully charged and bring a charger.</p>\n<p>For those without a laptop and internet access (connect to Eduroam), the option to borrow a laptop from the Library may be available (<a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/laptop-loans\">https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/laptop-loans</a>).</p>\n<p>Once the exam commences, access will be restricted to the Inspera test browser, and communication via email on the device used for the exam will not be possible.</p>\n<p>To minimise disruptions, students are advised to turn off phones and other devices (including wearables and tablets), either store them in lockers and bags, or place them face down on the floor.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
