Your essay should respond to one of the topics listed below. It should be based on original research in the relevant historical literature, with at least 10 items listed in your bibliography.</p>\n<p><strong>Topics:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Analysis of a Historian</strong>. Take an important historian from the nineteenth-, twentieth-, or twenty-first century and assess their larger significance for modern historical practice. How has their work been received by the profession and how should we regard their overall contribution to their field of study? </li>\n<li><strong>Analysis of a History</strong>. Take a major work of history (i.e. history book) published no earlier than the nineteenth century as your focus. How can we best characterise the author’s approach and how has it influenced or contributed to its field of study?</li>\n<li><strong>Analysis of a School of History. </strong>Take a major school or theory of historical scholarship as your focus. Critically assess the context in which this school or theory emerged. What essential concepts characterise the work of this school or theoretical approach? What has it contributed to historical scholarship and/or practice?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Referencing style:</strong> Students must use Chicago style for references (footnotes) and bibliographies: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html</p>\n<p><strong>Word Limits: </strong>A word count that is within ±10% of the set length (2,200 words) is acceptable. Word count does not include bibliography or footnotes; however, discursive footnotes are included in the word count. A word count that is outside these 10% will receive a proportionate penalty and will be graded against the grading criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>AI: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. Students must also fill out an AI disclosure sheet and submit it as the cover page for their essay.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
