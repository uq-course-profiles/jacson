Minimal attendance will be three days per week unless variation is approved by the Course coordinator. Students are required to submit a diary of days attended, which must be signed by the placement’s supervisor. <strong>Attendance constitutes an essential component of Professionalism and Communication in the Work Integrated Learning Placement Performance assessment and is a hurdle (must pass) requirement.</strong></p>\n<p>The Course coordinator, student and placement supervisor will collaborate to ensure that the timing of the placement maximises the learning opportunities with regards case load and case variation. Students may be required to participate in on-call and/or after-hours rosters. Students are expected to ensure that all cases and responsibilities are updated and handed over/finalised in a safe and professional manner. Students should regularly seek informal feedback on their performance from placement supervisors.</p>\n<p>Attendance is compulsory unless there are valid reasons for not being able to do so. Missed days are required to be made-up. The placement supervisor and Course coordinator must be notified as soon as possible when days are missed and supporting documentation (e.g. medical certificate or written explanation describing the extenuating circumstances) promptly provided to the Course coordinator. <strong>If missed days cannot be completed within the scheduled period of the placement, students must request an extension via my.UQ My Requests</strong> (See below – Extension or Deferral availability).</p>\n<p>Permission to not attend one or more placement days may be granted by the Course coordinator but only for valid reasons. Again, such days will need to be made-up.</p>\n<p>The scheduling of missed days will be at the discretion of the placement supervisor and <strong>involve negotiation between the student and the placement supervisor</strong>. It should be noted that scheduling days missed can be problematic and may not be possible in the current academic year, which would delay graduation. </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>As noted above, attendance is compulsory. Final placement assessment will not be provided until all missed days are completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement performance is based on four (4) categories.</strong></p>\n<p>1)     Knowledge</p>\n<p>2)     Technical skills</p>\n<p>3)     Clinical skills (or discipline specific skills)</p>\n<p>4)     Communication and Professionalism</p>\n<p>Each category has five (5) possible responses based on attitude, aptitude and abilities shown during the placement. Scores are allocated based on placement supervisor feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Each category MUST be passed, which requires a score of SATISFACTORY or higher. </strong>Failure to achieve a passing score, following discussion between the student and the Course coordinator, will necessitate a period of remediation, the duration of which will be determined by the Course coordinator. If, at the conclusion of the period of remediation, the student again receives a failing score, the student will be awarded a failing grade and may or may not be eligible for supplementary assessment.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Physical exam of this patient revealed a 1 cm mass, reasonably firm, caudal to its coelom, which was consistent with its left kidney. To further confirm diagnosis, an ultrasound was carried out on this patient. Ultrasound revealed a vascularized hyperechoic mass in the caudal coelom.</p>\n<p>An exploratory surgery was carried out in this patient. Prior to premedication, the patient’s vitals were taken and recorded as followed: HR 70, RR 4 and temperature: 23.8. Patient was premedicated with Hydromorphone 0.5mg/kg (0.02ml) via intramuscular injection (IM). It was then induced with Alfaxalone 10mg/kg (0.38ml) via IM and was intubated with a size 24G catheter. Throughout the procedure, patient was maintained at 0.5% oxygen due to its size and was connected to a ventilator. Patient was monitored with a capnograph, a Doppler and an ECG. The enterectomy revealed a faecal impaction, which was successfully removed. It seemed like there was potentially a partial GIT wall perforation from the hard segment.</p>\n<p>The patient had an uneventful recovery post surgery and was given the following medications:</p>\n<p>1.      Tramadol 10mg/kg 0.02ml IM q24 hours</p>\n<p>2.      Ceftazidime 20mg/kg 0.02ml IM q72 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Patient outcome:</strong></p>\n<p>Patient did well post surgery and was sent home after a night of monitoring with the following medications for the next 10 days.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Research derived from various literature sources must be evident.</li>\n<li>Conclusion: Should also include nursing key points learned from the case, special skills and/or specialised monitoring equipment utilised during the case management. </li>\n<li>Presentations should be created using PowerPoint or Prezi and brought on a memory stick.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you wish to take photographs to support your presentation, you must seek permission from the practice you are attending and the patient details must be de-identified for confidentiality.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
