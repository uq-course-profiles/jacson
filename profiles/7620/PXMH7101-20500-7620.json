Diagnostic systems are criticised on a range of fronts, not least of which is that categorical systems are frequently a poor fit for painting an accurate picture of an individual’s personal experience of mental illness or psychological distress. The most dominant system of diagnosis for mental health is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V-TR).</p>\n<p>Select a specific diagnosis from the DSM-V-TR (e.g. Generalised Anxiety Disorder, not ‘anxiety’). Write a 2500-word analytical essay exploring how the diagnostic approach of the DSM-V-TR assists, or does not assist in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understanding the difficulties which have brought an individual into treatment for this condition, and</li>\n<li>determining the most appropriate pathway forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contrast your findings with an alternative nosological approach (for instance, the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual [PDM-2]) and from your research develop a compelling conclusion as to the role of diagnosis in mental health practice. </p>\n<p>Please consult with staff for legitimate use of AI for this essay.

Compare and contrast your findings with the approach taken by an appropriate alternative nosological framework in understanding the symptoms and personal experience of the consumer with your chosen condition</p>\n<p>3. Using your experience of evaluating these diagnostic approaches, as well as literature on diagnosis from a research, clinical and lived-experience perspective, present your critical evaluation of the role of diagnosis in mental health practice.</p>\n<p>5.

The argument is that if empirical research has supported the efficacy of a treatment, it must be effective. This position is flawed as empirical research typically demonstrates reliable clinical change only for a percentage of consumers. In essence, no treatment works for everyone to the same degree.</p>\n<p>Choose a diagnostic disorder from the DSM-V-TR (NOT \"Depression\") and examine the research evidence to assist in deciding about appropriate treatment for this disorder. You should compare two different psychotherapy-based treatment approaches for your chosen disorder. You can choose any two different approaches as long as they have been subject to empirical investigation and the differences between them can be clearly articulated. It is suggested that your chosen treatment approaches should each have a minimum of 4 primary (original data, with consumers) studies to refer to.</p>\n<p><strong>Art Therapy Students: </strong>Art Therapy students should<strong> </strong>present on research into an Art Therapy based modality specifically for their chosen disorder. Given the limited pool of research into specific, disorder focused modalities in Art Therapy, students may consider evaluating art-based approaches as a whole for their specific condition.  </p>\n<p>Develop a 10-minute presentation for your colleagues and tutor on your findings, including a critical discussion assessing which approach may be most effective and why. Your critical discussion should include an assessment of common factors and shared mechanisms of change across your chosen modalities which might explain equivocal or disparate effectiveness.</p>\n<p>You will then facilitate a 5 minute discussion with the class addressing any questions arising from your presentation. </p>\n<p>What can be concluded about best EBP with your chosen disorder based on your review?</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Student identifies an appropriate DSM-V disorder and identifies two appropriate treatment approaches that have been subject to empirical investigation and the differences between them can be clearly articulated.</p>\n<p>2. Student compares and critically evaluates the two different treatment approaches for the chosen disorder and reviews at least 4 studies for each approach (a mix of primary research and meta-analysis or meta-synthesis is acceptable if said reviews explore primary research). </p>\n<p>3. Student discusses possible common factors or specific mechanisms of change which might explain equivocal, or disparate treatment efficacy (depending on findings)</p>\n<p>4. Student develops conclusions about evidence-based practice with the chosen disorder based on the review.</p>\n<p>5.
