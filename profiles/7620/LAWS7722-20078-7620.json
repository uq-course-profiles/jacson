The essay should include a summary of the case or statement of compatibility, an analysis that situates the case or statement of compatibility in the domestic and international case law, as well as a reflection on larger themes such as what the case or statement of compatibility says about the state of human rights in Australia. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Think about the following:</p>\n<p>·        Which human rights were relevant and how were they relevant?</p>\n<p>·        Which operative provisions were relevant (such as s 38, s 48 or s 58 of the <em>Human Rights Act 2019</em> (Qld)) and how were they applied?</p>\n<p>·        What did the court or Minister get right? What did they get wrong?</p>\n<p>·        How does the case or statement of compatibility fit with other cases or other statements of compatibility (including in other jurisdictions)?</p>\n<p>·        How does it sit with Australia’s human rights obligations?</p>\n<p>·        From everything you have learned in the seminars in this course, what are the larger themes and lessons that can be drawn? For example, what does the case or statement of compatibility say about the state of any human rights culture in the public sector, in the courts or among politicians in Australia?</p>\n<p>·        What can be done to correct any problems raised by the case or statement of compatibility? What can be done to preserve and build upon what it got right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The paper must be based on current and relevant cases and literature, include a clear hypothesis and present a balanced argument. This means you are required to read and reference case law and literature that supports and criticises your hypothesis. You are also required to reference any thought that is not your own or is considered general knowledge. Research essays should be structured with an introduction, body and conclusion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Citations should comply with the Australian Guide to Legal Citation. Include citations in footnotes rather than a bibliography.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the end of the case note you are also required to include an explanation of your method in 500 words (additional to the 3,500 for the case note). It should cover the following:</p>\n<p>·        What method did you use to select the particular case or statement of compatibility you chose for your case note? Why did you pick that one? How did you identify larger themes and lessons to draw from the case or statement of compatibility?</p>\n<p>·        Did you use AI tools? Why or why not? If you did, which AI tool did you use and how? What prompts did you use and how did you evaluate the outputs? How did you make sure the outputs were accurate and how did you make sure the final version of your case note demonstrates your learning, skills and abilities?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. While students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
