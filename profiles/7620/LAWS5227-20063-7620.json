That is, from weeks 1-6: eg parliamentary law, the composition or distribution of parliament, representation, political participation under the constitution, or distinctive features of the franchise.</p>\n<p>Guidelines will be released on the course website on Monday week 3. The final assignment is due Wednesday week 8. (Given the mid-semester break, that is over 6 weeks to complete it).</p>\n<p>One week prior to the due date (ie Wednesday of week 7) you must submit a one page statement of Research Method. This will be be further explained in the guidelines and class. It is worth 4 marks or 10% of the total for the assignment. It will be marked as: 'acceptable' = 4 marks, 'on time but inadequate' = 2 marks, or 'not submitted' = 0 marks.</p>\n<p>The guidelines will include a choice of set topics. Students may frame an alternative topic, but <em>only </em>after consultation with Graeme Orr as course coordinator. Such a bespoke topic must relate to issues or themes from the first half of the course. Overseas exchange students are encouraged to frame a comparative law topic (eg compare Australia and their home country on a particular issue).  </p>\n<p><em>The word limit for the assignment itself is strict: no words in excess of 2200 will be marked. This limit </em><strong><em>excludes </em></strong><em>citation detail in footnotes</em>. <em>But such notes must not contain discursive material, eg commentary</em>. This word limit is separate from the Research Method statement.</p>\n<p>Given the word limit, consider a sharp focus for your essay. This may mean choosing a narrow question or aspect of a larger topic.  That said, do not just jump into a seemingly 'narrow' question, without reading and thinking 'around' the topic and its context, before framing your assignment in a focused way.</p>\n<p>The assignment is to be submitted as a Word document, via a link on the course website. Late submission without a law school extension will be penalised at the usual rate.  </p>\n<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in this assignment is permitted. But must be disclosed as part of your Research Method statement.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=145\">Student Code of Conduct</a>.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
