The key component of reflection is ensuring the creation of a specific plan to aid learning within the scope of the situation and describing how this action is being undertaken.</p>\n<p><strong>Each reflection should not exceed 500 words. More information and marking rubrics for the SEAL reflections can be found on Learn.UQ in the Assessment folder.</strong> </p>\n<p>Students should consider their individual experiences during their Placement in order to reflect effectively within each of the different schemas described below: </p>\n<p><strong>1. National Competency Standards (NCS) schema:</strong> Please read the relevant <strong><em>National Competency Standards (NCS) Framework for Pharmacists in Australia 2016</em></strong> (as available through the course Blackboard site) and familiarise yourself with the Standards before attending your placement. Students are to reflect on ONE chosen Enabling Competency from the NCS in each reflection. Each selected Enabling Competency should be different from the others. Students should reflect on the level of skills, knowledge or professional attributes they acquired/demonstrated during their placement experience and relate this clearly to the chosen Enabling Competency. Students are also encouraged to reflect on their own unique personal experiences (e.g. feelings, personal attributes, individual strengths/weaknesses at this stage of development, etc). </p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Lifelong Learning (LLL) schema</strong>: Students should reflect on their own future learning needs and how they have used feedback to inform their ongoing development, which will enable them to professionally manage their internship and joining the pharmacy profession. They should focus on how their placement uncovered specific elements of their own practice and learning that they consider to be particularly relevant to their future practice, and for becoming a lifelong learner who will remain committed to their continuing professional development. </p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Employability schema</strong>: Employability can be defined as a “<em>set of capabilities and personal attributes that empower graduates to perform effectively in the workplace, generate opportunities, and create positive social and economic impact”</em>. This Employability Reflection is an opportunity for students to reflect on their own personal experiences in relation to any aspects of their individual employability at this late stage of their student career path. It is strongly recommended that, before the placement, students familiarise themselves with UQ’s Employability Framework for necessary background information on the meaning, definitions, structure, and relevant considerations in preparation for addressing this assessment item: https://employability.uq.edu.au/about/employability-framework. </p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Successful completion of the assessment will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI will provide only limited support and guidance.

If the placement includes a public holiday relevant to that placement site, the students are expected to attend/not attend the placement site in accordance with usual practice at that site e.g. if the facility is not open during the public holiday, then students do not attend and that time is included within the 180 hours. </li>\n<li>In the case of illness, students are NOT expected to attend their placement and should inform their preceptor. Absences should be recorded in InPlace within 24 hours of your absence (<a href=\"https://uq.pressbooks.pub/bachelor-pharmacy-placement-handbook/chapter/record-an-absence-in-inplace/\">instructions here</a>). Students away from their placement site for greater than TWO days due to illness (i.e. on the third day) should obtain a medical certificate and provide this to the School Office and their preceptor. </li>\n<li>Students are advised to contact the Course Coordinator to notify of any prolonged absence (greater than THREE days) from the placement site due to illness. Additionally, irrespective of medical certificates, any cumulative absence over the 6-week period longer than 3 days must be immediately brought to the attention of the Course Coordinator. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs)</h4>\n<p>During the placement experience, students will have the opportunity to undertake or be involved in a range of different activities to help facilitate their learning and build their clinical and professional skills. </p>\n<p>To help further facilitate more structured and specific feedback during the placement, students are required to undertake a minimum of THREE Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) that are relevant to the placement site and the student’s individual learning goals. Students can choose THREE relevant EPAs from the following list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provision of OTC Medicine</li>\n<li>Best Possible Medication History</li>\n<li>Patient Education</li>\n<li>Resolving a Medication Related Problem</li>\n<li>Assessment of Inhaler Technique and Counselling</li>\n<li>Oral Anticoagulant Education</li>\n<li>Teamwork and Collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students are required to submit a <strong>statement of justification</strong> for their choice of EPAs with their EPA self-assessment via ePortfolio. This should just be a short paragraph to provide an explanation of why you have chosen the particular EPAs and why they are relevant to your learning.</p>\n<h4>Student Self-Assessment (for submission to PRECEPTOR)</h4>\n<p>Towards the end of the placement period, students will take time to reflect on their own performance during the specific EPAs they have chosen to undertake and complete a Student Self-Assessment for each EPA via ePortfolio. Clear and simple submission instructions are available on ePortfolio - please read and follow these instructions carefully for submission of the Student Self-Assessment for EACH EPA undertaken. Submission of the Student Self-Assessment for each EPA via ePortfolio to the student's preceptor will trigger an email link to be sent to the preceptor, allowing the preceptor to complete the final entrustment level for each EPA and provide any relevant feedback. </p>\n<p>Students should arrange a time to meet with their preceptor at the end of the placement period for a formal feedback session, to discuss their own self-assessment and the preceptor's feedback. During the session, the preceptor will complete the final entrustment level for each of the EPAs undertaken by the student and provide specific and relevant feedback to the student on their performance, focusing on key areas the student is performing well and key areas that require further development. The student and preceptor should also discuss 2-3 specific actions for the student's future development. </p>\n<h4>EPA Reflection and Individual Learning Plan (ILP) - for Submission to Course Coordinator (Jane Lee)</h4>\n<p>After the placement period is complete, students are required to complete their Reflection and Individual Learning Plan (ILP) for submission via ePortfolio, based on the feedback they have received from their preceptor or other colleagues at the placement site, the entrustment levels assigned for each EPA undertaken and the action plan discussed during the final feedback session with the preceptor. </p>\n<h5>Student Reflection</h5>\n<p>This should be uploaded as a WORD.doc file in ePortfolio. The maximum word count for the student reflection is 500 words. Students can use the SEAL reflection method if they wish, but can also follow a more generalised structure to reflect on their overall experience in undertaking the chosen EPAs during their placement. It is important for students to focus on their learnings, linking actions to their future development. Students can include references or attachments where necessary/appropriate to support their reflection. Further information on reflection can be found at this useful link: <a href=\"https://reflection.ed.ac.uk/reflectors-toolkit\">https://reflection.ed.ac.uk/reflectors-toolkit</a>. </p>\n<h5>Individual Learning Plan (ILP)</h5>\n<p>The ePortfolio provides clear instructions and a template for students to complete their ILP based on their performance in undertaking the EPAs and feedback from their preceptor during their placement. Students should complete each of the relevant boxes in the template prior to submission. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The final Reflection and ILP should be submitted via ePortfolio by<strong> 5pm Friday 27th March 2026.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Recognising the cultural, social and physical diversity of patients is essential to the delivery of a holistic healthcare solution. Socially accountable care focuses on a health care approach where practices are oriented towards community and social impact, promoting equity and prioritising the social determinants of health such as education, employment and environment, while holistic care considers treating the person as a whole, not just as a disease or symptom, and integrates mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and social needs into the care provided. </p>\n<p>As part of building an increased awareness of the diversity of patients encountered across the Community Pharmacy setting, students are required to submit a 2000-word report with the following guidelines: </p>\n<p>Identify a particular group of patients serviced by your pharmacy. Some examples may include, but are not limited to, people in the following categories: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical or Cognitive Disability </li>\n<li>Aged care/Elderly </li>\n<li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People </li>\n<li>Mental Illness </li>\n<li>Culturally/Linguistically Diverse People </li>\n<li>Patients on opioid replacement therapy </li>\n<li>Low socioeconomic demographic</li>\n<li>Paediatric population</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider how your pharmacy caters for the socially accountable and holistic care of your selected patient demographic. <strong>Please consider a broader scope beyond just the usual clinical duties of a pharmacist </strong>(i.e. duties such as webster packs, MedsCheck, medication counselling would be considered usual clinical duties so students should explore other aspects of socially accountable and holistic care beyond these services).</p>\n<p>Some questions to consider may include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What protocols/procedures/training (if any) are in place to assist in the care of these patients (E.g. specially trained staff)? </li>\n<li>What physical assistance (if any) does your pharmacy provide (E.g. wheelchair ramp access, wide aisles, etc)? </li>\n<li>How does the physical layout of the pharmacy consider patients in your specific patient demographic? </li>\n<li>Discuss with your preceptor or other pharmacy staff and consider interviewing some patients/carers for feedback and to gather anecdotal evidence of their personal experiences. Students are encouraged to think creatively about how to gather information relevant here. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perform a literature review of the current evidence for best practice in the care of patients in your chosen demographic. Consider recommendations from relevant governing or professional bodies, Royal Commission recommendations, and relevant publications from contemporary research. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify any gaps between current and best practice and create a plan <strong>specific to your placement pharmacy</strong>, to address gaps/implement any new recommendations to optimise socially accountable and holistic patient care in your chosen patient population. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your report should have a <strong>maximum of 2000 words</strong> and follow the structure outlined in the Learn.UQ course site which also contains the marking criteria.  </p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Successful completion of the assessment will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI will provide only limited support and guidance.
