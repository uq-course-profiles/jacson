Criteria sheets for each component can be found on the Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><strong>1.   Exercise Assessment and Programming: Consisting of a written component (7.5%) and a practical component (7.5%).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Task outline: </strong>You will work in pairs for this task (i.e. both students in the student pair get the same mark). You will be assigned a client who is either living with or has survived cancer, has a mental health condition and/or is older aged. In week 7 you will conduct an initial assessment of the client. 7.5% of this assessment item is based on your practical work during this session; i.e. competency and professionalism. Following the assessment visit, you will write a draft program for the client which will start to be delivered in week 8. You will have 2 days following your assessment visit in week 7 to submit your program draft to your clinical educator who will provide feedback within ~2 days (prior to delivery of the program) allowing you to adjust programming if required. This is not assessed but feedback should assist you with the written component. You will then submit the written component (details below) one week after the initial assessment visit (E.g. in week 7, if your session is Tuesday 9am-10.30, your assessment item will be due by 5pm on Tuesday of week 8).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>This written component (7.5%) will have three parts:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>How does the client information (medical history, additional information, goals and assessment data) impact on the interactions you will have with the client? </li>\n<li>How does the client information (medical history, additional information, goals and assessment results) impact on the exercise prescription you have written for your client?</li>\n<li>Exercise program (using the Proforma)- with potential progressions and regressions during your training sessions with the client.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Reference to appropriate evidence/literature is expected where relevant.</p>\n<p>This task includes:</p>\n<p>  a) Reviewing client information: medical history, doctors notes- what might these mean for the interactions/programming</p>\n<p>  b) Developing an exercise program based on the FITT principle and cognisant of any considerations, goals and objectives identified. This includes exercise delivered during the weekly in-person clinic session and home-based prescription/advice to reduce sedentary behaviour. The program should address the client’s goals and describe progressions for improvement (with timelines for progression) across the 4 weeks of supervised sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>2.   Client interaction, Exercise Session Delivery, and Clinical Reflections: Consisting of clinic work (25%), and a final written report including a home program (10%).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For clinic work, </strong>student pairs work together but are assessed individually. For the final written report including a home program, students work in their pairs for this task (i.e. both students in the student pair get the same mark).</p>\n<p>This assessment item includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clinic Work (25%): </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>a. <strong>           </strong>Clinical reasoning (assessed during the pre- and post-exercise training sessions and the training session) underpinned by relevant knowledge (pathophysiology, pharmacology, psychology and behavioural management). May include demonstrating knowledge and application of pre-training preparation requirements and contraindications to exercise prescription and deliver</p>\n<p>b.            Quality of communication during all aspects of clinical practice and client interactions. Communication should be well structured, accurate, engaging, timely, patient appropriate (language, terminology).</p>\n<p>c.             Quality of exercise delivery (e.g. explanation of exercise to be performed: checks/clarifies client understanding)</p>\n<p>d.            Professionalism (e.g. attire, behaviour and attitude)- <em>this is a pass/fail component and a Hurdle for passing the course</em>.</p>\n<p>e.            SOAP Notes that assess the requirement for, and proficiently implement adjustments to the exercise program based on identified needs. SOAP notes will be completed on the template provided and uploaded to Nookal by 5pm the day following your clinic session. You will be provided with a link and instructions for Nookal upload.</p>\n<p>f.            Equipment handling and clean up</p>\n<p>g.           Clinical reflections to assesses your insight as a reflective practitioner. Reflections are required after your <em>first</em> and <em>final</em> <em>exercise delivery</em> sessions (i.e. not assessment sessions). These should include at minimum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> What worked and why?</li>\n<li>What didn’t work and why?</li>\n<li>What will/would you do to improve the program/enhance client outcomes (if you believe no changes are required, then you must clearly explain why this was the case)</li>\n<li>Provide your partner two things they did really well and two things they could improve on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First reflections should be based on the initial exercise delivery session. Final reflections should be based on all exercise delivery sessions you have completed in the clinic. </p>\n<p>Reflections must be submitted via the appropriate Turnitin link on Blackboard and the name of your document must follow this convention: NAME_Reflection_Submission# (e.g. SMITH_Reflection_1). Font must be double-spaced, Calibri or Times New Roman at size 11 or 12, as preferred. Word count approximately 250-500 words.</p>\n<p><em>If your client misses a clinic session:</em></p>\n<p>In the case that your client is ill/away/unable to attend a scheduled session, you will be required to attend the practical/clinic as per usual. Your reflection should address their absenteeism based on their individual circumstances (i.e. if you were their AEP, what would you do if your client was unable to attend their session?). For example, if your client has missed a session based on hospitalisation for a certain condition, would you send them exercises that they could safely perform in the hospital bed? Why? Why not? What would it include? How will you program for next week’s session considering your patient’s absence this week? You would not be required to upload a SOAP note if your client is absent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Final written report including a home program (10%)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each student pair submits the same written assignment (via Turnitin). The written piece of work should reflect a report that they will send to their client summarising specific aspects of their clinic experience (e.g. Change in objective measures from week 1 to week 6, attendance, goals attained) and a home program that they can continue with.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
