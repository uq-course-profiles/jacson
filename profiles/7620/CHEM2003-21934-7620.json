The quizzes assess both conceptual knowledge and applied analytical skills, ensuring alignment with the learning outcomes of the practical sessions.</p>\n<p>Each quiz may include a combination of multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, and calculation-based questions. Calculation questions require students to interpret experimental data provided in the quiz or generated during the corresponding laboratory session, using appropriate units, significant figures, and chemical reasoning.</p>\n<p>For selected experiments, students will be required to upload an image or digital file of their calibration curve or experimental data plots, such as standard curves or reaction profiles. These submissions assess students’ ability to correctly construct, present, and interpret analytical data.</p>\n<p>All quizzes are completed individually and are designed to support the development of core quantitative and data interpretation skills essential in food chemistry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prac 1 Quiz opens on Friday 14:00 Week 7, due date Friday 14:00 Week 8</li>\n<li>Prac 2 Quiz opens on Friday 14:00 Week 9, due date Friday 14:00 Week 10</li>\n<li>Prac 3 Quiz opens on Friday 14:00 Week 10, due date Friday 14:00 Week 11</li>\n<li>Prac 4 Quiz opens on Friday 14:00 Week 11, due date Friday 14:00 Week 12</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To obtain a mark for the practical classes, students must participate and complete the associated exercises (completing the quiz via Blackboard). If you do not participate in a practical class, or do not provide evidence of your attendance (i.e. signing the attendance sheet), your quiz will not be graded. Refer to late submission notes for more information. </p>\n<p>Students are responsible for ensuring a stable internet connection while undertaking an online test/quiz. </p>\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting – if students experience any technical difficulties during the online test/quiz: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not close the browser window. </li>\n<li>Contact AskUs <strong>immediately</strong>: <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/app/chat/chat_launch_lib/p/45\">support.my.uq.edu.au/app/chat/chat_launch_lib</a> – if the technical issue cannot be resolved, ask for a copy of the chat. </li>\n<li>Document the problem – if you receive an error message or similar, take a copy of the message, note the time/date of the problem, which web browser you used, exactly what you were doing at the time and any other relevant information. </li>\n<li>Email your course coordinator (copy in AGFS Admin – <a href=\"mailto:agriculture@enquire.uq.edu.au\">agriculture@enquire.uq.edu.au</a>) with your documented evidence and a copy of the AskUs chat. Any delays in this communication being received may impact the advice that could be provided to you. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory practical class attendance.</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to attend the practical each week to complete the practical and the practical quiz. To obtain a grade for the quiz associated with a particular practical class, students must attend and complete the associated experiments. If you do not attend a practical class or do not provide evidence of your attendance (i.e. signing the attendance sheet), your quiz for that particular practical will not be marked/graded.</p>\n<p>Students who cannot attend a practical due to medical reasons, accident, bereavement, jury service and other circumstances allowed in the UQ Policies and Procedures Library (PPL) should apply for a Practical Absence (refer to Task Description for Practical Quizzes).</p>\n<p><strong>Practical attendance and punctuality</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to arrive on time and be present for the pre-laboratory briefing, safety instructions, and explanation of experimental procedures. For safety, equity, and disruption-minimisation reasons, students who arrive more than 15 minutes after the scheduled start time will not be permitted to enter the laboratory or participate in the practical session. Late arrival compromises safety briefings and disrupts laboratory workflows.</p>\n<p>Students who are unable to attend a practical session or who arrive too late to be admitted must follow the University’s procedures for absence and apply for consideration in accordance with University policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Absence from a Practical Session</strong> </p>\n<p>If you are unable to complete your timetabled practical session because of circumstances beyond your control (e.g., illness) you must <a href=\"https://studenthub.uq.edu.au/form.aspx?id=5913956.\">submit a practical absence </a><a href=\"https://studenthub.uq.edu.au/form.aspx?id=5913941\"> request</a> immediately accompanied by acceptable supporting documentation.  </p>\n<p>A list of acceptable reasons and required supporting documentation is found at <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension?p=1\">https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension?p=1#1</a>  </p>\n<p>Your request must be submitted <strong>prior to or on the day of the</strong> missed practical. The submission link can be found in the Learning Resources (Blackboard Original) or Course Resources (Blackboard Ultra) folder in your course Blackboard site.  </p>\n<p>Requests without the correct supporting documentation may not be approved. If the reason for your absence is not approved, you will be considered absent from that practical session.  </p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to submit an application and provide correct documentation.  </p>\n<p>If there is an associated assessment item, you must submit the relevant assessment item by the due date. If the reason for your absence impacts your ability to meet the due date, you must apply for an extension of assessment due date.  </p>\n<p>If you require access to restricted online resources such as videos to complete your assessment, you must contact the course coordinator to get access to the online resources.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
