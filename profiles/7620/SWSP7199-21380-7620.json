The scenarios will contain information about the legal issue, the client group and the type of agency you are working in.</li>\n<li>Based on your chosen scenario, you are required to develop an <strong>information sheet for service users</strong> that helps to explain the relevant legislation and processes associated with the legal matter and the way in which social workers can provide support through the process.</li>\n<li><strong>Write an essay</strong> that reflects on why it is important for social workers to have an understanding of the legal issue, legislation and court processes associated with the scenario. In conjunction with the course readings, it would be beneficial to consult the Australian Association of Social Workers' Code of Ethics (2020) and Practice Standards (2023) to inform your reflection.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
