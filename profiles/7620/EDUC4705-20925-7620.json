Include a clear statement of the issue to be investigated, and let the reader know why this issue is important and how it connects with a particular professional learning need you have identified from the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers to improve your practice.</p>\n<p>2. Provide a clear statement of your <strong>research questions </strong>- ensure these are linked to the research problem.</p>\n<p>3. Provide a relevant<strong> literature review </strong>on research findings in the area of your proposed project. Acquaint readers with existing studies: what has been found, who has done the work, when and where latest research studies were completed, what approaches were taken. Present information on the articles' findings in a way that provides an integrated argument in relation to the issue. Conclude by establishing the need for the research you plan to conduct by explaining how your project extends from or fills a small gap in the current literature.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Research methodology</strong>. Describe your research methodology or approach. Spell out your research design – what is the context of your study? Who/what will be the object(s) of or the participants in your study? How will you select your research participants, if applicable? What instruments will you use to collect your data? How will you collect and record your data? How will you analyse your data? Ask yourself: With the information provided, could your study be replicated?</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Ethical considerations</strong>. Provide a discussion of the ethical considerations attached to your research project and the methodology you ar going to use.
