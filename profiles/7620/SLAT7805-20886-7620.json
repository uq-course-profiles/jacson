Alternatively, you may use the 'notes' function to answer the weekly question, supplementing your answer with links to useful videos, journal articles, or other online resources. There is no minimum or maximum word limit on these submissions. Students will receive guidance, examples and training in the Week 1 tutorial about how to create these materials and upload them to the RIPPLE platform. <em>The learning materials should be designed so as to be useful for MA-level students in understanding SLAT7805 course content</em>. </p>\n<p>There are 12 weeks of content in SLAT7805, and <strong>students must complete at least 10 sets of learning materials to pass SLAT7805</strong>. RIPPLE tracks the number of materials students create. You have two weeks to complete each weeks' content from the Monday that week begins.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is a short evaluation component for other students' learning materials. All SLAT7805 students should evaluate at least <strong>three</strong> other students' learning materials per week, for<strong> a minimum of 30 evaluations</strong> required to pass SLAT7805. Again, training on how to evaluate other's materials will be provided in the Week 1 tutorial. RIPPLE tracks the number of evaluations students complete. </p>\n<p>Students' evaluations will leave a 'ranking' for the created learning materials, and students can use these materials to help them better understand weekly content.</p>\n<p>This part of the assessment is a PASS/FAIL hurdle - you MUST <strong>complete the 10 learning materials / 30 moderations or you cannot pass this assessment.</strong></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>PART 2</strong></p>\n<p>For the REFLECTION part of the assessment, students need to produce a VIDEO REFLECTION on the process and outcomes of creating their learning materials and evaluating the materials of others. Students should:</p>\n<p>A) Comment specifically<em> </em>on ONE of their highest-ranked sets of learning materials and explain why/how these materials were chosen and how they might improve others' knowledge of SLAT7827 course content</p>\n<p>B) Comment on TWO specific sets of learning materials supplied by others that the student ranked highly or found particularly useful, and how these improved the student's knowledge of SLAT7827 course content.</p>\n<p><strong>This video reflection should be approximately 5 minutes long.</strong> A link to upload the video will be given in the relevant 'assessment' folder in the course Blackboard site, with instructions also provided by your tutor prior to upload. A PPT is permitted to show the learning materials you are talking about as well as any references you want to provide but you CANNOT read out your reflection from a PPT - when giving your reflection, you must simply talk to the camera showing your face in full screen mode.</p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

You will be assigned ONE set only, with the assignment provided in Week 5. The dataset may be taken from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adult L2 learner data</li>\n<li>A short transcript from a classroom exchange</li>\n<li>A list of learner-produced sentences illustrating a pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Your task is to:</strong></p>\n<p>a) Identify 2–3 linguistic features relevant to acquisition (e.g., phonology, vocabulary (lexis), syntax, morphology, semantics, pragmatics, word order, negation, question formation, inflection, etc.) (approximately 150 words). A “feature” refers to a systematic pattern evident across the data (not isolated errors), such as developmental sequencing, overgeneralisation, omission, or form–function mismatch, etc. You will be given a table to complete for this part of the assessment.</p>\n<p>b) Explain the features using TWO SLA theories covered in Weeks 1–6. (approximately 300 words each = 600 words). The two theories selected must come from different theoretical traditions (e.g. one generative/structural (e.g. UG/Error Analysis/Contrastive Analysis) and one functional/interactionist/behaviourist/cognitive; or one cognitive, one interactionist, etc.). A 'cheat sheet' about each theory and what it claims/does not claim about learner language will be provided for you to help you.</p>\n<p>c) Argue which theory better accounts for the learner’s linguistic behaviour (or, vice versa, which theory cannot account for this behaviour), using a personal (but critical) reflection (500 words). In your reflection, explicitly consider at least two of the following: explanatory power, treatment of variability/errors, learnability assumptions, and pedagogical implications. “Personal” refers to your reasoned evaluation as an emerging SLA scholar, rather than anecdotal teaching experience or unsupported opinion.</p>\n<p>The total word count is 1250 words with 10% +/- allowed.</p>\n<p><strong>Theories you may refer to (anything covered in Weeks 1-6, although content from Week 7 may be permitted):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Behaviourism</li>\n<li>Universal grammar (UG)</li>\n<li>Error analysis</li>\n<li>Contrastive analysis</li>\n<li>Interactionist approaches (e.g. input, negotiation for meaning, output)</li>\n<li>Functionalist approaches (e.g. basic variety, interlanguage)</li>\n<li>Cognitive approaches (e.g. skill acquisition, processability, usage-based)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>You will be evaluated on your ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) Accurately analyse unfamiliar language data (25%)</li>\n<li>b) Apply SLA theories correctly and critically (25%)</li>\n<li>c) Compare theories with clear reasoning (25%)</li>\n<li>d) Provide a personal but justified argument (25%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rubric for grades 1-7 can be found in the 'assessment' folder.</p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
