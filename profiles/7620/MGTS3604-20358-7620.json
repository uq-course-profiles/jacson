            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment challenges you to showcase your comprehension of crucial human capital development principles and frameworks. You will demonstrate this by analysing a real-world case study, crafting a solution or recommendation, and presenting your findings with clarity and impact in a concise Executive Summary. <strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: Your work should focus on demonstrating your critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than simply summarising the case study.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Task description: </strong></p>\n<p>You are required to work in teams to prepare Executive Summaries based on the case studies related to human capital development within an organization. For each seminar, students must read the relevant case study aligned with the seminar topic. All case studies are available in the Learning Resources section on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>In this course, you will be placed into a group for the semester. As a formative learning exercise in weeks 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11and 12, your group can choose to prepare a brief executive summary (600-750 words) relating to the case study. This assessment requires you to only submit <strong>five (5)</strong> executive summaries for marking over the semester. Whether you choose to prepare an executive summary each week is up to your group to decide. Completing more summaries will be helpful for you in making sure the five (<strong>5)</strong> executive summaries you choose to submit are of a high standard. The questions you need to respond to in your executive summaries relating to the case studies for each week are available in the Blackboard. It is recommended that you shall come to class prepared with notes, meet in groups of about <strong>four/five</strong> to critically analyse the case and respond to the burning question(s). Based on the group discussions, you then write up an Executive Summary <strong>as a group</strong> for that case outlining their analysis and proposing recommendations that are justified clearly using course concepts, ideas, and theories. </p>\n<p>At the end of each Executive Summary, you will be required to submit details of the contributions of each member of the group. Contributions will be used to adjust students' individual group assignment results.</p>\n<p>Your facilitator will provide you with feedback on your submission each week so that you can make improvements where needed in your subsequent submissions. The <strong>best 5 marks out of 7</strong> will contribute towards the final grade for each group. <strong>Each group will submit the Executive Summary both in Blackboard and Turnitin. </strong>Students will submit it during the seminar only.</p>\n<p>In completing this assignment students will have demonstrated their ability to work collaboratively in a group, identify issues in the real-world context, make a professionally written submission, apply multi-disciplinary knowledge, and produce a well-reasoned and evidence-based argument.</p>\n<p><strong>A Note on Teamwork:  </strong></p>\n<p>•\tAlthough we hope all team members will work happily with each other and learn from each other, problems can occur. If so, please first deal with this issue immediately with your team member. To excel as business leaders, you will need to deal openly, constructively, and in a timely manner with any issues in your team.</p>\n<p>•\tConsistent problematic issues regarding team member participation will prompt a meeting with the course-coordinator with the intent to reintegrate the erring member. Uncooperative members run the risk of having their grade reduced to account for their behavior’s assumed negative effect on their team’s project and as a deterrent to social loafing.</p>\n<p>•\tIt is strongly recommended that each team appoint a Secretary-Recorder (This can be a rotating or shared role), who will maintain a log of all team activities (including attendance at meetings and team member follow-through on commitments) for my review upon request in the event of problematic team members.</p>\n<p>•\tYou are encouraged to have a Leader to facilitate the teamwork. Again, this can be a rotating or shared role to give everyone the opportunity to lead. </p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</em></p>\n<p><em>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
