Your pitch should clearly communicate the story idea, why it matters now, and why your audience will care. Treat it as a real professional pitch: concise, purposeful, and grounded in evidence.</p>\n<p>Your story idea must be original and based on a genuine issue, event, or development within your local community. You must propose at least two primary sources - real people you can contact and interview for Assessment 3. Family members are not permitted. You are encouraged to make initial contact or attempt a short pre-interview where appropriate.</p>\n<p>You must include a preliminary contact list for your nominated sources (names, roles, and contact details) in your brief. This demonstrates that your reporting plans are feasible and that your sources are accessible.</p>\n<p>Your pitch should address:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your angle: </strong>what the story is really about and why it matters.</li>\n<li><strong>Newsworthiness:</strong> why this is a news story, and what it offers your outlet’s audience.</li>\n<li><strong>Core facts:</strong> the who, what, when, where, why, and how.</li>\n<li>Your proposed <strong>primary sources</strong> and why they are the right voices for this story.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevant secondary material</strong> (e.g., public data, statements, reports, online sources). NOT other news stories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will develop this same idea into a full news story for Assessment 3. Read the Assessment 3 description to ensure you pitch something workable, timely, and reportable.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI:</strong></p>\n<p> Generative AI is permitted in the development of your written pitch as a writing tool, not as a substitute for editorial judgment. The story itself must originate from your own reporting idea, and all sources must be real people you are able to contact and interview. AI cannot be used to invent sources, quotes, events, or any form of fabricated material. Misuse will be treated as academic misconduct and a fail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Story Brief – 350 – 450 words - 15% of 30</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside your pitch, you will submit a detailed story brief compiled as one .pdf file. The purpose of the brief is to demonstrate the depth of your research, the logic behind your angle, and the practical steps you will take to report the story. This document mirrors the briefing notes used by professional journalists and producers when preparing a reporter or presenter for a story. It should stand on its own, clear enough that another journalist could pick it up and understand your rationale, the story context, the sources, and the reporting plan.</p>\n<p>Your brief should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context and significance:</strong> What is the wider issue or development your story sits within? Why does it matter now?</li>\n<li><strong>Background research:</strong> Key facts, recent updates, relevant data, policy, or history that shape the story.</li>\n<li><strong>Stakeholder map:</strong> The individuals, groups, or institutions affected by or involved in the story.</li>\n<li><strong>Primary sources:</strong></li>\n<li>Who they are</li>\n<li>Why they matter</li>\n<li>What perspectives or information you expect from them</li>\n<li>Evidence that you can access them (contact details, emails, phone calls, visit attempts, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Interview strategy:</strong></li>\n<li>Key questions or themes you intend to explore</li>\n<li>Anticipated lines of inquiry</li>\n<li>Any ethical considerations or sensitivities</li>\n<li><strong>Verification plan:</strong> How you intend to check claims, confirm facts, and address conflicting accounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Reporting plan:</strong> When and how you intend to complete interviews, gather multimedia elements, and produce your final story.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential risks/constraints:</strong> Access issues, legal considerations, safety concerns, or reporting obstacles you may need to navigate.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposed story structure (early draft):</strong> How you currently imagine your story unfolding, your likely lead, key moments, and narrative shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The brief must be written in professional, third-person voice. It is not part of the pitch and will be assessed as a separate component of Assessment 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI:</strong></p>\n<p> Students may use AI as part of their writing and planning process, but the brief must reflect your own research, reporting initiative, and editorial judgment. AI must not be used to create fictitious facts, sources, quotes, or events.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Each photograph must include a caption with accurate identification of people and relevant context. Captions are not included in the word count.</p>\n<p>You will also produce a 30–45 second <strong>video </strong>summary or a supporting angle of your story designed for social media distribution. This should be in a format appropriate for TikTok or Instagram Reels and should match the tone and style of your nominated outlet. The video does not need to feature the sources interviewed for the written story (but if appropriate and you've secured their consent, then it may include those sources); it may be a piece-to-camera or an edited visual explainer.
