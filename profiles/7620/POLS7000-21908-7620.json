The body of the paper should engage with relevant academic literature on different concepts of power and then apply them to illustrate what mechanisms, policies, decision or actions were used to exercise power, by whom and what effects it has had on social and political life in your case study. Overall, you should demonstrate that you have developed a good understanding of different concepts of power and are able to apply them to investigate how power works in politics. </p>\n<p>This assessment should be 1500 words in length (10% leeway is accepted). References will not be counted within the word limit. </p>\n<p>Refer to the Blackboard site for marking criteria and Turnitin submission link.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
