Only one group member needs to submit the file, but the submission must include the allocated food product and the names of all group members.</p>\n<p>Groups are <strong>self-selected</strong> and managed via Blackboard. Instructions on how to create or join a group in Blackboard will be provided in Week 1, and groups will be formed in <strong>Weeks 1–2</strong>. Students who do not have a group should use the Blackboard group tool and tutorial time to connect with others; teaching staff can assist with matching where possible. Students must be in a group by the end of <strong>Tutorial Session 2</strong>.
