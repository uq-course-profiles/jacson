Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge and ability to use SQL. The fundamental knowledge and skills required for this assessment task are expected to be cultivated through lectures and tutorials. However, students will need to conduct additional research to further enhance the skills necessary to complete this assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Team formation and teamwork: </strong>You will undertake this project as part of a team of 4-5.<strong> </strong>Project team members must be allocated to the same tutorial. You will submit portions of the project at intervals, receive oral comments on your work during the informal presentations from your tutor, and revise earlier submissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Iteration Session (Week 8): </strong>Students will submit selected sections of their project by the end of Week 8. During the week 9 tutorial, students receive oral comments on their work from their tutor. This iteration submission is for feedback only and is not graded.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Assessment: </strong>students will be required to complete a self and peer evaluation as part of this assignment. The evaluation process assists the teaching team in understanding how each student contributed and the findings are confidential. The peer evaluation can affect each student's mark for this assignment. A link will be provided on Blackboard for this evaluation. </p>\n<p><strong>Working effectively in a Team: </strong>A Practical Guide MOOC explores ways in which to learn how to build effective teams, be a great team player, and manage team conflict.
