            "submission_guidelines": "<p>The School of Architecture, Design and Planning uses Blackboard and Turnitin for assessment submission. Turnitin is accessed through the course Blackboard site. Turnitin also checks for plagiarism or instances where the original work of others is not appropriately acknowledged. Uploaded files must contain readable text and not be rasterised. Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission. To meet professional accreditation, public engagement and quality assurance obligations, digital copies of all course assessment items must be submitted in addition to any hard copy submission requirements specified in individual Course / Studio Outlines. Any physical models should be photographed and a minimum of two photographs describing the complete and full model must be included in the digital submission. </p>",

This framework will respond to the research developed through the semester and the design questions raised during the analysis phase. In the framework, you will present a compelling argument for <em>Relational Space</em> – a space that offers opportunity for actors to find agency. It will demonstrate how that space will evolve over time, interacting with the catchment’s environment and catalysing positive change throughout the networks. The work will be presented in a range of techniques and media including images, text, diagrams and mappings at various scales.</p>\n<p><strong>In-person assessment prohibits use of AI and/or MT: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
