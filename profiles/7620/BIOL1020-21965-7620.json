Students are required to be prepared for the practical, hence they are expected to read the relevant sections of the practical manual (posted on blackboard) and to complete a short set of pre-practical questions before coming to class. </p>\n<p>Additional questions and activities will occur during the regular scheduled practical time which will contribute marks to this assessment. Students must have their pre-practical questions checked off by their tutor upon arriving at the beginning of each practical session. All questions from practicals might also appear on the mini tests and final exam, so students are encouraged to make the best attempts possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Lab safety is a critical priority and is assessed as part of class participation. Students must follow all safety guidelines before entering each practical session. This practice contributes to working safely in the lab environment. </strong></p>\n<p>All practical components contribute to the overall mark for this assessment. The marking criteria will be provided by the course practical coordinator and are also available in the practical manual. If you have any questions, please contact Ms. Lois Eden.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task.
