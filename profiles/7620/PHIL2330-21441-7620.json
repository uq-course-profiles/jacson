The participation assessment encourages students to attend regularly; engage in active Socratic thinking; stay current with lecture and reading content; and promote academic integrity in assessment. Its purposes also include helping students learn how to think philosophically (philosophy is not, like many disciplines, mainly about learning content but rather more about developing reasoning skills).</p>\n<p>Please see below for criteria associated with participation and quizzes. Guidance for preparation and meeting criteria for participation activities will be available on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Allowance is built into the design of the participation mark for students to miss, without penalty, up to two of the scheduled lectures/tutorials for reasons not recognized by the university as acceptable exemptions from assessment (e.g. medical grounds or where there are exceptional circumstances - <a href=\"http://www.uq.edu.au/myadvisor/index.html?page=2995\">http://www.uq.edu.au/myadvisor/index.html?page=2995</a> ). You only need to contact the lecturer if you are absent from a class in cases where you will be applying for one of the University acceptable exemptions to assessment.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

In your essay you must critically engage with and evaluate arguments rather than just explain them and you must critically evaluate at least one objection to your argument.</p>\n<p>It is important at the beginning of your essay that you clearly set out the focus and scope of your argument. As you go along, it is often advantageous to flag some relevant arguments/claims that you are not going to address in detail.</p>\n<p>If the focus of the essay you are intending to write has some distance from the material we have covered in class then please consult the tutor or lecturer to get prior approval before starting to write your essay.</p>\n<p>There is an option to do the essay with one or two other students in the course. This is only an option - adopting this option is done solely via private voluntary arrangements between students. Group work is not a required part of the course and is not taught in this course. This option though gives students the opportunity to work collaboratively on their essays if they wish to. Students who choose to submit an essay jointly will receive an identical mark for the jointly submitted essay. The essay length will be 2100 words if two students are submitting, and 2400 words if three students are submitting.</p>\n<p>The name of the electronic file for your assignment and the title you submit through Blackboard should be the topic number and then your name (or names, if in a group), i.e. “Topic 2, Joe Blogs”. The actual wording of the question should not be typed on your assignment (these are simple requirements and if you do not comply with it you will lose a mark)</p>\n<p>Make sure you check, via your word processor program the word count of your paper to ensure it is within the required word limit (quotations and substantive footnotes count towards the word limit, bibliographies, in text references, titles or subtitles do not). Students need to provide their word count on their essay cover sheet.</p>\n<p>The assignments are designed so that you can demonstrate your understanding of the subject material, your analytical ability to reflect critically and evaluate the substantive arguments contained in the readings and lectures. A detailed guide for philosophy assignment preparation will be made available on the Blackboard site for this course. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with School policy regarding academic advice, assessment, plagiarism, etc. </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Although students are permitted to use AI, they must complete an acknowledgement statement which will be available on the Blackboard online teaching page, and must comply with acknowledgement guidelines.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
