The series focuses on four areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognising and Caring for the Acutely Unwell Patient (Acutely Unwell Patient)</li>\n<li>Safe Prescribing</li>\n<li>Ward call - Clinical Investigations (Ward Call)</li>\n<li>Multimorbidity and Whole Person care (Multimorbidity)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each learning series consist of 6 learning units. Four units will include a face-to-face tutorial component; two units will include fully online interactive scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>General Practice and Critical Care Plus Immersions:</strong></p>\n<p>The learning unit will include an <strong>on-line preparatory component</strong> followed by <strong>application of learning in face-to-face tutorials</strong>. Please do not underestimate the value of small group learning - you will learn by working through scenarios and by questions asked by your peers and clinical tutors. You will apply your learning by responding to clinical scenarios and completing intern tasks. Consideration of community and hospital-based scenarios, rural and metropolitan scenarios will occur throughout the program. Students undertaking their General Practice term in a rural location (GPiRL) will undertake the LLP tutorials using Zoom and remote learning and simulation techniques facilitated by rural generalists as well as participate in face-to- face learning opportunities. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Extension Immersion:</strong></p>\n<p>The learning units will include an <strong>on-line preparatory component</strong> followed by an <strong>online application-of-learning component</strong> which will involve you responding to clinical scenarios, questions and/or tasks. You will receive feedback following your attempts through answers, explanations and best practice exemplars of task completion. You may wish to connect with your peers online in small study groups, to discuss the online modules.

To improve the safety and effectiveness of your prescribing as an intern and to meet the requirements of the MEDI7400 course it is mandatory that you participate in the <em>Prescribing Skills Assessment</em>. In addition to prescribing resources in your year 3 and 4 clinical immersions and the year 4 Longitudinal Learning Program, a suite of PSA modules will support your success in this assessment. The modules are divided into three sections: Prescribing Skills, Clinical Pharmacology and PSA Preparation. It is imperative that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>complete the PSA preparation modules</strong> as these will help you understand how the exam is constructed and the different types of questions you will be expected to answer.</li>\n<li>engage with the <strong>practice exams</strong> early and repeatedly - the exam is moderately paced to reflect prescribing and decision-making in clinical environments</li>\n<li><strong>know how to use the Australian Medicines Handbook</strong> and <strong>Therapeutic Guidelines </strong></li>\n<li><strong>You may choose how you wish to engage</strong> with the PSA Prescribing Skills modules and PSA Clinical Pharmacology modules based on your learning elsewhere. You may cover topics adequately in your learning on clinical placement and only need to engage with the modules as required. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>PSA modules: You may use these modules to supplement your learning in your clinical immersion terms and safe prescribing series in the Longitudinal Learning Program as needed.</p>\n<p>Clinical Pharmacology modules: Cover important clinical pharmacology to inform safe prescribing. These modules reinforce year 3 clinical pharmacology modules. You may use these to supplement your learning as needed.</p>\n<p>The PSA consists of 8 sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prescribing</li>\n<li>Prescription review</li>\n<li>Planning Management</li>\n<li>Communicating information</li>\n<li>Calculation skills</li>\n<li>Adverse drug reactions</li>\n<li>Drug monitoring</li>\n<li>Data interpretation</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking: </strong></p>\n<p>All questions in the practice papers and in the final exam will have been reviewed and edited by representatives from Australian medical schools. Using a modified Angoff process the final exam paper is set to an Australasian standard.</p>\n<p>Engagement with the PSA is an important part of the Professionalism and Leadership component in year 4. To satisfy the requirements of the MEDI71400 course you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Complete the two 30-item PSA Practice tests</strong> in your own time to score a <strong>minimum of 80%</strong> (feedback provided and multiple attempts allowed).</li>\n<li><strong>Sit at least one of the two scheduled timed 60-item PSA practice assessments</strong> either Friday 12 June 8.00am AEST and/or Friday 7 August 8.00am AEST. Students should review their results and identify areas needing further attention prior to the PSA exam.</li>\n<li><strong>Complete the PSA exam</strong>. In 2026 this will be a participation hurdle, however, due to the relevance of this exam and your safety and effectiveness as an intern it is expected that students will aim to achieve well in this examination. The main sitting will be Wednesday 16 September 8.00am AEST.</li>\n<li><strong>Review your performance on the PSA exam</strong>, identify deficiencies and demonstrate how you have addressed any knowledge gaps in your Professional Development Portfolio.</li>\n<li>Students who perform below the passing standard for the exam will review their deficiencies and how they have addressed these with the medical program lead Clinical Pharmacology and Safe prescribing to ensure these deficiencies are addressed adequately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment contributes to the waypoints, review panel and progression decision committee (Progression to PRINT Decision and the review of your performance on the PSA exam contributes to the Graduation decision) - refer to Learn.UQ.</p>\n<p>Further information on the PSA and its contribution to the progression decision at the end of the year can be found in the MEDI7400 Course Guide on <a href=\"https://learn.uq.edu.au/ultra/courses/_198915_1/outline\">Learn.UQ</a> .</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
