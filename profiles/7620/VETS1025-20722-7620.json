For students unable to observe live animals or the same live animals concurrently, video recording can be utilised if owner consent is acquired. This task has seven components;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Observe animals in their natural environment, from a distance which will not impact their natural behaviour. This should be done in your assignment group. </li>\n<li>Prepare a map of the area under observation, and estimate the size of the area, number of animals, class and species, and indicate their location on the map.</li>\n<li>Name and define at least fifteen (15) natural behaviours you observe.</li>\n<li>Create a table and describe, define and name these behaviours and record how many times you observe them to occur over a one hour period. For optimum marks these should be recorded as columns per individual, with identifying features of each individual animal noted at the top.</li>\n<li>Research journal articles where observed behaviours have been reported. Each group member should provide at least one article and contributions should be noted in the bibliography. Course behaviour notes and texts should also be reviewed.</li>\n<li>Discuss what was observed and any interpretations of these in light of the group's research and general experience. </li>\n<li>Prepare a report of this observation for submission, structured as research journal article. Exemplar's are provided on Blackboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Specific details</strong></p>\n<p>Assignment sheet, an exemplar assignment and marking rubric will be provided via Blackboard. An introductory behaviour observation lecture and practical classes will be run in Semester 1 to prepare students for this type of observation and reporting.</p>\n<p>This assignment will be completed in assigned groups of 3, 4 or 5, during Semester 2 and submitted via turnitin, in the assessments folder on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The minimum mark required for <strong>EACH </strong>of the specific species of animal handling practical assessments is <strong>70%</strong>, and <strong>ALL species exams MUST be passed to pass the course</strong>. The course Blackboard site lists the possible examinable competencies, all of which will be taught in the Semester 1 or 2 animal handling practical classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical 'Animal Handling' Exams Failure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Students who do not achieve a 70% pass mark in any of the animal handling practical assessment or receive a 'Safety fail' may be eligible for a second attempt at achieving competency</strong>. Students will only be eligible for second attempt at achieving competency if they have attended the failed species' animal handling practical class taught during the semester.</p>\n<p>If a second attempt at achieving competency is awarded for dogs and/or horses, students will be required to undertake retraining in the species they failed, immediately prior to the <strong>second attempt at achieving competency, in Week 10 of Semester 2</strong>. Any student who cannot attend the Week 10 scheduled date for their second attempt at competency, without a medical certificate, will forfeit their 2nd attempt at competency, and enter the supplementary exam pathway for the course, if eligible under UQ <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=184\">Assessment Procedures</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Campus biosecurity requires all students to be in Australia for 7 days prior entering any animal facility on campus, therefore it is essential that students do not book international travel during the Semester 2 mid-semester break. </strong>Therefore NO student will be allowed to undertake a second attempt at competency if they have returned from overseas less than SEVEN (7) days prior to the scheduled exam. Failure to satisfy the biosecurity requirement will automatically result in cancellation of the second attempt leading to supplementary assessment if the student is eligible.</p>\n<p>Students who are not eligible for, or who fail their second attempt at achieving competency in any species, may be eligible for supplementary assessment under UQ <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=184\">Assessment Procedures</a>. <strong>Supplementary assessment, will be scheduled in the Semester 2 Deferred and Supplementary Examination period.</strong> </p>\n<p>In the event of timetabled face-to-face animal handling practical exams being postponed due to adverse weather or other confounding reasons, the exams will be rescheduled as soon as practically possible. There is no suitable alternative format for these exams as they assess animal handling competencies that are critical in demonstrating that students are safe to progress in the BVSc(Hons) program.</p>\n<p>If the animal handling practical exams cannot be held before the finalisation of grades, students will be awarded an incomplete (INC) grade in VETS1025 until the examinations can be rescheduled.</p>\n<p><strong>All Practical 'Animal Handling' assessment will be held on the Gatton Campus ONLY</strong>.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
