Explain how literacy and numeracy strategies will be incorporated and developed within your unit. You need to provide specific examples of activities or strategies used.</p>\n<p>9. Provide an assessment task and criteria for the unit that reflects the requirements of the curriculum document. Demonstrate your understanding of assessment strategies by describing how you will use a range of approaches throughout the unit (e.g. informal, formal, diagnostic, formative, summative) to assess student learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Count:</strong> 1500-2000 which does not include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Item 1 - Unit plan grid overview</li>\n<li>Item 3 - 3 x lesson plans with associated resources</li>\n<li>Item 8 - Assessment Task</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
