            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Data visualisations and infographics are powerful tools for communicating complex information that text and tables cannot easily explain. These visual approaches reveal hidden patterns, explain difficult processes, and provide instructions that enhance a reader’s understanding.</p>\n<p>Today, information graphics are essential across many fields, including scientific visualisation, product design, business, and information technology. In any setting, these tools provide more meaningful outcomes by making data accessible.</p>\n<p>Designing <em>data stories</em> is more than just a visual translation. It requires filtering information, discovering relationships between data sets, and presenting those findings in a way that is clear and impactful.</p>\n<p>In this project, students will design and produce an A2 (594mm x 420mm) poster to communicate their chosen topic. To succeed, posters will need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Construct &amp; present a clear narrative:</strong> use a central dataset and supporting research to tell a clear, structured story about the data.</li>\n<li><strong>Show the complexity in the data:</strong> Create <em>at least one </em>advanced visualisation showing multiple data relationships (multidimensional).</li>\n<li><strong>Build a cohesive story:</strong> Support your narrative with a series of simpler visualisations to create a unified, professional presentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will present your work to the teaching team and your peers in a compulsory &amp; identity-verified critique process. The key aim of the critique process is to establish design defensibility - i.e. \"if you made it, you should be able to defend it\"; and to verify the authorship of the work. </p>\n<p>There are 2 formal critiques for this assessment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interim Critique in Week 9 practical sessions </strong>- in this critique, you will present a copy of your poster-in-progress, printed onto A3 (297mm x 420mm) paper. The aim of this critique is to understand design decisions made and to provide feedback for you to improve your poster before final submission. More details about this critique can be found in the <em>Data Visualisation Poster: Interim Critique</em> assessment item.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Critique in Week 11 practical sessions</strong> - in this critique, you will present a professionally printed copy of the final poster at A2 (420mm x 594mm) size. The aim of this critique is to understand the evolution of the poster design and the design decisions you made in presenting the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both critiques, you will be asked to describe your design decisions, such as why you chose your specific story structure and why you used specific visualisations or encodings. You will also be asked about how the design has evolved from early concepts and how design theory has been applied to visualising the data in poster form.
