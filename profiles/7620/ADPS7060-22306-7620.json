You will clearly articulate a relevant research problem and research question(s), and propose a coherent and feasible research plan. You will critically analyse and annotate relevant literature and/or creative works. Emphasis is placed on disciplinary-appropriate written and visual communication, as well as early ethical awareness, including reflective consideration of research tools and AI.</p>\n<p>The assessment requires students to position their proposed thesis within an appropriate disciplinary context, to identify a relevant research problem, articulate the research intent, scope, and direction. Students may pursue either:</p>\n<p>·      a <strong>research-based thesis</strong>, in which findings are generated through data collection and analysis, or</p>\n<p>·      a <strong>research-led design thesis</strong>, in which evidence informs iterative design exploration and reflective practice.</p>\n<p> Both approaches must demonstrate scholarly rigour, critical judgement, and clarity of intent.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
