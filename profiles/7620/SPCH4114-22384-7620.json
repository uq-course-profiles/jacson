A complex case is defined as one in which multiple factors influence speech pathology assessment and management, rather than a single, straightforward issue (e.g. 4 year old child with 2-3 sounds in error). An example of a complex case could be a patient experiencing dysarthria and dysphagia, plus depression and impaired mobility; management may have required a complex multidisciplinary approach; or perhaps there are additional social or psychosocial issues that made management complex and required you to do something different in order to optimise treatment for this child/adult (e.g., family issues, service issues, resource difficulties). There are no set criteria for determining what represents a complex case however, simple or rapidly resolving cases are not suitable. Your chosen case should allow you to demonstrate clinical reasoning, problem‑solving, and professional decision‑making in the context of complexity for your patient.</p>\n<p>All students must play a role in developing the presentation, and in presenting on the day. There will be 10 minutes for questions, and responses to questions will contribute to the mark received.</p>\n<p>The marking criteria are available on Blackboard and<strong> </strong>should be used to help structure the presentation.</p>\n<p>When a student is required to complete an oral or practical assessment item worth 20% or more, the performance will be recorded and retained per Appendix 1.<a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=184\"> (Assessment Procedure (95))</a> </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
