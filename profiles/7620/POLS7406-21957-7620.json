Since only the top 8 quizzes out of 10 count towards the final mark, allowing students to miss two classes without compromising their final grade, I will not provide alternative assessment unless under exceptional, and well-evidenced circumstances.</p>\n<p>The quiz will consist of two question, each worth 2 points. The first will ask you to briefly define a key concept, based on one of the required readings. You will be assessed on the accuracy of your definition, based on the particular text. The second question will test your understanding of how the same concept is being used by the author(s) in the text. You will be assessed on how accurately you have used the concept, in line with its usage in the text. No half points will be given, so a score of 2 indicates a mostly or very accurate response to a question, 1 is partly accurate, and 0 is mostly or wholly inaccurate.</p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
