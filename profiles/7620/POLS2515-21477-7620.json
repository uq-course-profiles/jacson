In this part, you should participate actively in tutorial discussions.</p>\n<p>You will receive 2 marks for participating in each tutorial, in which you are expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the required reading materials before tutorials and be prepared to engage with discussion questions.</li>\n<li>Express your own ideas about the content.</li>\n<li>Show an interest in others’ thoughts and contribute to their development or offer counterarguments.</li>\n<li>Ask questions for clarification or elaboration.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the content covered in lectures and tutorials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are unable to attend a tutorial due to extraordinary circumstances, you may have the opportunity to make up the missed mark by submitting a short review of two required readings for that week. You must discuss this with the course coordinator first and then submit the review to your tutor by Friday of the following week. Ongoing work or study commitments are not considered valid reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Learning reflection (4 marks)</strong></p>\n<p>The second part of this assessment consists of a written learning reflection, due on Friday 24 April (Week 8).</p>\n<p><strong>Word length:</strong> Maximum 350 words.</p>\n<p>In the reflective piece, you should focus on what you learned about the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in peace and conflict studies. This should be based on readings and tutorial and seminar discussions from Week 7.</p>\n<p>Citations and references are not required, but you may include a small number if they help support your reflections. You may write in the first-person language.</p>\n<p>The reflections will not be formally assessed, and no feedback will be provided, but they will be checked to ensure you have completed the exercise and are eligible to receive the mark. A very short reflection (for example, less than 100 words) will receive a mark of 0.</p>\n<p>This part of the assessment must be submitted via Turnitin.
