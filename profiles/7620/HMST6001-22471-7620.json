For a 12 unit thesis, you should be spending approximately 720 hours of the year undertaking your research. This equates to approximately 240 hours in the first semester (if you have also undertaken 4 units in other courses) and 480 hours in the second semester (almost 40 hours per week). </p>\n<p>Please submit your research plan to the course coordinator with your supervisor(s) included on the email.</p>\n<p>Please include the following information.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Details - </strong>Student name, adviser name/s, project title.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Rationale -</strong> An outline of the purpose of the project and the aims of the research. Include key references. Maximum one page.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Methods </strong>- Describe the methods of your research (e.g., study design, participants, outcomes measures, statistical analysis). Maximum one page.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Timeline </strong>- A full timeline including time devoted to developing the project, literature search and background writing, upskilling/training, ethics, data collection, data analysis, thesis writing (including drafts submission) should be provided, along with any resource requirements (e.g., equipment; statistical packages). This should satisfy the coordinator that the project is neither too big nor too small for the requirements of the course. Maximum one page.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationship with HMST4925 project: </strong>HMST4925 is designed as a companion course for HMST6001. Students should build on the work and learnings done in HMST4925 for their broader Honours thesis, noting that both need to be distinct pieces of work. Describe how the proposed project is related to the project proposed in HMST4925.
