Practical tasks following mini-lectures: As a tutor-led task following mini-lecture 1 , preservice teachers develop learning objectives for lesson sequences and task introductions with well-defined goals (CC 2.2.2 – practised). After mini-lecture 2 , preservice teachers engage in a recall task (CC 2.2.5 – practised). After mini-lecture 3 , preservice teachers incorporate spacing and retrieval practices into a lesson or sequence (CC 2.1.2 – practised). After mini-lecture 4 , preservice teachers observe tutor modelling of subject-specific worked examples, and design shrot tasks for students who are unfamiliar with a curriculum concept (CC 1.3.3, 2.2.4 – practiced).
