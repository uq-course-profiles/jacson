Evaluate the available evidence regarding their ability to distinguish fictional AI content from real content and the extent to which this has the potential to impact their development. Use published research to support any arguments you construct and use this research to provide clear recommendations for how to approach this issue. </p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong>: The purpose of this piece of assessment is to allow you to demonstrate your ability to explain a contemporary developmental issue, find relevant empirical research, critically evaluate evidence and formulate a convincing argument. When writing your essay, you must introduce two academic perspectives that are based on research. You will then incorporate additional studies to support the arguments of each. Finally, you will discuss your own conclusion about whether you consider the evidence to be adequate enough to support clear recommendations.</p>\n<p>The essay is to be written in APA format with a word length of 2000 words excluding references. You must include a title and a reference list with all (and only) cited references noted. No abstract is required. Although this assessment piece will be discussed in general terms in your tutorial classes, the essay assesses your ability to work independently. Thus, you should use your library skills to locate relevant material independently. There are many different approaches possible and you will need to research some possible angles and then narrow your focus. Studies that are mentioned in lectures will be a good starting point, but keep in mind that you cannot use the articles provided as starter readings on Blackboard as your main research articles. To ensure that you do not go overboard with reading, you must limit your reference list to a maximum of 12 references. It is better to have a thorough discussion of a few major issues than to include too many different issues and end up with a superficial discussion. Your understanding, critical thinking, and ability to communicate key issues will be assessed, as well as your integration of the literature. General essay marking criteria and guidelines are provided. The guidelines will be discussed extensively in several of your tutorials.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
