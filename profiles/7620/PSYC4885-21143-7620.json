Each student will deliver an individual 10-15 min presentation that focuses on one key empirical paper relevant to the group’s shared research question. Students should explain the theoretical background, methods, and findings of their selected paper, and critically evaluate at least one important limitation. Students are encouraged to select papers that differ in theoretical approach, methodology or population (where appropriate) to support meaningful synthesis at the group level. Potential papers will be provided but students will also have the option to source their own papers if they wish. While each student will only present one paper, it will be important that they read widely to ensure they have a strong knowledge of the research area to facilitate the structured class activity (described next). </p>\n<p>Following the presentations, the group will facilitate a structured class activity where the class will work in small groups to identify a key limitation of the presented studies and collaboratively design a research study to address this limitation. The activity will conclude with a whole-class discussion reflecting on the proposed designs and their implications.</p>\n<p>The oral presentation mark consists of an individual component worth 30% and a group component worth 10% (40% in total). The individual component assesses each student’s ability to explain theory, evaluate empirical evidence, and critically analyse a selected research paper. The group component assesses how effectively the group integrates individual presentations, synthesises key limitations in the literature, and facilitates the study-design activity. </p>\n<p>Other notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are required to email a PDF copy of your Presentation to the Course Coordinator at least 2 hours prior to your presentation delivery date/time.</li>\n<li>In addition, the Course Coordinator will record the oral presentations per University policy that any live oral assessment item worth 20% or more must be recorded and retained as the official recording of the item for re-mark purposes (if required).</li>\n<li>Marking criteria will be made available on Blackboard and discussed in Week 2. </li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
