You should be able to draw on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and their similarities and differences. You should also be able to exemplify how an aspect of these interventions can be applied based on your clinical practice, and lastly, you should lead a discussion with the tutorial group to expand on issues identified during your presentation and connect the topic with other students' practice. You can use PowerPoint slides to support your presentation.</p>\n<p>At the start of the semester the tutor will determine with the students the roster of presentations for the semester based on the list of tutorial topics. Students might seek support from tutors or course coordinator for the preparation of their presentation.</p>\n<p>During your presentation you should:</p>\n<p>a) Define one complex clinical problem or non-traditional clinical population, including characteristics, history and research finding about prevalence, burden of illness, etc.</p>\n<p>b) Critically discuss two contending perspectives/therapeutic interventions for this clinical problem or clinical population, drawing on strengths and weaknesses, similarities and differences.</p>\n<p>c) Reflect on how these therapeutic interventions might or not be applicable to your current practice.</p>\n<p>d) Leads tutorial session, fostering engagement and active participation of tutorial group in the discussion of the topic. </p>\n<p>e) Present a clear, well organised and visually appealing presentation (you might use PowerPoint slides), with a suggested time distribution of 15-20 minutes for the presentation and 10-15 minutes for leading a discussion with the group.
