Your task is to develop a 2500-word research proposal that adheres to the guidelines and standards of the American Psychological Association (APA) style, 7th Edition. This proposal should present a well-structured rationale based on a literature review, outline your proposed study, make predictions, and include a reference list (which is not included in the word count). Additionally, you should create a budget for the study, with a maximum (realistic) budget allocation of AUD$3500. NOTE: You will provide a 3-minute video overview of your proposal during Week 9, and you will be provided feedback about your project based on that. Your final written proposal should show evidence that you have taken this feedback on board.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
