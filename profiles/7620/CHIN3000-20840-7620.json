To ensure appropriate and ethical use of AI tools, students must submit (1 ) a video or screen recording of their interaction and (2) a written record or transcript of the ChatGPT conversation to Blackboard/Ultra. These submissions are due at 1pm every Monday, starting from Week 3 (except in Week 10 - Due to the Monday Public Holiday,  the recording will be due 1pm Tuesday). A demonstration is provided during the Wednesday Tutorial in Week 1.</p>\n<p><strong> 2.Teacher Feedback:</strong> The teacher will provide general feedback on both the students' spoken Chinese and ChatGPT’s output, and specific feedback to any individual student can be provided on request.</p>\n<p><strong> 3.Critical Reflection:</strong> Students will write a reflection evaluating their experience with ChatGPT-assisted speaking practice, including a critical consideration of AI’s strengths and limitations and potential ways AI could be used in future language-learning contexts.
