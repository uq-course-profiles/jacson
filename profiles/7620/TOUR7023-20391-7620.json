You will need to complete all three components (Part A, B and C) to receive a mark for this assessment task. </p>\n<p>For this assessment task, you need to appraise a tourism destination. </p>\n<p><strong>Prospective destinations</strong> </p>\n<p>You MUST select one of the Queensland destinations from the list provided on Blackboard. The destination will represent your client for the task. There are a limited number of representatives per destination available, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Once available, you must confirm your selected destination through the Blackboard sign on form.  </p>\n<p><strong>Submission Format: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part A Destination Audit Spreadsheet - 30%</strong></p>\n<p>You are to conduct an external resource audit of the chosen destination from the listed choices and critically evaluate all the relevant natural, cultural and support resources. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A spreadsheet template is available on Blackboard to guide the audit process. </li>\n<li>You have to identify relevant resources that reflect <strong>your destination characteristics</strong>. The audit must cover all resource sub-types (five natural, four cultural, four support) and include at least one resource for each type. The identified resources must reflect the destination, thus allowing for more natural or cultural resources depending on the type of destination. </li>\n<li>You are to critically evaluate each resource's appeal, quality, and uniqueness. </li>\n<li>You then identify and reflect on the main management challenges and possible strategies to overcome those challenges. </li>\n<li>Your completed spreadsheet must be submitted in Week 6 and constitutes Part A of this assessment. Completion of the spreadsheet provides the foundation for you to complete Part B.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part B Infographic - 20%</strong></p>\n<p>Based on your research and resource audit spreadsheet, you will prepare an infographic (using Canva’s or Piktochart 's Infographic free function, or similar) from a destination marketing perspective. An infographic is a visual representation of an idea or data, and yours should be succinct, entertaining, and eye-catching. It should cite the relevant literature and incorporate informative text and engaging images or graphics to appeal and explain your findings to your audiences. (<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">https://www.canva.com/</a>) (<a href=\"https://create.piktochart.com/infographic\">https://create.piktochart.com/infographic</a>). Your infographic should address the following aspects: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An overview of the destination (geographical location, types of attractions, visitor segment and statistics etc) </li>\n<li>A summary of the most relevant two (2) examples of natural, cultural and support resources available at this destination. This will require you to inform on each of your selected resources in terms of: i) quality, ii) uniqueness and iii) appeal (i.e. 2 x natural resources, 2 x cultural resources and 2 x support resources); and</li>\n<li>Explain the most important two (2) resource management challenges for your destination. Evidence-based justification of the identified challenges is necessary. </li>\n<li>Address each challenge strategically with one (1) possible management strategy that will overcome the challenge. The infographic therefore will include two (2) strategies, one for each of the most important challenges. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your research should be based on recent academic sources (published within the past 10 years). Attach your reference list following the APA reference guide on the audit and the infographic. </p>\n<p><strong>Part C Destination Forum Panel Discussion </strong> </p>\n<p>Following your Audit and Infographic submission, you will participate in a Destination Forum Panel Discussion. Each panel will consist of students from different regional destinations. The panel discussion is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of your work by justifying your decisions and engaging with different perspectives from your peers.  </p>\n<p>You will need to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a brief (1 minute) verbal overview of your infographic: summarize the key resources for tourism development and key markets. </li>\n<li>Engage in a facilitated discussion with your group responding to questions from peers and the facilitator on various topics such as destination management and competitiveness, markets, management challenges and solutions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Confirmation of Assessment Integrity (Compulsory)</strong></p>\n<p>Assessment 1 is a secure assessment task. The Destination Forum Panel Discussion (Part C) is a compulsory in-person task designed to verify that you can demonstrate you have achieved the learning outcomes for Assessment 1. You must pass Part C to be eligible to pass the Part A Audit. If you cannot demonstrate a passing standard to verify your work and meet the learning outcomes, you will receive a mark of 0 for Part A. Refer to the Assessment Task Description for further information.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> The panel discussions will be recorded as per UQ Policy.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI in Assessment </strong></p>\n<p>The Destination Forum Panel Discussion (Part C) is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted in this component of the assessment. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>You may use AI to support the preparation of your Audit (Part A) and Infographic (Part B). Students using AI must disclose one AI Statement and attach an Appendix with the prompts given to AI and the results provided by AI. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
