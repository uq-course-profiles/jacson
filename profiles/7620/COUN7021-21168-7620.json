Guidance notes are provided in Appendix 9 of the Practice Education Manual.</p>\n<p>For you to become a reflective practitioner who can integrate knowledge and evidence-based practice, practice-based knowledge and understanding is a central objective of the placement courses. Use your learning journal to explore ideas and to reflect on your experiences. Seek out research papers and books to build your knowledge of counselling theory, skills and counselling issues. Include other pertinent literature such as, how to make the best use of supervision, or link your learning on practice to recommended reading from other current or previous courses you may be studying, on matters such as, mental health, health capacity challenges, loss, ethics, children and young people, relationship counselling, crisis and violence. It is good practice to inform yourself about issues relevant to your clients’ well-being and your possible interventions to improve or maintain it. All practicing counsellors need to keep informed of relevant and current literature and ideas relating to counselling practice. The Journal offers you a framework to develop the capacity to remain current.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> the Learning Journal will <strong><em>not </em></strong>be read by anyone else but yourself. It will be sighted at three points during the placement - at the placement visit (six weeks into placement), the formative evaluation of practice (end of Semester 1), and the summative evaluation of practice (end of Semester 2). Again, at these points, you supervisor will just need to sight that you have been completing the journal, but will not read the content. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The Master of Counselling program uses the assessment process of the Core Competency Interviews to assess this competence. This practical assessment item involves the students undertaking an observed and assessed live interview/counselling session with a “client”. This reflective process will determine whether a student has sufficient counselling skills and ability to commence client work in the practicum (COUN7021).</p>\n<p><strong>For students who have successful passed their competency interview in COUN7006 in the semester prior to commencing placement</strong> (i.e. Semester 2, 2025), this will be deemed as evidence of current competency.</p>\n<p>For students who have <strong>not</strong> completed COUN7006 in the semester prior to placement, they will need to have university staff ensure that they have current competence on starting placement. This will follow the format of the Core Competency Interview:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be expected to undertake a 30-40 minute counselling session/interview with an informed volunteer as your client. The volunteer clients will be organised for you so that you do not need to find your own clients.</li>\n<li>You are to approach the session as the initial interview with the client.</li>\n<li>The interview will be being viewed by at least one MCouns academic and/or professional staff member who will act as a reflective team for you and who will complete your assessment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The feedback from this assessment item should be taken as a reflection of your current learning needs as a counselling professional, and therefore will frame your learning agenda as you enter placement. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
