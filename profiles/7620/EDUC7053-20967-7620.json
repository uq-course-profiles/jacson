Each week you may like to spend 10 minutes after lecture to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What was the most important thing/concept/idea you learned during the lecture?</li>\n<li>What was something you already knew or had learned but it was reinforced?</li>\n<li>What are your beliefs about teaching and learning in global contexts? Has your belief changed because of the way you have been taught to think critically? Or do you still have the same belief about teaching/learning?</li>\n<li>What are the implications of learning of this important concept/idea for your future role as educator?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please summarise your reflection and consider how you may be able to apply what we learn in class to your career and/or to your other subjects in the Master of Educational Studies.</p>\n<p>There is no need to write answers to each of the questions.

They are drawn from the central ideas, debates, and issues explored in course readings, lectures, and learning activities. You will be given a pool of topics, and one will be allocated to you during the workshop.</p>\n<p>Your presentation must take a clear position and use a persuasive, argumentative tone. To prepare effectively, ensure your presentation includes:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce the topic and outline the main debates or issues that shape your argument.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.

Reflection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reflect on your experience preparing the presentation, including any challenges you encountered and the benefits gained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7. Implications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discuss any theoretical and/or pedagogical implications that arise from your argument.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each presentation will be 20 minutes long. From this, 5 minutes will be reserved for questions from the audience and/or tutor. Presentations will be delivered live: in class for on-campus students and online for external students. Recorded presentations will not be accepted. You may use PowerPoint slides. Presentations longer than 23 minutes may be penalised.</p>\n<p>Presentations will begin in Week 3. All presentations will be recorded for assessment purposes.
