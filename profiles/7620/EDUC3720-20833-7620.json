To develop deep conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts, it is often essential to design a series of lessons to provide opportunity for students to develop scope and depth of the content area.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Task</strong>: In this task, you will individually develop a coherent and deliberate plan of sequenced lessons (three lessons), using knowledge of effective student learning, content and teaching strategies for the Primary Years (P-6).</p>\n<p>You will select and use strategies to meet specific learning goals, including curriculum-aligned learning objectives, clear descriptions of how students will show evidence of mastery, the common progression of learning in a subject area and the critical curriculum knowledge needed for students to progress. In addition, you will demonstrate how you will build awareness of forms of diversity, and plan individual and small group learning tasks to cater for diverse needs. The lessons will demonstrate creativity and initiative (CC 2.1.1 – practised).</p>\n<p>You will then use curriculum, assessment and reporting knowledge and research literature to justify your decisions by completing a rationale. The rationale will be assessed according to critical engagement with relevant literature. To model planning experiences for work in future schools, you may choose to work in pairs for the planning part of this assignment. However, you are required to complete the rationale individually. The year level and topic focus for this planning sequence is to be chosen by you and/or your partner.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In this task, students will develop a sequence of three lessons for engaging students in mathematics. The lesson plans will include a literature-informed rationale that justifies the lesson; highlights the importance of its content and processes for mathematical learning; outlines and justifies the pedagogical approaches, and details the epistemological theoretical framework.</p>\n<p>Through this task, students will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>communicate learning goals</li>\n<li>establish learning goals and learning plans</li>\n<li>plan and evaluate learning experiences</li>\n<li>build awareness of policy and procedures</li>\n<li>select and use strategies to meet specific learning goals</li>\n<li>build awareness of the socially, culturally, and historically constructed nature of knowledge</li>\n<li>plan individual and small group sequenced learning tasks that increase in challenge and cater to diverse needs</li>\n<li>identify a range of teaching strategies for promoting numeracy</li>\n<li>consider the impact of ICT upon numeracy development</li>\n<li>plan small group learning tasks</li>\n<li>build knowledge of evidence-informed theories on mathematics teaching and learning, including evidence-based pedagogical approaches</li>\n<li>demonstrate understanding of the characteristics and needs of students in the primary school phase of learning plan and monitor group work; and</li>\n<li>cater for a range of learning approaches in planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment should follow this format:</p>\n<p><strong>THE LESSON PLAN</strong></p>\n<p>•\tIntroduce the year level and the chosen topic (a few sentences)</p>\n<p>•\tComplete a lesson sequence plan using an agreed format including the following elements.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Plan for effective learning and teaching. Ensure your plan:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Addresses the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics content descriptor/s for an effective mathematics learning and teaching sequence </li>\n<li>Demonstrates a variety of teaching strategies and activities including some individual and group work</li>\n<li>Notes possible cross-curricular links for numeracy development based on the chosen topic</li>\n<li>Demonstrates knowledge of a range of resources including ICT that engage students in their learning. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Know the content and how to teach it. Ensure your plan:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrates knowledge and understanding of the concepts, substance and structure of the content and effective teaching strategies of the teaching area</li>\n<li>Demonstrate knowledge and skill of an effective learning and teaching sequence, that incorporates spacing and retrieval practice, building upon each other, to meet students where they are in their learning and help students retrieve past learning and consolidate it in long-term memory (CC 2.1.2 – practised)</li>\n<li>Uses curriculum, assessment and reporting knowledge to design learning sequences and lesson plans</li>\n<li>Includes in your teaching strategies ICT applications that expand learning opportunities for students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>3. Know students and how they learn, and how to support inclusive participation. Ensure your plan:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sequences tasks within a lesson that build upon each other, meet students where they are in their learning and help them understand the progression of skills needed to attain mastery (CC 2.1.3 – practised).</li>\n<li>Demonstrates knowledge of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet three (choose 3) specific learning needs of students </li>\n<li>Identifies strategies to support inclusive participation and engagement in classroom activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Assess student learning</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Includes formative assessments with success criteria for feedback that would allow for consistent and comparable judgements of student learning within the class and across year level cohorts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE RATIONALE</strong></p>\n<p>In your planning, you had to make many professional decisions. In this section, you must demonstrate research informed knowledge and understanding of how your decisions help students learn and the implications for teaching. Take the important aspects of your plan and use them as subheadings as listed in Part 1 above (approx. 1000 words).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>You will be assessed on your ability to:</p>\n<p>•\tDesign teaching and learning sequences using knowledge of student learning, content, and effective teaching strategies</p>\n<p>•\tImplement teaching strategies that incorporate ICT and cross-curricular links to expand student learning opportunities</p>\n<p>•\tSelect and use a range of resources, including ICT, that engage students in their learning</p>\n<p>•\tDemonstrate knowledge and understanding of the concepts, substance and structure of the content and teaching strategies</p>\n<p>•\tDemonstrate knowledge and understanding of differentiation strategies to meet student learning needs/abilities</p>\n<p>•\tDemonstrate understanding of a range of assessment strategies and purposes (e.g., informal and formal, diagnostic, formative and summative)</p>\n<p>•\tSelect and use literature to justify teaching decisions</p>\n<p>•\tDemonstrate communication including written and visual representations skills consistent with personal, professional and academic conventions in traditional and digital texts.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>\n<p>You must submit the assessment electronically via the assignment link on the course website.

Once this data has been analysed, you will plan units of work, lessons, and assessments to provide students with the opportunity to develop knowledge and understanding of the content as well as to demonstrate what they have learnt. This assessment task is designed to provide preservice teachers with practical opportunities to individually and collaboratively demonstrate how creating a unit of work in mathematics can develop student conceptual understanding.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>TASK:</strong></p>\n<p>For this task, you are to design a unit of work that promotes students' mathematical understanding and supports numeracy development. This unit of work needs to demonstrate your knowledge of and skill in planning and sequencing content and tasks so that they become increasingly challenging and incorporate spacing and retrieval practices (CC 2.1 – assessed).  </p>\n<p>You will work in pairs to select a class set of data from a particular Year level. This is pre-assessment Mathematics data which links each question and the corresponding students’ responses to a content descriptor in mathematics. You are to analyse this data to determine your students’ strengths and identify concepts in mathematics that need to be taught or consolidated in the future. As a pair, you will need to write a short report of the analysed data, and finalise the report indicating the focus area of mathematics for your unit.</p>\n<p>Your final unit plan, including a summative assessment task, will be submitted in Week 12. For this final part of the assessment you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the QCAA unit plan template and the assessment matrix available through Blackboard.</li>\n<li>Write a unit overview in which you and your partner will briefly describe and explain the selection of the mathematical area as well as selection of topic and key concepts for the unit. The overview will also justify the pedagogical approach, goals for students across the full range of abilities and how teaching strategies are differentiated to meet their specific needs.</li>\n<li>Work collaboratively to revise your unit plan and develop a powerful teaching and learning sequence from the feedback received in Week 9. This teaching and learning sequence will be set out using the QCAA template. It will demonstrate achievable yet challenging student learning goals, suggested teaching and learning episodes (lessons) including how to progressively remove scaffolding as students become more proficient through a combination of underpinning mathematical concepts and skills as well as mathematical thinking and strategies and general thinking skills (CC 2.5.3 – practised), possible teaching and learning activities, ways to meet the needs of students with diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds including Indigenous students, and<strong> </strong>effectively select a range of evidence-based assessment practices to evaluate progress, adjust instruction, provide targeted feedback, and support learning<strong> </strong> (e.g., diagnostic, observation, consultation, peer/self, focused analysis, formative and summative assessment) (CC 2.3 – assessed). The document should show logical development for student conceptual development based on your chosen mathematical content area. Relevant high-quality classroom resources (including Information Communication Technology) should be detailed (links to documents or online resources should be included) – all need to be suitably referenced in one alphabetical list at the end of the assignment.</li>\n<li>Develop a culminating unit assessment piece that includes a student task sheet as well as an appropriate standards and criteria sheet. Ensure that the assessment task is designed to assess not only what but also how the unit will be taught (i.e., check alignment across content, concepts, skills, mathematical proficiencies, year-level specific curriculum content descriptors – including elaborations and achievement standards, student learning goals, and all teaching and learning activities) (CC 2.3.4 – practised). Demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the different purposes and instruments of assessment by including different forms such as diagnostic, observation, consultation, peer/self, focused analysis, formative and summative assessment.</li>\n<li>Include annotations on a set of six or more research articles from among the relevant literature (i.e., book chapters or journal articles) and/or sources of professional learning to explicitly support planning, teaching and assessment of the different concepts, dispositions, skills and inquiry processes in their unit. These annotations need to specifically evidence research-informed knowledge and understanding of ways to promote the teaching and learning of the mathematical concept.</li>\n<li>Include a complete reference list using correct APA format that includes all academic references as well as any resources used within the unit (one list).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Important information about group work</strong></p>\n<p>You will receive a single group mark for this task, as all group members should contribute equally to the design and delivery of the assessment task.
