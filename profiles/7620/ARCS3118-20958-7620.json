The target audience for your briefing document and presentation is a heritage professional working on behalf of the local community of that place. You will provide the guidance that the heritage professional will take back to the community for implementation. You should assume the local community wish to preserve the values of the place as best they can with limited funding. Your management strategies can either offer alternative uses for the site, or work with the ways the place is already being used.</p>\n<p>Many of the in-class exercises will provide you with the skills to complete this task; use the feedback provided on those to guide your approach here.</p>\n<p><strong>PART I: Management briefing document</strong></p>\n<p>Select a place that is <strong>NOT </strong>on any heritage register, list or overlay at the local, state, national or international levels. </p>\n<p>Visit the place and make first-hand observations about it, including photographing significant elements. The place will need to be accessible to the public or in a place you can freely access. Do not speak with any community members or anyone else associated with the place for your assessment. Your work will need to be supported by some research into the history of the place, but only enough to support your significance assessment and management strategies (it is not the focus of the task).</p>\n<p>Produce a short management briefing document that:</p>\n<p>1. Describes the place (including its boundaries, community and key visitors, history and site elements);</p>\n<p>2. Assesses its significance using the Burra Charter criteria;</p>\n<p>3. Proposes three realistic values-based, heritage management policies for the place.</p>\n<p>The word count is no more than 1500 words. The format should be a briefing document that clearly and professionally conveys the proposed management strategies for the place.</p>\n<p>You must include a GIS-created map to support your work; you may wish to convey the place boundary, heritage elements, significance and/or management strategies as a map. Your brief needs to include a reference list (including image sources).</p>\n<p>Your briefing document will be submitted to Turnitin in advance of a presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>PART II: Presenting your management plan</strong></p>\n<p>To present your findings you will give a 4-minute summary of your brief, followed by 4 minutes of informal questions and discussion about the work. The format will emulate a client meeting and gives you a chance to explain your work, particularly justifying and advocating for your heritage management policies.</p>\n<p>You should broadly follow the structure of the briefing document in your summary, focusing on the key parts and your reasoning. You can assume your audience has read your brief. A copy of the brief will be made available to you in the meeting, which you can refer to and guide the discussion. You will not be able to present a Powerpoint or other media in the meeting.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. You must submit an AI usage statement (template provided in tutorial and on Blackboard). Even if you did not use AI to support your writing, you must still submit the AI usage statement.
