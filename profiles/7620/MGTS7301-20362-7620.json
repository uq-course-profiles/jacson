The boardroom roleplay is worth 15 marks, totalling 30 marks (2 x 15 marks) for this element of the assessment task.</p>\n<p>In these assessable tutorials, students will be required to sit in their teams and discuss the Bunnings organisation using specific strategic analytical tools covered in those weeks. Students will need to read extra case material made available prior to the class along with a set of four (4) statements about the case, then come ready to write their response to these statements on an individual response sheet in the first phase of the tutorial. No extra materials or devices are allowed during this individual section. Students will be supplied the response sheet but should bring a pen to the tutorial. Students arriving late for this individual section (beginning 5 minutes after the start of the tutorial) are not permitted to submit an individual response and will lose three (3) marks.</p>\n<p>Then, in teams, students are to undertake a boardroom role play in which they deliberate how these tools and techniques can be practically applied, drawing upon each other's individual responses. Extra materials and devices are permitted during this phase but should be used discriminately. Teams are expected to reach a consensus position on which statement is most relevant to senior management of the case study organisation, then write this down on the worksheet that is provided. Students must also submit their individual response along the team worksheet to the tutor at the end of the class.</p>\n<p>Students will have three (3) opportunities to engage in this boardroom roleplay with the best two (2) marks contributing to their overall grade. These two (2) submissions are worth 15 marks each, totalling 30 marks in total.</p>\n<p>Teams are expected to provide peer evaluation data at the end of each of these three tutorials.
