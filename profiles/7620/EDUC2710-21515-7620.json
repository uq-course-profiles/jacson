This task is designed to assist you in developing a portfolio of quality Arts resources for your teaching.</p>\n<p><strong>In this task, </strong>you are required to:</p>\n<p>A) <strong><em>demonstrate understanding and appreciation</em></strong> of the core knowledge, skills and elements of each arts subject (drama, music, dance, media arts, visual arts), and how these contribute to authentic arts experiences; and,</p>\n<p>B) <strong><em>select and review</em></strong> five quality arts education resource – one from each arts subject (Dance, Drama, Media Arts, Music and Visual Arts).). Three of these resources are to be ones we have used in a tutorial or workshop – you will have time in tutorials to annotate these resources and prepare them for your portfolio. The other two resources you must source yourself and discuss with your tutor and peers in class.</p>\n<p><strong>For Section A)</strong> (approx. 800 words) you must cover the following in relation to all five arts subjects - drama, music, dance, media arts, and visual arts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A succinct explanation of the core knowledge, skills and elements for each arts subject with reference to course content, recommended readings and other sources. A reflection on how each subject provides a unique opportunity for aesthetic and creative development should also be included. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For Section B)</strong> (approx. 1200 words) you are to select and review <strong>five quality, culturally appropriate arts education resources (one each from the five different arts subjects)</strong>. <strong>Critically analyse </strong>the quality of the resources according to these <strong>three criteria and guiding questions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Criteria 1: Quality of learning in the resource. (See Task Sheet for Guiding Questions)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Criteria 2: Quality of connections to the Australian curriculum – Arts. (See Task Sheet for Guiding Questions)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Criteria 3: Quality of use for you as a beginning teacher. </strong>(<strong>See Task Sheet for Guiding Questions)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
