The papers indicated in the course profile represent the minimum reading that you are expected to undertake. Students are encouraged to read further to develop a broader understanding of the topic.</p>\n<p>Each essay will be 1000 words in length (+/- 100 words). Longer or shorter submissions will not be accepted. Each essay must provide full bibliographic details, but these are NOT counted within the word limit. You are required to submit each essay as an electronic copy through Turnitin via Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Your essay should be consistent with the following structure; additional sub-headings may be used as appropriate:</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Introduce the topic, place the papers in context and show how they relate to the theme of your essay.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Summarize the main arguments of the papers as well as key aspects of the relevant class discussion.</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Identify and discuss the main ideas and arguments presented in the papers and examine any strengths, weaknesses and omissions found in the papers.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>Read more broadly on the topic so as to be able to include additional context and perspective in your analysis.</p>\n<p><strong> 5. Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Provide a brief summary of the main findings of your review, showing how the papers help inform the topic.</p>\n<p><strong> 6. References</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>List all references cited (UQ Harvard style recommended).</p>\n<p><strong>** The use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT and Copilot) **</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
