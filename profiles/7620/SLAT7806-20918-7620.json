Each entry should be <strong>between 100 and 200 words in length </strong>and is worth <strong>3 per cent</strong> of the final grade, contributing a <strong>total of 15 per cent</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this assessment is to promote regular reflection on your learning and to support you in connecting theoretical discussions of research methods to your own developing research interests. Through these reflections, you will consolidate your understanding of research design, identify areas of uncertainty, and consider how different methodological approaches may be applied to empirical research in Applied Linguistics.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT</strong></p>\n<p>Each journal entry should reflect on your learning from a particular session of the course and engage meaningfully with the content covered. You may consider what you learned about research methods or research design during that session, which methodological approaches or analytical techniques were introduced, what aspects you found challenging or unclear, and how the concepts discussed could inform the design of a research project in Applied Linguistics. Not all aspects need to be addressed in every entry; rather, entries should demonstrate thoughtful, reflective, and substantive engagement with the session content.</p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Presentations will be scheduled between Weeks 4 and 12. The presentation should provide a clear and coherent overview of the chapter’s key concepts, research approaches, and methodological insights, and should include a short in-class activity designed to actively engage peers with the content. Presentations will be delivered in class and recorded for moderation purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>REFLECTIVE COMMENTARY</strong></p>\n<p>Following the presentation, students are required to submit a 400-word individual reflective commentary.
