Therefore, choose a scenario that interests you, as per the criteria below, as your selection will affect all three tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>\n<p>You are in a management position at a privately owned company that manages tourist attraction(s) and/ or event(s). As a manager of this company, you are one of a number of people on the Executive Committee. Your company has been very successful over recent years, but you have some concerns that the Committee is starting to get a bit complacent and is losing sight of the bigger picture. You have been doing some part-time study, and you have been learning about tourism systems. Leiper's Tourism System (LTS) stood out to you as a good model to apply to one tourist attraction or event that your company manages.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment overview </strong></p>\n<p>Through your three (3) assessment tasks this semester, you will convince the Executive Committee of the benefits of applying LTS to your chosen tourist attraction or event. This is how the three tasks link together:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will <strong>draft a proposal </strong>to outline your ideas and reasoning of applying LTS to your attraction/event. You will receive feedback before presenting to the Executive Committee. </li>\n<li>You will <strong>deliver a 5-minute pitch + 5 minutes questions</strong> and discussion to the Executive Committee, where you will justify why applying the LTS to your attraction/event is beneficial from a management perspective.</li>\n<li>As required by the Committee following your pitch, you will <strong>evaluate and report </strong>on the role of transport throughout your tourism system. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Selecting a tourist attraction or event</strong></p>\n<p>When choosing a tourist attraction or event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your choice of one tourist attraction or event must be a small to medium enterprise (SME). NOTE: Mega events like the Olympics, and tourist attractions like Disneyland, are too big and are therefore not suitable.</li>\n<li>The tourist attraction or event you choose needs to be real. It should be an attraction or event that you are familiar with and/or that you have visited.</li>\n<li>Be mindful that the tourist to this chosen attraction/event must originate from a generating region<strong> </strong>where distance requires that the tourist spend at least one night at the destination. Moreover, the generating, transit and destination must be distinct regions.</li>\n<li>Your research will ONLY be based on publicly available information. Do NOT contact the management company or the tourist attraction or event.</li>\n<li>Each student must have a different tourist attraction or event. Therefore, the quicker you select and confirm your tourist attraction or event with your teaching team, the better chance you will have of getting your choice of attraction or event. An updated list will be managed by the teaching team and made available on Blackboard throughout the semester.  </li>\n<li>The management company you are representing does not need to be real, but it can be the company that owns the tourist attraction or event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Task description </strong></p>\n<p>Your first task is to draft a proposal<strong> (recorded video of 2-3 minutes) </strong>that explains your ideas and reasoning for applying LTS to your chosen attraction or event. Your proposal should be clear, engaging, and convincing to your audience. Since the Executive Committee may not be familiar with LTS, your proposal must present the concept in simple and clear terms. You will submit this proposal using the AI Bongo Learn platform where you will receive feedback from AI and the teaching team before presenting to the committee. </p>\n<p><strong>Purpose </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment is designed to: </p>\n<p>• Develop skills in structuring and presenting your ideas clearly and effectively within a limited timeframe.</p>\n<p>• Use feedback as learning to strengthen your pitch to the Executive Committee (Assessment 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions </strong></p>\n<p>Your proposal must include</p>\n<p>• a brief description of the tourist attraction or event your company is managing;</p>\n<p>• identification of one (1) target market and its generating region;</p>\n<p>• a description of the transit region;</p>\n<p>• a description of the destination region;</p>\n<p>• only one (1) PowerPoint slide for your proposal. </p>\n<p>You will submit your proposal (recorded video) on the Bongo Learn tool accessed through Blackboard. On the platform, alongside your recording, you must attach your one slide PPT. To receive a mark for this assessment task, both the recording and the one-slide PPT must be submitted, as one will not be accepted in place of the other. Ensure you keep the submission receipt screenshot for your reference.</p>\n<p><strong>Other information </strong></p>\n<p>Task format</p>\n<p>[Bongo information]</p>\n<p>Bongo Learn is a video-based learning and assessment platform that will help you practice your presentation skills and receive feedback on your performance. When you record your pitch using the platform, it will use AI to provide feedback on your performance based on the marking criteria of the assessment. To receive feedback from Bongo, log in through Blackboard, open Bongo, and click the Record button to begin your recording. You will also see an attachment icon, which you can use to upload your PowerPoint file.</p>\n<p>In using Bongo Learn, you get repeated practice and immediate reflection opportunities, helping you improve your oral presentation skills. </p>\n<p>Further instructions will be provided in the class.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of artificial intelligence</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You have approached the Chair of the Executive Committee for your company, and they have given you space on the agenda at the next Committee meeting to justify and discuss your ideas. </p>\n<p><strong>Task description </strong></p>\n<p>Your next task is to present a pitch to the Executive Committee, justifying why you believe applying LTS to your attraction or event is beneficial from a management perspective. You are allotted a total of 10-minutes in the meeting; <strong>5-minutes </strong>should be dedicated to delivering your pitch, followed by <strong>5-minutes</strong> for questions and discussions with the committee.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment is designed to: </p>\n<p>•\tApply theoretical knowledge (including LTS) to practice through a real-world tourist attraction or event. </p>\n<p>•\tCommunicate complex ideas and justify your reasoning through persuasive communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Prepare and deliver a 5-minute pitch to the Executive Committee. Your pitch must include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a description of your chosen tourist attraction or event; </li>\n<li>an image of your system and its functionality. This will be based on LTS, and it can be either computer-generated or hand-drawn.</li>\n<li>a justification for why you believe applying LTS to your attraction or event is beneficial from a management perspective; and</li>\n<li>a profile of one (1) existing or potential target market for your attraction or event.</li>\n<li><em>THEN</em>, based on your chosen target market, also identify and justify: </li>\n<li>the characteristics of an appropriate generating region, including why this information is relevant;</li>\n<li>the characteristics of the transit region, including why this information is relevant;</li>\n<li>the characteristics of the destination, including why this information is relevant; and</li>\n<li>two (2) external influences that could impact your system, including the potential nature of their impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Present your pitch in a way that best showcases your ideas, using a format of your choice (e.g., handouts, poster illustrations, drawings, slide deck, etc). You are encouraged to be creative. The key is to choose a format that will help you to clearly and accurately demonstrate your deep disciplinary knowledge, precisely apply relevant theory, and integrate that knowledge to produce novel insights. Following your pitch, there will be a 5-minute question and discussion with the Executive Committee. You should be prepared to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justify the relevance of Leiper’s tourism system for tourism and event businesses in the private sector;</li>\n<li>Explain the elements of your tourism system to the committee; and</li>\n<li>Explain the potential impact of external influences on the tourism system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Other information </strong></p>\n<p>Task format</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This assessment will be conducted within class time as an oral presentation + Q&amp;A.</li>\n<li>Committee meeting recording: Please note that this assessment will be recorded as required by UQ’s Assessment Procedure. </li>\n<li>References are NOT required to be included in the pitch itself. </li>\n<li>Resources - Your research will ONLY be based on publicly available information.
