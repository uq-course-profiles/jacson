You will use your skills to attract mock-industry funding partners.</p>\n<p>This assessment involves developing ideas for two novel pharmaceutical products of your own innovation for the treatment of a medical condition that is part of your company's portfolio. The task is to produce a written proposal for your company's two new medical entities. These entities must relate to the pharmaceutical industry and your company portfolio, but could be a novel medicine/drug, a medical device, a drug delivery system, formulation, or even an app! The two innovations may be related (e.g. novel drug and associated delivery device, biomarker monitoring device and connected mobile phone app) or completely separate (two new drugs, for instance) but they must target the diseases of your company's portfolio.</p>\n<p>You will use patent literature and other resources to identify potential candidates for your own development, and with newly acquired knowledge of how Big Pharma innovate, you will promote your product to a Board (your peers). Although the innovations are fictitious, the report, the items and the scientific claims must be novel, realistic, and achievable. While there is room for creative and imaginative input, care must be taken to ensure that all claims and projected benefits are plausible within real-world pharmaceutical development constraints.</p>\n<p>The document should be no more than <strong>1,500 words</strong> (excluding tables, figures, references, and appendices).</p>\n<p>All references must be formatted using Vancouver style.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Students should consult the assessment section within the Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site for detailed task requirements and marking criteria.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
