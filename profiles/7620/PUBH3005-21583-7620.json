The team is in the planning stages for development of a new health promotion strategy involving a specific population group and health behaviour. To support the strategy development, you have been tasked with appraising examples of previous strategies, focused on the same population group and health behaviour, from which the team could draw key learnings.</p>\n<p>Your task is to critically appraise a published study of a relevant health behaviour strategy, summarising key learnings of the study and reflecting on the study outcomes, to form the basis for recommendations about the new strategy. You will present your appraisal and recommendations to the NGO leadership group, who will then ask you a series of questions to gain a deeper understanding of your appraisal and recommendations.</p>\n<p>The Oral Presentation comprises Part A of this assessment item (weighting: 30%), and the Oral Examination comprises Part B (Pass/Fail).
