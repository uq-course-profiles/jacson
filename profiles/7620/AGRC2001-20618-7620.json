Tutorial classes are designed to support students' learning and understanding of chemistry. The tutorial class will be structured into two main parts. The first part will be an opportunity for students to work in groups to attempt practice questions, check their responses to questions with tutors, and improve their understanding of concepts covered in previous weeks. The second part will be an in-class quiz assessment, which will be done individually under 'exam-like' conditions. The assessable content of the in-class quiz will be based on topics taught in previous lectures (see Blackboard for more information).</p>\n<p>The in-class quiz assessment is a 'closed book' examination conducted under similar conditions as the exams with students allowed \"one A4 page typed or hand-written double-sided\". Students are required to bring their own UQ approved <a href=\"http://my.uq.edu.au/services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/sitting-exam/approved-calculators\">calculator</a>. Electronic aids (e.g., laptop or phone) are not permitted. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Tutorial non-attendanceﾠ</p>\n<p>Acceptable evidence for tutorial non-attendance is similar to the evidence required for a <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/files/7717/evidence-deferred-exam-application.pdf\">deferred examination</a>. The tutorial sessions are timetabled activities, and if students miss a tutorial, they must provide documentation that shows they were unable to attend the tutorial on the relevant day. Documentation for ongoing conditions, such as Student Access Plans, are not acceptable evidence for missed sessions. If approved, options for missed sessions will be discussed with individual students.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
