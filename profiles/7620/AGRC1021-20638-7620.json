There are <strong>five practical sessions</strong> during the semester: one introductory session (Session 1) and four assessed sessions (Sessions 2-5). Each assessed session contributes 5% to your final grade for this task to a total of 20%.</p>\n<p><strong>Session 1. Laboratory Induction and Orientation</strong></p>\n<p>The first session is a mandatory laboratory induction and orientation. This introductory session provides the necessary safety inductions and covers essential laboratory safety protocols while familiarising you with equipment and procedures used throughout the semester. You must attend be fully inducted to the lab (completing both the online and in person induction) to participate in subsequent assessed practical sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sessions 2 - 5: Practical Sessions</strong></p>\n<p>Following the introductory session, each of the four assessed practical sessions is related to a specific theory module covered in lectures. </p>\n<p>During each session, you will complete exercises in your practical manual based on observations of living organisms and collection of experimental data. Your manual will be assessed at the conclusion of each session based on your demonstrated skills competence and completion of exercises. You may work collaboratively on practical activities, but your manual must contain your own work and reflect your individual understanding. Specific practical activities (for example, microscope setup) may also be assessed by demonstrators during the practical session. In these cases, it will be noted clearly in the practical manual. Practical manuals remain in the laboratory at all times and cannot be taken home to ensure data integrity and prevent academic misconduct.</p>\n<p><em>Laboratory Safety Protocols</em><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Students are not permitted to have electronic devices (phones, laptops, iPads) on the laboratory bench for safety reasons. Electronic devices can be left outside the laboratory or handed to a demonstrator upon entering the lab.</p>\n<p><em>Use of AI </em></p>\n<p>This assessment is completed in-person during practical sessions. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools is not permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding the Nature of Practical Sessions in this Course </strong></p>\n<p>These practicals differ from other course assessments in important ways that affect attendance and assessment policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Material and Time-Sensitive Experiments:</strong> The practical exercises utilise living specimens (plants, invertebrates, fungi), some of which are collected at particular times and/or undergo specific treatments over predetermined periods. These biological processes cannot be paused, repeated, or replicated outside the scheduled timeframe due to environmental conditions. Once the practical period concludes, the experimental conditions that form the basis of student observations and data collection are no longer available.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource and Logistical Constraints:</strong> The specialised equipment, controlled environment growth facilities, purchase of live invertebrate organisms, and staff supervision required make it prohibitively expensive and logistically impossible to replicate practical sessions for individual students or small groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Absence from a Practical Session</strong></p>\n<p>If you miss your scheduled practical session, you will receive zero marks for that sessions assessment. No additional learning materials or practical sessions will be made available without approval from a practical absence.</p>\n<p>If you miss your scheduled practical session due to circumstances beyond your control (e.g., illness) you must submit an <a href=\"https://studenthub.uq.edu.au/form.aspx?id=5913956.\">approved absence request</a> .</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit your request <strong>prior to or on the day of the missed session</strong></li>\n<li>Include acceptable supporting documentation (<a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension?p=1#1\">see approved reasons and documentation</a>)</li>\n<li>Find the submission link in Course Resources (Blackboard Ultra)</li>\n<li>Requests without proper documentation may not be approved. It is your responsibility to submit applications with correct documentation.</li>\n<li>Due to the challenges of coordinating practical classes with biological organisms, no extensions or make up sessions are available for this course. Alternative assessment arrangements for approved absences will be organised individually by the course coordinator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact the School - </em><a href=\"mailto:agriculture@enquire.uq.edu.au\"><em>agriculture@enquire.uq.edu.au</em></a><em>.  </em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
