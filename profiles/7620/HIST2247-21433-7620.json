If their campaigns were unsuccessful or only partially successful, why? If they did achieve their goals, what factors contributed to this outcome?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In answering these questions, you may interpret “section of society” or “group” narrowly (focusing on the group itself) or more broadly, to include its supporters, advocates, and allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Referencing Requirements: </strong>This is a research essay. You are expected to engage with a substantial body of historical scholarship and primary evidence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your essay must be fully referenced using footnotes (Chicago 17 or 17A) and include a bibliography.</li>\n<li>In-text referencing is not permitted.</li>\n<li>All references to books and journal articles must include specific page numbers (not page ranges). Essays that do not include page numbers may be returned for resubmission and may be penalised.</li>\n<li>Footnotes are not included in the word count unless they are discursive in nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this assignment, you should consult at least ten secondary sources and at least three primary sources. Primary sources should, wherever possible, originate from members of the group you are examining.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Limits: </strong><em>A word count that is within ±10% of the set length (word limit) is acceptable. Word count does not include footnotes; however, discursive footnotes are included in the word count. A word count that is outside these 10% will receive a proportionate penalty and will be graded against the grading criteria.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Presentation &amp; Style: </strong>Your essay must be written in continuous prose, using a standard essay format (no dot points). The argument should be clearly structured and coherently developed. Please familiarise yourself with the university’s policies on plagiarism. <strong>Any essay found to contain evidence of plagiarism will be subject to disciplinary action.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. Students must also fill out an AI disclosure sheet and submit it as the cover page for their essay.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Tutorial Discussion Questions What is the significance of the term “protection”? What powers, and under what circumstances, did the NSW legislation grant to the “protector”? How did children experience the “protection”, and how did their experiences match with the intentions of child removal? Why were reunions with parents often less than ideal? Are the children passive victims? Is there something problematic about non-Indigenous historians and governments writing Indigenous history? Is there too much emphasis on conflict and atrocity?

            "topic_description": "Week 9 Tutorial: Black Power, Black Rights The late 1960s and 1970s were periods of great cultural and political change in many Western nations, with a raft of social movements attempting to change the social order. These included movements for peace; Black Power; the green movement; feminism and gay rights. In this tutorial, we will examine some aspects of how indigenous Australians experienced this period of so-called revolution. In doing so we will consider a particular problem – how is it that the successful 1967 referendum, which was supposed to improve the lot of Indigenous Australians, was soon followed by the rise of the Black Power movement and the establishment of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy? Tutorial Discussion Questions Why, according to McGregor, was there such an overwhelmingly positive response to the 1967 referendum? And why, in some ways, was that counter-productive? Why was the Black Power movement so discontented despite the overwhelming response, and what did it seek instead? And why was there such strong public support for the Tent Embassy?
