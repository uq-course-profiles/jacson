Criminology students need to understand how AI systems can reproduce bias, how to verify AI-generated information, and how to evaluate algorithmic decision-making critically. This isn't just about using technology; it's about understanding how technology shapes crime, justice, and inequality. By developing AI literacy, students gain the analytical tools to work effectively in AI-mediated criminal justice systems while maintaining their commitment to fairness, accountability, and human dignity.</p>\n<p><strong>PART 1: Select your crime case/incident</strong></p>\n<p>Choose one crime news incident that has generated public discussion. This could be:</p>\n<p>·        A specific criminal case focusing on an individual (e.g., a high-profile robbery, assault, fraud case)</p>\n<p>·        A specific crime incident that involves more than one offender (E.g. 1999 WTO riot in Seattle, Cronulla race riot 2005)</p>\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n<p>·        Must be from a credible news source (e.g., ABC News, The Guardian, BBC, local newspapers)</p>\n<p>·        Include a link to your news article in your submission</p>\n<p>·        May include international incidents</p>\n<p>Briefly describe the incident (100 words max)</p>\n<p><strong>PART 2: AI-Generated Summaries </strong></p>\n<p>Use at least 2 different AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini) to generate summaries of your crime incident.</p>\n<p>Prompt each AI with:</p>\n<p>\"Provide a detailed summary of [<em>crime incident name/description</em>] including: what happened, who was involved, the criminal charges or outcomes, and any key facts about the case.\"</p>\n<p>For each AI tool, document:</p>\n<p>·        Which AI tool you used</p>\n<p>·        The exact prompt you provided</p>\n<p>·        Screenshot or copy of the AI's complete response</p>\n<p>·        Brief comparison (50-100 words total): How did the two AI summaries differ? Which seemed more detailed or accurate at first glance?</p>\n<p><strong>PART 3: Fact-Checking Claims</strong></p>\n<p>Now become a fact-checker! Select the most detailed AI summary from Part A and verify its claims.</p>\n<p>Identify and fact-check at least 4 specific claims the AI made. For each claim:</p>\n<p>1. The Claim (quote exactly what the AI said)</p>\n<p>2. Fact-Check Result:</p>\n<p>·        ✓ TRUE - Accurate</p>\n<p>·        ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE - Mostly accurate but missing nuance/context</p>\n<p>·        ✗ FALSE - Incorrect or misleading</p>\n<p>·        ? UNVERIFIABLE - Cannot confirm with available sources</p>\n<p>3. Evidence (150-200 words per claim):</p>\n<p>·        What sources did you use to verify? (provide links/citations)</p>\n<p>·        What did you find?</p>\n<p>·        If false/misleading, what's the accurate information?</p>\n<p>·        Why might the AI have gotten this wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>PART 4: Critical Reflection</strong></p>\n<p>Write 200-250 words reflecting on:</p>\n<p>·        AI Accuracy: How accurate was the AI overall? What types of errors did it make (factual mistakes, hallucinations, oversimplifications, bias)?</p>\n<p>·        Implications for Research: What are the risks of using AI for criminological research without verification? How should students use AI responsibly?</p>\n<p>·        Your Process: What fact-checking strategies worked best? What challenges did you face?</p>\n<p><em>Please note that reproductions of Ai output do not count towards the total word count.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Second, to help you practice and develop your theory application and argument skills learned in the lecture and reading material each week.</p>\n<p>During tutorials in weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12, you will complete an interactive exercise. These exercises are based on analysing and responding to real-world crime scenarios presented through videos, case studies, artifacts, or news reports shown in class. You will work through these scenarios by applying criminological theories and concepts to explain criminal behaviour, identify contributing factors, and develop analytical responses.</p>\n<p>These exercises are designed to help you practice critical thinking skills, engage with real-world crime scenarios, and demonstrate your understanding of lecture content and reading material through practical application. Explicit instructions on how each exercise works will be provided at the beginning of each tutorial.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Security Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>These are secure, identity-verified assessments with the following requirements:</p>\n<p>·        In-person attendance mandatory - Exercises can only be completed during your assigned tutorial</p>\n<p>·        No digital devices permitted - Computers, phones, tablets, or other digital devices cannot be used during the exercise – unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<p>·        Paper-based responses only - You must complete responses on the paper materials provided by your tutor</p>\n<p>·        No external materials - Textbooks, notes, or outside materials are not permitted during the exercise</p>\n<p>·        No AI assistance - Artificial intelligence tools cannot be used to assist or complete these exercises</p>\n<p>·        Translation - translation dictionaries are allowed only.</p>\n<p><em>Failure to abide by these conditions may result in an academic misconduct allegation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Grading Structure:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are 8 exercises offered over the course of the semester. You may attempt all of them; however, your best 5 exercise scores will contribute to 40% of your final grade.</strong> Each exercise is worth 8 points (total possible: 40 points toward final grade).</p>\n<p>Everything you need to complete each exercise will be provided to you in class.</p>\n<p>Since you have multiple opportunities to complete exercises throughout the semester, <em>no make-ups, extensions, or alternative arrangements are available. This is not a formal examination, so deferred assessment options do not apply.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Why does this assessment matter?</strong></p>\n<p>These interactive exercises are designed to help you apply theoretical knowledge to real-world crime scenarios in a supervised setting. They are designed to ensure that you are meeting the learning outcomes of this course and develop skills including critical thinking, give you an opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned, and build your confidence in theory application before your major assessment. In addition, these exercises help you to practice your exam-style thinking in a low-stakes environment and ensure the academic integrity of your learning. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Even if you did not use AI to support your writing, you must still submit the AI usage statement. Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0 for this assessment. </strong></p>\n<p>You will apply a criminological theory to explain the criminal behaviour in your chosen crime case (from the Crime Fact Checking Investigation assessment). Your submission includes TWO components: (1) a focused written argument explaining how your theory applies to the case, and (2) a visual pathway diagram mapping the theoretical explanation into the specific facts of the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Why have I assigned this task?</strong> Criminologists use theory to explain why crime occurs and why people offend. This assessment asks you to apply a theoretical framework to understand and explain a real world crime incident or criminal behaviour. The written component develops your ability to effectively construct an evidence-based argument, while the visual diagram helps you see and communicate the causal pathways that the theory proposes. Together, these skills are essential for anyone pursuing advanced criminological study and/or a career in criminal justice.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part A: Written Component (1200 words - 25 marks)</strong></p>\n<p>Your written argument must answer the following question:</p>\n<p>How does [insert chosen theory here] explain why [insert chosen offender here] engaged in criminal behaviour?</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p>How does [insert chosen theory here] explain how [insert chosen incident here] occurred?</p>\n<p>Your written argument should include:</p>\n<p>-         A theory chosen covered in the course and contained in the list provided on Blackboard</p>\n<p>-         An explanation of the central principles or key elements of the theory</p>\n<p>-         And ONE example from peer-reviewed literature on how the theory has been applied to similar cases</p>\n<p>-         An argument as to how your chosen theory explains the criminal behaviour in your chosen crime case</p>\n<p>-         ONE critique of your chosen theory that is supported by evidence by peer-reviewed literature</p>\n<p><em>This is not a formal essay so there is no need for introductions/conclusions. Just focus on your argument. </em></p>\n<p><strong>PART B: Theory Pathway Diagram (15 marks)</strong></p>\n<p>You will create a one A4 page visual diagram of the causal pathway you are arguing is occurring to produce the criminal behaviour/incident. Examples of how to do this will be provided in lecture and in tutorials.</p>\n<p>You may draw this pathway by hand (as long as it can be clearly read) or digitally create the diagram pathway. Your diagram must visually demonstrate HOW your case maps onto the causal pathway proposed by your chosen theory. You must include examples/evidence from your chosen crime case on the theoretical diagram.</p>\n<p><strong>Source Requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A minimum of 3 scholarly, peer-reviewed references</li>\n<li>Reliable sources about your chosen case (i.e. news reports, court documents, official reports)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You may use AI to SUPPORT your writing. </strong>Tutorials will include a discussion of what appropriate AI usage looks like for this assessment.</p>\n<p>This course prepares you to be able to have ethical and responsible conversations and develop practices about using AI. The AI statement is linked to this component of the class. Please note that you must submit an AI statement regardless of whether you have used AI. <strong>Failure to do so will result in a 0 grade for this assessment. </strong></p>\n<p><em>The visual diagram, reference list, and AI statement are not included in the word count.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
