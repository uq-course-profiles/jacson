You are encouraged to discuss the concepts behind the assignment but under no circumstances should you show your code to, or allow your code to be seen by, another student. You should not look at the code of any other student. You must sufficiently protect all electronic and paper copies of your code. All submitted code will be subject to electronic plagiarism and collusion detection. Assignments with no academic merit will be awarded a mark of zero. You may have to verbally answer questions about your submission as part of the assignment marking process.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming Assignment Interviews</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching staff will conduct interviews with a subset of students about their submissions for the purpose of establishing genuine authorship. If you write your own code, you have nothing to fear from this process. If you legitimately use permitted code from other sources (following the usage/referencing requirements in the assignment specification) then you are expected to understand that code. If you are not able to adequately explain the design of your solution and/or adequately explain your submitted code and/or be able to make simple modifications to your solution as requested at the interview, then your assignment mark will be scaled down based on the level of understanding you are able to demonstrate and/or your submission may be subject to a misconduct investigation where your interview responses form part of the evidence.</p>\n<p>Interview invitations will be sent to your student email account up until the end of Week 1 of the exam period. Students are asked to respond by the deadline stated in the invitation, which will be at least one week after it is sent. If you are unable to attend your initially scheduled interview, you will have one opportunity to reschedule. Zero marks will be awarded only if the rescheduled interview is not attended, or if the interview invitation is not responded to by the stated deadline, unless exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated with supporting evidence.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
