The tutorial exercises consist of <strong>four </strong>reading comprehension questions and <strong>two </strong>speculative questions. The weekly questions will be made available on Blackboard. Answers to the reading comprehension questions should be short (one to two sentences in length) and should refer to a specific passage in the weekly reading. Answers to the speculative questions should be more expansive (a short paragraph). These questions will form the basis of tutorial discussions.</p>\n<p>To be awarded the two marks for each tutorial, you must: </p>\n<p>a) Upload your responses to Turnitin by 5pm on the day before your tutorial. </p>\n<p>b) Correctly answer at least two of the short answers and produce answers of appropriate length and quality to the longer questions.</p>\n<p>c) Attend the tutorial and participate meaningfully in class discussion.</p>\n<p>There are no part marks, i.e. your mark each week will be either 2 or 0 (your score will be treated as a proxy for the quality of your participation).</p>\n<p>There are eight worksheets in total, one for each of the tutorials. But only <strong>seven </strong>will count toward your final grade, totally <strong>14%</strong>. In theory, this means that you can miss one tutorial exercise without incurring a penalty. For students who submit all eight exercises, we will take the best seven.  </p>\n<p>Missed tutorials due to illness will be counted if a doctor’s certificate is provided. If you are unable to attend due to technical issues or other unavoidable circumstances, please contact your course coordinator or tutor <strong>prior </strong>to the tutorial. In such cases, you may submit 250‑word summaries for each of the set readings, along with the worksheet. Please note that there will be a limit to the number of summaries that can be submitted in lieu of participation.</p>\n<p>***This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
