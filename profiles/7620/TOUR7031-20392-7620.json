The critique you have developed in Assessment 1 and the feedback given will be used as the basis of Assessment 2.</p>\n<p>As a consultant, provide the manager of a tourism operation with recommendations for enhancing the visitor experience for a target market.

Your course coordinator or tutor will role play the tourism manager. </p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>The meeting will consist of two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1 - Presenting 2–3 priority recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>Your recommendations are directly related to the Site Critique task you submitted earlier and should:</p>\n<p>•\tProvide suggestions for improvements to the identified weaknesses. You can also provide suggestions for how the site can further improve their strengths.</p>\n<p>•\tBe clearly linked to the needs and preferences of the ONE target market you have selected.</p>\n<p>•\tBe innovative, strategic, feasible, realistic and measurable.</p>\n<p>Clearly state what is recommended and how to achieve this. For example, it is insufficient to say there are no multi-lingual signs so the recommendation is to install multi-lingual signs. Rather, you should be stating WHY multilingual signs would be beneficial, WHERE they should be placed and WHAT specific languages should be considered. </p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 - Conversation with your manager</strong></p>\n<p>You will be asked questions about your recommendations. Specifically, you will be asked about:</p>\n<p>•\thow you applied what you learned about the key principles of the visitor experience in the course so far to the design of your recommendations.</p>\n<p>•\tyour recommendations with regards to your research in the Site Critique and learning in the first part of the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>The task is an opportunity to: </p>\n<p>•\tPropose evidence based, feasible recommendations that improve visitor experience, accessibility, sustainability, cultural safety, and commercial outcomes.</p>\n<p>•\tShowcase your knowledge and learning situated in a scenario aligned to a workplace/professional scenario.</p>\n<p>•\tDevelop your skills to communicate professionally with a manager in the tourism sector.</p>\n<p>No printed materials or notes are to be used for this briefing.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>AI-Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
