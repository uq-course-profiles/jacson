This task requires you to analyse historical and projected climate data, assess its impact on a specific cropping system, and propose scientifically justified agronomic strategies to mitigate risks.</p>\n<p>You may focus on climate change impacts that are already occurring or projected for your chosen region, such as: Increased temperature; changes in rainfall patterns or drought frequency; extreme weather events; sea‑level rise and salinity etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>For a specific location of your choice, your presentation must include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe climatic variability and climate change</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Use historical and projected climate data to quantify key trends (e.g. temperature, rainfall, extremes).</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Assess impacts on a main cropping system</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain the likely overall impact of climate change on crop production under current agronomic practice.</li>\n<li>Analyse the specific effect of one climate factor (e.g. high temperature, drought, salinity) on crop growth and yield.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Propose agronomic adaptations</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Recommend at least three (3) agronomic modifications that could maintain or enhance productivity under future climate conditions, such as crop calendar (e.g. planting date, crop duration); cultivation or tillage method; crop variety or genotype; fertiliser and nutrient management; plant population or spacing; weed management.</li>\n<li>All strategies must be scientifically justified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong></p>\n<p>Your presentation will be assessed on the quality and relevance of content in each of the three sections above, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appropriate use of literature in relation to climate data </li>\n<li>Understanding of climate–crop relationships</li>\n<li>Scientific justification of proposed agronomic strategies with a conclusion</li>\n<li>Clarity, logic, and effectiveness of communication within the 10‑minute time limit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your presentation must go beyond generic discussions of climate change and engage deeply with data interpretation, real-world case studies, and practical applications. While AI tools can assist with research, your analysis must include <strong>original observations, critical evaluation, and site-specific recommendations based on evidence</strong>.</p>\n<p>The assessment and marking criteria sheet used for this course is on the blackboard site.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

The Minister is concerned that the local agriculture may not be sustainable and asked you to develop a strategy for the development of more sustainable agriculture. The location is a sub-tropical to upper temperate region (You need to choose and specify the location/region that you are focussing on, such as southern Queensland), with distinct seasonal differences in weather, and some areas are based on annual crops while others are on perennial crops. By examining the situation further, it is realized that the existing system is unsustainable in the long term either because of difficulty in maintaining high crop yield or due to major economic (eg, high labour cost) and environmental (eg, soil erosion) issues. It is thus required to examine the possibility of changing from the established practices to a different system of production. (The proponents of change are aware of the social dimension of sustainability, but this aspect is beyond the scope of the present consultancy request)</p>\n<p><strong>Needs to be considered: </strong></p>\n<p>For example, if your chosen region was southern Queensland,</p>\n<p>·      Summer crops are summer cereals (maize and grain sorghum), cotton and occasionally soybeans, peanuts, mungbeans or sunflowers.</p>\n<p>·      Winter crops are wheat, barley, chickpeas and mungbeans.</p>\n<p>·      Perennials may be sugarcane or fruit crops.</p>\n<p>You need to choose the summer-winter annual cropping system and then define the agronomic system that is likely to be sustainable.</p>\n<p><strong>Your tasks as a senior agronomist are to:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>i) </strong>Evaluate the sustainability of the existing system and comment on the Minister’s concern.</p>\n<p><strong>ii) </strong>Identify aspects of the existing system that lead to lack of sustainability from crop production, economic and environmental viewpoints.</p>\n<p><strong>iii) </strong>Establish production and resource management objectives that a revised system of production should meet.</p>\n<p><strong>iv) </strong>Assess alternative production systems that may be adopted in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>v) </strong>Recommend an alternative agronomic system and describe sequence/s of production of the range of crops you propose.</p>\n<p><strong>vi) </strong>Provide guidelines to the process of implementation of the revised system.</p>\n<p><strong>vii) </strong>Provide guidelines to the assessment of the effectiveness of the revised system in meeting the objectives proposed in (iii) above.</p>\n<p>Your 3-minute pitch presentation will be assessed based on the content for each of the tasks mentioned above. The assessment and marking criteria used for this course is on the blackboard site.</p>\n<p>As part of the assessment, you are also required to submit a 200-word reflection on the learnings from your active engagement in the 3 minute-pitch session.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>Your presentation will be assessed based on the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Depth of analysis</strong> - Use of real-world data, critical thinking, and originality.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality of data interpretation</strong> - Selection and meaningful discussion of datasets/literature.</li>\n<li><strong>Scientific rigor</strong> - Justification of agronomic recommendations with empirical evidence.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation clarity and engagement</strong> - Logical flow, confident delivery, and professional articulation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Final Notes</strong></p>\n<p>This task requires <strong>critical evaluation and original thought</strong>. AI tools can assist with research, but your interpretation, analysis, and recommendations must be unique and justified. Presentations that rely solely on generic AI-generated content <strong>without data interpretation or real-world engagement</strong> will receive lower grades.</p>\n<p>By completing this task, you will develop essential communication skills in <strong>delivering complex scientific information concisely and persuasively - </strong>a key skill for agronomists in the field.
