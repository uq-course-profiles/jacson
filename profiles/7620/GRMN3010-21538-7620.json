However, the course materials make clear which reading texts and (to a significant extent) which grammatical topics will be dealt with, and in which order. In the first nine weeks, teaching will typically begin with comprehension and discussion of a reading text, followed by grammatical instruction and practice, followed by work with the audio-visual materials. As the semester develops, attention will be devoted to linguistic issues which emerge from students' work both in class and in homework exercises, partly with an eye to the grammar test. Weeks 12 and 13 will be devoted to the film \"Der sch￶öne Tag\" with the aim of moving from comprehension and recapitulation to analysis and expression of opinion; the work done in Weeks 12 and 13 will be examined (together with linguistic competence) in the oral interview.",
