Students have a choice of two topics (see below), but will generate their own essay title and content based on original research (interview and data analysis) matched with research in the academic literature (anthropology articles, books, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Topic 1: Economics </strong>Interview a close friend or relative about their ideas related to economics; trade, money, value, labour, or some other aspect of economic life. In the essay you will consider a broader question about socio-economic life, using the results of this interview. How does the data from the interview reflect/contrast with broader sociocultural and/or historical conditions or realities? Re-consider the lecture and relevant reading material from the course. Your essay must include a kinship diagram in which you 'map' any connections between members of the family to which your interviewee refers (for example, if you were interested in the lines of inheritance of material wealth, the values in a family business, or the labour choices among family members). Your essay must also reference at least 3 academic anthropological sources such as journal articles, book chapters, or books. The essay must <em>conclude with a question or tentative finding</em> about the economic matters you investigated. </p>\n<p><strong>Topic 2: Politics </strong>Interview a close friend or relative about political (or apolitical!) views, political party membership, activism, experience of working in bureaucracy or some other aspect of political life. In the essay you will tell a story with the results of this interview. How does the data from the interview reflect/contrast with broader sociocultural and/or historical conditions or realities? Your essay must include a kinship diagram in which you 'map' the connections between any members of the family to which your interviewee refers (for example, if you were interested in political party membership, traditions of activism among family members, or opposing views within a family group). Your essay must also reference at least 3 academic anthropological sources such as journal articles, book chapters, or books. The essay must <em>conclude with a question or tentative finding</em> about the political matters you investigated. </p>\n<p>Assessment</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>'Coded'/analysed notes of own data (interview): 10% (max two pages)</strong> The sample of Coded notes must be submitted at the same time as the essay and in the same document. Students receive training on how to code their notes (see online workshop 5) and guidance in tutorials. Coded notes MUST include references to at least 3 relevant (anthropological) pieces of literature .<em> Coded notes will be submitted via TurnitIn at the same time as the essay and in the same document.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Essay (max 1500 words): 35%</strong> All essays must include a title, your name, student number, page numbers, and be in Times New Roman 12 pt font. Essays must be properly referenced in APA (7) style, with at least 3 anthropology sources.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Follow these instructions:</p>\n<p>Step 1: Consider the reading material from the course on 'Politics' (week 9) or 'Economics' (week 6). Make a decision to investigate EITHER economics or politics (see below). Step 2: Write some interview questions and undertake a short (roughly 30-60 min) interview <em>with a friend or family member</em> on the topic. Step 3: Collate the notes you took during the interview or make notes using the audio recording and/or transcript of your interview. Step 4: analyse your notes, using the process of 'coding' (see online workshop 5). Then, using the keywords that arise ('codes') in the process of this coding, Step 5: engage in research in the anthropological literature to find anthropological papers which help you 'make sense' of and discuss the themes. The final essay you write will combine your data (from the interview) and the anthropological literature from the course outline and your research to help you make sense of what your interviewee tells you in relation to either economics or politics. The essay will include an appendix that provides a sample (no more than 2 pages) of your analysed data ('Coded notes'). </p>\n<p>The Final Essay assessment (+ coded notes) must be submitted by Friday, Week 13 at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard Ultra for this course.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is not encouraged for this task.
