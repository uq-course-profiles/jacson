Ideally, this will build on the provisional research in your Plan, but if you want to change direction then that is fine. (A comparison of Locke and Pufendorf is excluded as a possible topic since this is the subject of the model.)</p>\n<p>Bring two hardcopies of your Report on the day, one to give to the marker. (You will need to submit a copy to Turnitin on the same day so that the wordcount can be verified.) You will then walk the examiner through your argument (6-8 minutes; an alarm will sound at 7 minutes). You should be prepared to answer short questions along the way.</p>\n<p>This presentation is a pass/fail hurdle (50%) that ensures that the course's learning objectives have been achieved. The oral response will be recorded. The quality of your speech (i.e. eloquence) forms no part of the grade or marking process, which rests solely on the quality of your arguments not the manner of their presentation. Criteria are available on Blackboard. </p>\n<p>If the student receives less than 50%, then an overall grade of 3 is awarded for the course (marginal fail or ‘S’ = Supplementary) for the course. The student can apply for a supplementary assessment (see <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=184\">Assessment Procedure</a> – Section 3 Part J).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Research Tips:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It will be important to clarify the target of enlightenment to yourself, e.g. individual, society, state, nation, ruling elite, masses, or whatever, as this will likely be crucial to the comparison. </li>\n<li>Carefully reading and mastering your primary sources is the major burden that the task imposes, not the actual writing, so <strong>adjust your work timetable accordingly!</strong> Secondary texts should only be used sparingly and excellent presentations may not use them at all.</li>\n<li>As you will practise in tutorials, this task requires treating the original language and its meaning with historical sensitivity. For example, if you translate Locke's \"property in his own person\" into \"liberal rights\" then you have not handled his text with historical sensitivity! </li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
