You will receive a different weekly prompt during each tutorial. Your best 6 scores will be counted toward your final grade. The logbooks will ask you to reflect on what you learned in the lecture, tutorial, peer workshops and/or in your own reading for that week's topic ie characterisation, plotting, building tension.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n<p><em>These reflections help you:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consolidate what you learned in that week’s lecture, tutorial and peer workshopping sessions.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate the changes or adjustments you made to your practice or thinking</li>\n<li>Build employability skills in rapid analysis, critical thinking, insight generation, concise writing and academic reflection</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Handwritten in class</li>\n<li>Template provided</li>\n<li>Tutorial prompt given on the day</li>\n<li>You will have 20 minutes for each reflection</li>\n<li>Approx. 200-300 words in total</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each weekly response is marked out of <strong>5%</strong></li>\n<li>6 highest-scoring reflections contribute to the final 30%</li>\n<li>Marking focuses on:</li>\n<li>Insight and depth of thinking</li>\n<li>Quality of analysis and reflection</li>\n<li>Engagement with lecture/tutorial/workshopping content</li>\n<li>Application of learning to your own writing</li>\n<li>Completion of all parts of the weekly prompt</li>\n<li>I'll go through logbook results during selected tutorials</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your active participation in peer workshopping is essential and forms part of your overall learning and development in this course. The in-person weekly reflection logbook requires you to show how workshopping is helping you improve your own writing. You will submit a longer version of this same draft as your final submission. Note: This assessment has a pass/fail hurdle.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Workshopping Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>You will submit a draft of your creative work for peer workshopping early in the course (up to 1,000 words). In return, you will also read and workshop your peers’ drafts. This is a weekly requirement and an important part of developing your craft.</p>\n<p>The set reading list for this course is intentionally short to ensure you have sufficient time each week to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read your peers’ work carefully</li>\n<li>Provide thoughtful, constructive feedback</li>\n<li>Apply feedback you receive to your own revisions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>If you have an SAPD that allows changes to this assessment, please contact me directly at the <strong>start</strong> of semester.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task is to be completed in-person, weekly.
