You must submit a podcast in order to pass the course.</p>\n<p>Podcast topic sign-up is on a first-in basis via Blackboard. Sign-up opens in Week 1. Please choose your topic by the end of Week 3. If you have not signed up for a topic by the end of Week 3, you will be randomly allocated to one of the remaining available topics. If you need to change your topic after Week 3, you will need to write to the course coordinators to request a change (subject to availability).</p>\n<p><strong>Please note: </strong>If you choose a Greek topic for your podcast assignment, you must choose a Roman topic for your essay in the final exam, and vice versa: if you choose a Roman podcast topic, your exam essay must be on a Greek topic. Failure to do so will result in a mark of 0 for the exam essay.</p>\n<p>You must submit your podcast as an MP4 video file. You must also submit a written transcript, including references and bibliography, through Turnitin. Your references and bibliography must follow the style set out in the Classics and Ancient History Study Guide and Study Videos. It is recommended that you do not use AI in researching or writing your essay and any AI use must be referenced.</p>\n<p>A reading list for each topic can also be found in the Tutorial Programme. You are encouraged to conduct your own research beyond the items listed. Further guidance on researching, writing, and recording your podcast assignment will be provided on Blackboard and in class.</p>\n<p>As this is an Ancient History course, your podcast will be assessed on content rather than technical production. However, you are welcome to use your creativity and incorporate ‘interviews’ with the parties or advocates, illustrations, sound effects, etc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
