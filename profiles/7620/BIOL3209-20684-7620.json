The assessment is designed to assess understanding of assigned readings and the week's learning material, and to keep students on track for successfully incorporating biodiversity and systematics concepts. Quizzes are administered via Learn.UQ or via paper-copy during lectures. They are to be done in-person during class.</p>\n<p>There are 13 quizzes but only the best 9 scores will be included in your final mark. Each will be equally weighted and averaged for your final score. This means you can miss several quizzes wthout needing a medical certificate, but if you miss more you should contact the course coordinator.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
