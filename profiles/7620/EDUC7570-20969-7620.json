These tasks will require you to critically reflect on the relationship between theory and practice.</p>\n<p>Each tutorial task includes a brief oral presentation (approximately 5 minutes) in groups of four. Groups may use whiteboards or physical materials to illustrate their ideas. In addition, each group member will respond individually to one question about the task to demonstrate their understanding.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>TUTORIAL TASK 1:</strong></p>\n<p>Using the provided student assessment data, demonstrate your ability to identify where a student is in their learning and design an introductory lesson at an appropriate level aligned with the curriculum.
