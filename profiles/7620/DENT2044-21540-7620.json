The infographic should effectively convey scientific information in an engaging manner.</p>\n<p>Following the creation of the infographic, you are required to submit it via Blackboard using the assignment link provided (accessible three weeks before the due date). Additionally, you will present your findings during a designated session, strictly adhering to a 3-minute time limit. Attendance is strongly encouraged, as this not only facilitates comprehension of peers' presentations but also enhances your overall understanding of the subject matter for optimal performance in the final exam.</p>\n<p>This assessment serves a dual purpose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Evaluate your proficiency in critically assessing arguments and integrating evidence from peer-reviewed literature and other relevant sources to support your own perspective.</li>\n<li>Assess your capability to articulate scientific concepts accurately and engagingly. This is to be demonstrated through the creation of an oral health infographic and the verbal explanation of a concept within the fields of oral microbiology and immunology.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This presentation will be recorded and retained as per university policy.
