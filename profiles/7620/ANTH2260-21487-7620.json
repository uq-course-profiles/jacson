            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>This assessment requires you to present a short reflection in class about your own positionality in relation to your work goals. The reflection should be a maximum of 5 minutes long and must cover the following points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce yourself and explain your work/career goals</li>\n<li>Explain how you will use what you learn in anthropology to achieve these goals. Make reference to readings and/or lecture slides about applied anthropology to contextualise your work/career aspirations in relation to the example of people like Genevieve Bell, Gillian Tett, as well as the guest speakers you have heard from in seminars. What kinds of content knowledge/skills/theory from anthropology is relevant to your goals?</li>\n<li>Critically reflect on your own positionality and its relevance to your goals. Positionality refers to how your culture, identity, and position in society shape your experience of the world, how you perceive others, and how others perceive you. Depending on your positionality, you may wish to reflect on the benefits and/or challenges of conducting anthropological research in an Indigenous community as an Indigenous person (if you are Indigenous). Alternatively, you may wish to reflect on conducting research with Indigenous people as an Australian citizen who is non-Indigenous, or as a non-citizen who is Indigenous in another setting (e.g., a Native American working in Australia), or as a person with another background and heritage. You may wish to consider your gender, class or religious background or belief system, your cultural and educational background or ethnicity, work experience, the languages you speak, whether you have a rural or urban background, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the focus of this course, you are encouraged to engage with your positionality particularly in relation to 'Indigenous territories'. Please note, there is no right or wrong answer to this question. You will instead be marked on your ability to critically reflect on your positionality in relation to the experience of working as an anthropologist. You do not have to be comprehensive about your positionality, but should focus on one or two aspects of it. To prepare for this assessment, you should reflect on the different contexts in which you may work in the future, and the ways in which your positionality may have benefits and/or challenges in different contexts. Different aspects of your positionality may well come to shape your work in different ways, particularly your work with Indigenous peoples, and this assessment is asking you to start to think about how you will manage this, and to share your thoughts with the class. This is intended to assess your developing capacity for reflexivity and professional self-understanding, rather than polished performance or scripted responses.</p>\n<p>Please note: according to University policy, student presentations must be recorded and stored in the event that students ask for a re-mark. In keeping with this policy, presentations will be audio recorded and stored in a secured folder on the University server. Presentations will be deleted from this folder after 1 year.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard Ultra for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. Any use of AI tools in preparing this reflection (e.g., for brainstorming or structuring ideas) must be declared by identifying the model used (e.g., ChatGPT5.2) and sequence of prompts used. Please note that this assessment requires you to articulate and explain your own positionality in real time. You will be questioned about your reflection and must be able to explain and expand on your position without reference to AI-generated material. Inability to do so may affect the mark awarded.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

This assessment has two parts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part A: In-Field Preliminary Reflection (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>Immediately following the field trip, you will be given <strong>one hour</strong> to write a short preliminary reflection based on your observations from the field. This reflection is intended to capture your initial observations, questions, and uncertainties <em>before</em> they are shaped by later discussion, reading, or writing.</p>\n<p>This task assesses your attentiveness in the field and your capacity to begin thinking anthropologically <em>in situ</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>For your in-field reflection, you must</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>record key observations you made during the field trip;</li>\n<li>note any moments of uncertainty, tension, or ambiguity you noticed;</li>\n<li>identify one or two questions that arose for you in relation to Indigenous presence, absence, authority, recognition, or representation;</li>\n<li>briefly reflect on how your own positionality may have shaped what you noticed or did not notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conditions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This task will be completed <strong>in person</strong>, immediately following the field trip.</li>\n<li>The reflection will be <strong>handwritten</strong>.</li>\n<li>You may not use generative AI tools during this task. You must put your phone away and not look at it for the duration of this hour.</li>\n<li>Your reflection will be submitted at the end of the one-hour period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: you are not expected to produce a polished or complete analysis at this stage. Notes, bullet points, and sketches are acceptable.</p>\n<p>This task will be <strong>due the same day as the field trip, exactly 1 hour</strong> after the conclusion of the field activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Part B: Field-Based Professional Advisory Memo (30%)</strong></p>\n<p>This part of the assessment requires you produce a short professional memo based on your field observations, seminars, and course readings. The memo simulates advisory work undertaken by applied anthropologists when working in urban contexts where Indigenous presence, absence, authority, recognition, and representation are complex and often contested.</p>\n<p>You are not being asked to provide a comprehensive cultural history. Instead, the task assesses your ability to identify an issue arising during the field trip and to analyse its implications using concepts, ethics, and methods from applied anthropology.</p>\n<p><strong>In your memo, you must</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify a field-based issue, uncertainty, or point of tension you observed during the field trip relating to Indigenous presence, absence, authority, recognition, and representation. You should draw on your in-field preliminary reflection as a starting point for this analysis.</li>\n<li>Analyse the issue by drawing on concepts, readings, and seminar discussions from the course (e.g., about applied anthropology and its history with Indigenous peoples; ethics; Indigenous authority, culture, and law and custom; native title and recognition)</li>\n<li>Reflect on your positionality and the ethical and epistemic limits on what can and cannot be known, represented, or recommended in this context. You should demonstrate awareness of how applied anthropologists work with incomplete, contested, or constrained information.</li>\n<li>Propose one interpretative or engagement response that addresses the issue identified. Your recommendations should address processes (such as consultation pathways, interpretative caution, further inquiry) and avoid definitive claims about culture.</li>\n<li>Include a <strong>field evidence appendix</strong> that documents the field-based material informing your memo. This may include excerpts from your in-field preliminary reflection; brief field notes from the field trip; annotated sketches, maps, or photographs; notes from the field trip debrief seminar. This appendix should demonstrate what you noticed in the field rather than provide further analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Word limits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In-Field Preliminary Reflection: no word limit</li>\n<li>Professional Advisory Memo: maximum 1,000 words</li>\n<li>Field Evidence Appendix: maximum 800 words.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard Ultra for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' ability to make professional judgements grounded in shared field experience. AI tools may be used for preliminary preparation, e.g., to organise notes or undertake coding. The <strong>use of AI tools to generate field evidence is prohibited and may constitute student misconduct</strong> under the Student Code of Conduct. Students MUST be able to explain and defend their analysis with reference to specific field observations and your in-field preliminary reflection.</p>\n<p><strong>Fieldtrip participation and alternative written examination: </strong></p>\n<p>This course includes a field-based learning activity that forms the basis of Assessment 3. Participation is expected, as it provides essential shared field experience that cannot be replicated in the classroom. Students who are unable to attend the field trip will not be able to complete the field-based assessment and will instead be required to sit an alternative written examination assessing the same learning outcomes. The alternative assessment is not a substitute for the field trip experience but provides an alternative means of demonstrating course learning outcomes. Students who undertake the exam will complete a field-method simulation under exam conditions. They will be provided with curated field materials (eg., photographs, excerpts of field notes, archival documents) and required to analyse them using participant observation, interviewing and cultural mapping as methodological frameworks. While they will not undertake direct observation, they will demonstrate applied understanding of these methods and their limits in Indigenous research contexts.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
