(Primary data collection is not required.)</li>\n<li>Apply at least two relevant consumer behaviour concepts or theories covered in this course to explain or influence the behaviour. Additional theories may be used if relevant.</li>\n<li>Propose 2–3 actionable, theory-driven strategies that marketers could use to influence the selected behaviour.</li>\n<li>Briefly describe possible business, social and policy implications resulting from a change in this behaviour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>AI Statement: </strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
