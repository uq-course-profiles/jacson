The presentation should demonstrate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>an integrated understanding of the client's neuropsychological profile (diagnosis/presenting condition)</li>\n<li>a single cognitive domain for rehabilitation (e.g., attention, executive function, memory social cognition) with rationale for choice and mechanisms underlying impairment (e.g., working memory load, inhibitory control) and linking to real-world functional difficulties, and </li>\n<li>rehabilitation goals (specific to the cognitive domain) and plan (the proposed approach e.g., restorative, compensatory), specific technique(s) used (e.g., errorless learning, goal management training), the influence of wider factors (e.g., insight, motivation, learning capacity), and evaluation strategy to monitor outcomes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With only 20 mins, you need to plan your time to ensure you cover all components </p>\n<p>Assessment criteria:</p>\n<p>0-5:     Neuropsychological profile lacks detail; poor understanding of underlying cognitive mechanisms underlying presentation; inappropriate cognitive domain for treatment lacking rationale for choice; lacking appropriate goals, plan, and evaluation strategy; and minimal response to questions</p>\n<p>6-10:   Basic (undeveloped) neuropsychological profile and understanding of cognitive mechanisms; limited rationale for cognitive treatment, and underspecified goals, domain application to formulation and treatment of neuropsychological disorders; and limited response to questions.</p>\n<p>11-15: A clear and coherent neuropsychological profile supported by a good understanding of cognitive mechanisms, with few gaps in knowledge; a clear evidence-informed rationale for treatment domain and approach; detailed goals, plan and evaluation strategy; and considered response to questions.</p>\n<p>16-20: Excellent and thorough understanding of the client's presentation and cognitive mechanisms underlying presentation; insightful and well-argued rationale for treatment domain and approach; clearly specified goals, plan and evaluation strategy; and responses se to questions shows an excellent understanding of the client's case. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Reflection </strong>(500 words; 10% weighting): This assignment requires students to write a short reflection on one rehabilitation technique, process, or approach used in their case presentation, that draws both on the student’s own reflections on the case and those arising from questions and commentary following the presentation. This is not a description task; the focus is on <strong>critical reflection and learning</strong>.</p>\n<p>Your reflection piece should include: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>a brief description of the chosen technique/process and its role in the case, </li>\n<li>why it is appropriate for your client, with consideration of theory or evidence to support its application and </li>\n<li>reflection on the potential strengths and limitations of the approach</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Assessment criteria</p>\n<p>0-5:     Poor reflection with limited (if any) learning or self-awareness; reflection lacks integration with theory/evidence; failure to consider strengths and weaknesses of approach used; poorly written and structured narrative and/or outside of word count.   </p>\n<p>6-10:   Basic, more descriptive, reflection demonstrating an underdeveloped sense of learning and self-awareness; limited integration of theory/evidence into reflection; undeveloped consideration of strengths and weaknesses of approach; and poorly structured narrative and/or outside of word limit. </p>\n<p>11-15: Clear and coherent reflection with a good understanding of the learning and self-awareness gained; Solid integration of theory/evidence into reflection; a good understanding of the strengths and limitations of the approach used; well written and structured with only minor issues and within the word count    </p>\n<p>16-20: Excellent and insightful critical reflection demonstrating learning and self-awareness; clear integration of theory/evidence into reflection; fully integrated analysis of strengths and limitations of approach and its appropriateness to the case; clearly written and structured reflection within the word count.    </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
