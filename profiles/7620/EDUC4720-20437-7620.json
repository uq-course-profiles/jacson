Your unit plan needs to be based on the teaching and learning cycle and draw on contemporary curriculum frameworks. Your unit plan needs to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contextual considerations (e.g., your students – prior experiences/knowledge); the school setting/context/priorities/imperatives)</li>\n<li>Curriculum connections (i.e., English Content Descriptions, other Learning Areas, Cross Curriculum Priorities, General Capabilities)</li>\n<li>Learning goals, learning experiences, teaching strategies and assessment approaches to expand learning opportunities for all students including those with English as an Additional Language or dialect (EAL/D) and diverse backgrounds.</li>\n<li>Resources both traditional and online and including ICT to engage all students in their learning and support teaching (e.g., literary &amp; non-literary texts, kits, videos)</li>\n<li>Conceptual links (e.g.., Four Resources Model; Multiliteracies Pedagogy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your response will reflect your knowledge and understanding of the course content and relevant research, curriculum and policy documents as derived from the readings, lectures and tutorials.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions to Scaffold Unit Plan Development</strong></p>\n<p>Answers to the following questions may assist critical alignment among knowledge of curriculum, teaching, student learning and assessment as well as decision-making about planning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What content will enthuse/interest/motivate your students? Why? (relevance to students/English Curriculum/EAL/D students and students from diverse backgrounds)</li>\n<li>What are your goals for student learning? Why?</li>\n<li>How will your goals, learning experiences and teaching strategies expand learning opportunities for all students?</li>\n<li>What texts will you select to build/deepen knowledge and promote substantive classroom/student conversations?</li>\n<li>How will you select and use resources to engage all students in their learning?</li>\n<li>What concepts/frameworks will inform your thinking about planning?</li>\n<li>How will students demonstrate their learning and achievement throughout the unit? (What outcome tasks will students produce and what assessment strategies – formal/informal, diagnostic, summative – will you use throughout the unit to enable student learning?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will present/display your group unit plan on one side of an A3 sheet of paper (references may be listed overleaf using the required APA style). Font size must be no smaller than 11. The nature of planning documents calls for economic use of words and space hence well-constructed notes/dot points are expected and appropriate exploitation of layout, headings, colour, tables, codes etc. is encouraged.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>PART 2</strong> (25%)</p>\n<p>Based on your group’s unit plan for an allocated year level in the primary school, you will develop a coherent sequence of three lessons. These lessons need to provide evidence of explicit teaching of key concepts in two of the following areas of the English Curriculum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading comprehension</li>\n<li>Guided writing</li>\n<li>Functional grammar</li>\n<li>Vocabulary development</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Your lesson sequence needs to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student learning goals and lesson objectives</li>\n<li>Teaching strategies that support inclusive student participation and engagement</li>\n<li>Teaching strategies that include using ICT to expand curriculum learning for students</li>\n<li>Classroom organisation and management information</li>\n<li>Resources including ICT to engage all students in their learning</li>\n<li>A range of suitable assessment approaches – including formal/informal, diagnostic, summative – to assess student learning</li>\n<li>Ways to differentiate learning and teaching to cater for students with EAL/D and diverse backgrounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
