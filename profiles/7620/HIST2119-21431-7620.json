Speak to the class from your notes, rather than read from them.</p>\n<p>4. Presentations should be done with enthusiasm! Be upbeat, but not casual.</p>\n<p>5. Presentations should be intellectually stimulating and entertaining.</p>\n<p>6. Focus on the main points. Don't go into too much detail. A presentation is not a research essay.</p>\n<p>7. Presentations should be based on the assigned readings as well as other scholarly sources related to the topic.</p>\n<p>8. Presentations should be well-structured: a clear introduction; two or three key points; and a clear conclusion.</p>\n<p>9. A brief introduction and conclusion to your talk are important. Give them some thought.</p>\n<p>10. Nervousness is normal! Use it to enhance your presentation.</p>\n<p>11. Anyone can be a good public speaker.
