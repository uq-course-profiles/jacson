Instructions on how to create or join a group in Blackboard will be provided in Week 1. Groups will be formed in Week 1–2. Students who do not have a group may use the Blackboard group tool (and tutorial class time) to connect with others, and teaching staff can assist in matching students where possible. Students must be in a group by the end of Tutorial Session 2; students who have not joined a group by this date will be allocated to a group.</p>\n<p>Each group will be allocated one functional component (e.g., fibre, calcium, polyphenols). Across Tutorial Sessions 2–6, groups will research the assigned component and identify four different market products that contain it (one product per student).</p>\n<p>Tutorial time will support planning and coordination; however, additional meetings outside scheduled classes are expected. The instructor will be available during tutorials to answer questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Submission and timing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poster submission:</strong> Only <strong>one group member</strong> needs to submit the poster on behalf of the group via the relevant Turnitin link on Blackboard by <strong>02/04/2026, 16:00</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Presentations:</strong> Delivered during tutorial sessions in <strong>Weeks 7–10</strong>. <strong>The presentation timetable will be availble on Blackboard in Week 4.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Details of the Poster Presentation assessment are outlined below:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part A: Functional component overview </strong></p>\n<p>Each group will investigate the assigned functional component and include the following on the poster:</p>\n<p>1)    What the functional component is (definition);</p>\n<p>2)    Why it is considered functional in foods; and</p>\n<p>3)    Key health benefit(s) and a brief, clear health mechanism (a simple diagram is encouraged).</p>\n<p><strong>Part B: Product (one product per student)</strong></p>\n<p>Each group member must identify one different market product that contains the assigned functional component and provide a product summary on the poster that includes:</p>\n<p>1)    Product name and product category;</p>\n<p>2)    Serving size (as stated on pack);</p>\n<p>3)    Functional component amount per serve (if stated), OR a numeric proxy if not stated (e.g., % cocoa, % wholegrain, % fruit/berry, quantified ingredient %);</p>\n<p>4)    A brief explanation of why the ingredient is functional and the health mechanism (short and specific);</p>\n<p>5)    A justification for why the product is a strong vehicle for health benefit delivery (e.g., formulation/food matrix, portion realism, consumer use context); and</p>\n<p>6)     One limitation (e.g., sugar/sodium load, low dose, processing, allergens, cost).</p>\n<p>Presentation verification requirement: During your pitch, each student must briefly show the product label (pack or label image) and point to where the functional component is evidenced on-pack (Nutrition Information Panel, ingredients list, or a quantified claim). This is to ensure product-specific analysis and individual ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Part C: Product comparison and final recommendation </strong></p>\n<p>The group should compare the four products using a decision matrix and select the best product. This section must include:</p>\n<p>1)    A decision matrix comparing all four products using the criteria below; and</p>\n<p>2)    The group’s final choice: best product + 2–3 lines justification explaining why it provides the strongest potential health benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision matrix criteria (all groups must use these)</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Strength of functional component dose/indicator (label-based)</li>\n<li>Mechanism alignment (does the product plausibly deliver the effect?)</li>\n<li>Portion realism (is the serving size realistic for consumers?)</li>\n<li>Practicality (availability, cost, allergens/diet suitability)</li>\n<li>Limitations (e.g., sugar/sodium/processing concerns)</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Poster format and submission requirements </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Submission:</strong> Submit a <strong>two-page PDF</strong> as a single file via <strong>Blackboard/Turnitin</strong>. <strong>Only one group member</strong> needs to upload the file on behalf of the group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page 1:</strong> A1 poster (all main content must be on this page)</li>\n<li><strong>Page 2:</strong> References only (no additional figures, tables, or content)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Poster presentation (Tutorial) - Weeks 7-10</strong></p>\n<p>Each group will deliver a poster presentation during the tutorial session, based on the poster they have submitted.</p>\n<p>Format: One group pitch based on the poster</p>\n<p>Duration: 8 minutes total (timed)</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended structure of presentation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group introduction</li>\n<li>Each student presents their own product section</li>\n<li>Group decision matrix + best product recommendation + key takeaway</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Peer Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Each group member will evaluate the contribution of the other members to the poster and preparation for the presentation using the course peer assessment tool on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) tools, successful completion of the assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI or MT will provide only limited support and guidance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission, independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be acknowledged appropriately.
