These areas accommodate text, images and tables as necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Word limit: </strong>Unless specified for a particular question, there is no set word limit per question or overall. Aim for concise, complete and well-supported responses.</li>\n<li><strong>Referencing: </strong>You do not need to cite UQ Extend content, but for other sources use <strong>APA 7th style</strong> for in-text citations (placed after each response or sub-section response) and provide a full reference list at the end of the assignment. Use authoritative, verifiable sources (e.g., peer-reviewed literature, standard reference texts, regulatory/guideline documents).

However, the scientific content, analysis and interpretation must be your own.</li>\n<li><strong>AI acknowledgement: </strong>You must include an AI use acknowledgement statement beneath the assignment title in your submission, clearly indicating whether AI tools were used. <strong><em>Example 1 (AI used): </em></strong><em>This assignment was developed with the assistance of AI tool(s) [name(s) of the AI tools()] used for idea generation and language editing. All final content, patient communication messages, and clinical information are our own. </em><strong><em>Example 2 (no AI used): </em></strong><em>This assignment was completed without the use of AI tools.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Record-keeping:</strong> If you use AI tools, you must be able to provide documentation on request demonstrating your process and contribution. Keep a record of all prompts entered, AI-generated outputs, and the tools used. You do not need to submit this record with your assignment, but you may be asked to provide it to verify your process.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrity requirements: </strong>Your use of AI must uphold UQ's Academic Integrity Policy and Student Code of Conduct. Failure to acknowledge AI use or overreliance on AI-generated material may constitute academic misconduct. Do not use AI to fabricate references or unverifiable claims, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of all content and citations.</li>\n<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use AI as a learning aid, not a substitute for you clinical reasoning or communication skills.
