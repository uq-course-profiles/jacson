The notebook will include annotated drawings, sketches, diagrams, and written explanations describing material properties, structural behaviour, assembly methods, and real‑world examples. Where possible, dimensions should be added. This assessment strengthens observational skills and reinforces students’ ability to communicate constructional understanding using architectural drawing conventions.</p>\n<p>All drawings, sketches and diagrams must be completed by hand using analogue tools and submitted as a single bound document of A3 format (landscape). The digital copy must to be submitted in .PDF format (with sufficient resolution of carefully scanned drawings) as a single document. Annotations, notes observations, and photographs can be added digitally. Handwritten notes must be legible.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
