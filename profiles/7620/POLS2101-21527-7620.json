When enquiring into Indigenous politics and policy it is therefore important to understand how these things are framed by non-Indigenous ideas and knowledges. This assessment task teaches us to see this framing - and how it structures what we know, rather than simply operating within that framing and so replicating its outcomes. This task develops the skills you will need for the Issues Analysis assessment.</p>\n<p>A short paper critique (SPC) is a highly focussed analysis of a text that addresses its structural framing rather than its content. Unlike other critical analyses short paper critiques do not address the argument made in a text, but identify the framing that allows that argument to be made.
