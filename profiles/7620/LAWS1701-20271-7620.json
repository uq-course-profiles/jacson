Each Part will contribute 10% to your overall course grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Part A: IN-CLASS PEER-MARKING TASK (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>Part A will take place during Week 4 tutorials. Students are required to bring a <strong>hard copy </strong>of their pre-prepared response to the tutorial question. During the tutorial, responses will be distributed among students. Each student will anonymously assess another student's response against the course criteria. At the end of the tutorial, the marked responses will be returned to their original authors.</p>\n<p><strong>Purposes of Part A</strong></p>\n<p>This exercise is designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop students' legal writing skills;</li>\n<li>enhance understanding and application of the assessment criteria; and</li>\n<li>promote active participation in tutorials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students must attend the tutorial for which they are enrolled. Students will be marked off the roll for that tutorial.</li>\n<li>Students must bring valid personal identification, including evidence of their UQ student number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students who attend and actively participate in the marking and feedback exercise will receive the full 10% allocated for Part A.</p>\n<p>Active participation requires bringing a hard copy of your own response and completing the marking and feedback process during your tutorial.</p>\n<p>Failure to attend, failure to bring your own response, or failure to participate will result in zero marks for Part A.</p>\n<p><strong>PART B: SELF-REFLECTION AND REVISION TASK (10%) </strong></p>\n<p>Reflecting on what you learned in the Week 4 tutorial and the feedback you received, you are required to revise your answer to the tutorial question. Your revised work should show that you have engaged with the tutorial discussion and feedback, and have critically reflected on the content of your original response. You should aim for your revised response to be a clear and relevant improvement from your original response. Specifically, you should reflect on and make improvements to the following:</p>\n<p>·        identification of the relevant issues;</p>\n<p>·        articulation of the relevant law;</p>\n<p>·        application and analysis;</p>\n<p>·        strength of your conclusion;</p>\n<p>·        communication, including clarity of expression and structure.</p>\n<p>You must then submit both your <strong>original response </strong>and your<strong> revised response </strong>on Blackboard. Your revised response must be in mark-up (‘track changes’) so that we can see the changes you have made.</p>\n<p>You must include a completed AI Assignment Coversheet with your submission. Failure to do so may constitute academic misconduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Due date for Part B</strong>: 2pm Friday 27 March.</p>\n<p>If your revised response shows that you have engaged critically with the tutorial content and made clear and relevant improvements to your original response, you will receive the full 10% for Part B.</p>\n<p>If your revised response shows that you have engaged with the tutorial content and made clear improvements to your original response, you will receive 5% for Part B.</p>\n<p>If your revised response shows that you have not engaged with the tutorial content or have made little or no changes to your original response, you will receive 0% for Part B.</p>\n<p><strong>Word count</strong></p>\n<p>There is no word limit for this task. Your focus should be on the quality of your legal analysis (not on the word count). As a rough guide, your response should be at least 500 words but no more than 1,000 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>You will not receive individual feedback on this task. However, the Course Coordinator will read your revised responses and will release whole-of-cohort feedback, to assist you with subsequent assessment tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Although students are not forbidden to use Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Translation technologies, successful completion of the assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Academic misconduct may become part of a report that UQ <em>must</em> provide to the Legal Practitioners Admissions Board, and this may impact whether you can be admitted to legal practice.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
