Both requirements must be satisfied to earn the marks for the tutorial. Tutorial participation requires active listening, constructive participation, and engaging in tutorial activities. In order to make this possible, students are required to do the weekly readings.</p>\n<p>To gain an additional 2 marks, during the last week of tutorials, students will be required to submit a 300 word reflection overviewing their key takeaways from the lectures and tutorial discussions. This writing must be reflexive and offer an outlook for the future. An example format could be:</p>\n<p>Paragraph 1 (reflection): Outline what you learnt from the course, what - if anything - has challenged your understanding of terrorism and insurgency, and what did you find surprising?</p>\n<p>Paragraph 2 (future outlook): What terrorist/insurgency/violent extremist threat poses the greatest threat, and do you think democracies are equipped to address that threat?</p>\n<p>Submission is via Turnitin. It will not be formally assessed and no feedback will be provided, but it will be checked to ensure you have completed the exercise and are eligible to receive these 2 additional marks. This must be submitted by Friday 8 May at 5pm. Late submissions will not be marked.</p>\n<p><strong>Note well:</strong> If you are unable to attend a tutorial, please ensure you contact your tutor/course coordinator prior to the session. A student can make up the mark for having missed a tutorial by submitting a synopsis on the weekly readings to their tutor <strong>via email</strong> after the tutorial only in the case that this has been previously agreed to due to medical reasons, Student Disability Action Plan, or exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.
