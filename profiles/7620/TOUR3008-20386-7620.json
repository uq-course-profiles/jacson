Your task is to identify a real service experience (positive or negative) that clearly illustrates this concept, and to demonstrate how the concept helps make sense of what happened and why it mattered.</p>\n<p>In Weeks 4 and 5, you will deliver a short (3 minutes), live, in-person pitch to the class. In this pitch, you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Briefly describe the chosen service experience</li>\n<li>Clearly explain the allocated service management concept</li>\n<li>Explicitly connect the concept to the experience, showing how it helps interpret or explain the customer experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary emphasis of the pitch is on clarity and insight, not detail. You should be able to clearly articulate the link between theory and practice within a short time frame and respond to questions from the lecturer and classmates.</p>\n<p>This pitch is not a standalone task. It is designed to help you test and refine your thinking, and it will form the foundation for your Service Experience Report, where you will develop your analysis in greater depth.
