Your literature review should be a concise and critical synthesis of previous research that functions to form a conceptual framework for your project. Your research questions should be informed by your literature review and be answerable if your proposed research project is to be carried out. 3) Methodology, which explains the design of your study, the specific methods chosen appropriate to the research topic and research questions, data collection strategies, and data analysis techniques. You are required to justify decisions made at each step of the research process. You also need to explain how cultural and ethical issues, if applicable, are addressed.

However, you are allowed to work on a project for Assessment 3, which is different from that of your Assessment 1, if you wish to.
