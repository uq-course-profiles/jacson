These run from week 3 to 12 of semester and involve presentations by people affected by mental disorders who provide a personal account of their lived experience of mental health difficulties either directly as someone who has a mental disorder, or as a carer of someone with a mental disorder, or as a health professional working with people with mental disorders. Additional videos/written cases of individuals with mental disorders are also shown and you may also write a reflective summary on one or more of these.</p>\n<p>Choose five of these cases across the semester and write a 200-300 word reflective summary on each one and submit via Turnitin. There are two submission dates, the first one is in week 7 where you should submit your first 2 reflective summaries. The second is in week 13 when you should submit your remaining 3 summaries. There will be further details and marking criteria provided in class and on Blackboard to guide you on what to write.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stream B – Reflections on Peer Support using the Sharper Minds mental health modules</p>\n<p>In this stream, you will be introduced to a series of seven hypothetical case studies, each one featuring a university student with the diagnosis from the week’s lecture. You will be asked to work through a specific Sharper Minds online module (taking about 15 minutes) and respond to questions about how you would apply the knowledge and skills from the module to provide peer support for the person in the case study.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Choose five of the modules and write a 200-300 word reflective summary on each one and submit via Turnitin before 2pm on the submission dates listed.
