As such, this is an opportunity to practice designing your path to becoming a wise influencer for your community and society.  </p>\n<p>As a group, you will work together **every week in tutorials** to examine challenges or problems in your community (the university; your home community; Brisbane area). You will decide on a specific challenge and design an initiative to address or solve the problem.

You will give each other feedback on how to improve the project / presentation (5% of final grade)</p>\n<p>You will present your final proposal to class (30% of final grade).
