You must bring a copy of the relevant text (e-copies are acceptable) and any additional material to every tutorial, and you must have read them at least once. Attendance itself is not sufficient to constitute 'participation'. Participation means willing involvement, active engagement with the text and the tasks at hand, asking questions, working well in groups, and demonstrating evidence of having listened to the lectures. To receive full marks, your tutor will need to see evidence of you having engaged with this full spectrum of activity.</p>\n<p><strong>For the final 1% of your weekly mark between weeks 2 and 11</strong>, you will write 100 words in class, responding to a specific prompt that draws on the lecture content and set texts (critical and performance). Some responses will require responses to visual and/or audio-visual material, and you will be provided with a worksheet to write on.</p>\n<p><strong>Up to an additional 3%</strong> of marks is available for responding to a written prompt on a provided worksheet in the week 13 lecture. This may consist of short-answer questions of up to 100 words.</p>\n<p>Acting ability is not assessed. It is your responsibility to ensure that your attendance has been recorded. </p>\n<p>If you are absent from your tutorial through documented illness or other documented circumstances beyond your control, and supply this documentation to your tutor, you will receive a pass mark (in the range of a four) for that week. You may also be able to respond to the class activities and receive additional marks. Students will receive written feedback each week.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
