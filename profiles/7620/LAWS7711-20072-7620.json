The topics will broadly relate to themes and materials covered in the course. The topics will require students to research and analyse contemporary issues, controversies and developments in the law of armed conflict.</p>\n<p>Using Learn.UQ, students will self-organise into groups with 3-4 members. Each group will choose a topic from the list. Each member of the group must contribute to researching the topic and developing the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation and Q&amp;A</strong></p>\n<p>The course coordinator will schedule presentation sessions in Teaching Week 10. Each session will last for 90-120 minutes to allow 3-4 groups to present. Each group will present to the course coordinator and a small group of students attending the same session. Another staff member may also attend the session and ask questions. The session may be recorded.</p>\n<p>All group members must be present for the session. Group members may share the task of presenting, or choose representatives of the group to present. However, all group members must be prepared to answer questions during the question-and-answer component. Groups may use media to support the presentation, such as slide decks or handouts.</p>\n<p>Every group member will in principle receive the same mark, but the course coordinator reserves the right to reward exceptional individual contributions with additional points.
