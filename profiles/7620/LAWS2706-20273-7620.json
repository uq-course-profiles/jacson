A pass will mean that 1.5 marks will be allocated per tutorial, to a <strong>maximum of 10 marks</strong>. The criterion for passing is whether, in the opinion of your Tutor, you have made<strong> a reasonable and serious attempt to answer the tutorial exercise</strong>. In so doing, students must attempt to: (1) identify the issues raided by the question(s); (2) identify the rules and/or principles relevant to answering the issues; (3) identify and relate to the issues the relevant facts and/or factual assumptions; and (4) raise and address and matters of relevant legal policy were necessary or desirable.</li>\n<li>While collaboration, i.e. oral discussion of the questions, is acceptable, it is expected that any notes submitted for marking will reflect independent thought and judgement. Copying notes from other students is <strong>not acceptable</strong> and may be treated as academic misconduct. If there is genuine collaboration resulting in similar notes, you are advised to indicate the name(s) of your collaborator(s).</li>\n<li>Note that the feedback for this piece of assessment will be the tutorial itself, ie. the one to which the preparation relates. The answers will not be returned with comments, and so students should take the opportunity to raise any questions during the tutorial.</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, a mark out of 10 will be given to each student if, in the overall judgement of the course coordinator, the criteria set out in the course profile have been satisfied.</li>\n<li><strong>Answers cannot be submitted after class, or by email, or by another student on your behalf. </strong>Students must attend the tutorial with their answers and stay for the duration of the tutorial to receive any marks. A student will not obtain a mark for tutorial preparation if she or he does not attend the tutorial group in which she or he is enrolled.</li>\n<li>The maximum mark can be achieved by submitting seven times in the course of the semester. Students can be absent or not prepare<strong> four times </strong>and still gain the full marks for tutorial preparation. This is designed to accommodate emergencies and other reasons for non-preparation. </li>\n<li><strong>Students should not email the Course Coordinator regarding special requests for non-preparation except in the exceptional case where the student is unable to attend tutorials over the entire semester</strong>.</li>\n<li>The tutorial in<strong> Week 1 is not assessable.</strong> Therefore, students cannot submit answers to this tutorial exercise. The content covered in this week's Tutorial is still potentially assessable in the In-Semester and End-of-Semester Examinations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After enrolments close, students will <strong>not</strong> be permitted to change their enrolment in a tutorial <strong>without the written permission of the Course Coordinator.</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=145\">Student Code of Conduct</a>.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
