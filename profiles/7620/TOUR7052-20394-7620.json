            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>This course will make use of an online airline simulation to help you learn about the logistics and operations of passenger transport modes. You will work as part of a <strong>team of five to seven</strong> <strong>students</strong> to create and manage a virtual airline. A <strong>Trial</strong> <strong>Simulation</strong> will run from Weeks 4 to 6 to allow you to familiarise yourself with the online software. The simulation will be reset after Week 6.</p>\n<p>The assessable part of the simulation will commence on Week 7 (<strong>Actual Simulation</strong>)<strong> </strong>and will conclude at the end of Week 12. Each airline will receive $300 million of start-up capital. In the simulation, one week of the semester will represent six months (two quarters) of a financial year. At the end of each week, news items that may impact on the operation of your airline will be circulated. You will need to work on the simulation every week during this time.</p>\n<p>Your team’s performance will be assessed at three stages of the simulation.</p>\n<p>Stage 1               Before the simulation, your team will present a <strong>video proposal</strong> for your airline.</p>\n<p>Stage 2               During the simulation, your team will prepare an <strong>annual report</strong>.</p>\n<p>Stage 3               At the conclusion of the simulation, the <strong>performance</strong> of your airline will be evaluated.</p>\n<p>While simulation assessments will be completed as a group, you will receive individual marks. Your <strong>individual marks</strong> for these tasks will be weighted based on a <strong>peer evaluation</strong> of your contribution to the team. The peer evaluation will be conducted online in Week 13 (by Friday, 5pm) after the simulation has finished. You will be asked to evaluate your own performance and the performance of each of your team members along five dimensions (contribution, quality, attendance, timeliness and overall performance). More details about how this peer evaluation will be calculated are available in the assessment guidelines on the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>You should aim to spend about <strong>4-5 hours</strong> <strong>per week</strong> on the simulation and related assessments between weeks 2-12. This would typically consist of one hour of team meetings to delegate tasks plus three to four hours of individual work per week. In addition to this, some time will also be set aside in class for you to work with your team. </p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
