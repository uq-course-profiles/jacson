This assessment allows you to synthesise and apply the key concepts learned across the course (including digital health system frameworks, interoperability, and health economics principles, among others) to evaluate a contemporary digital health policy or initiative.</p>\n<p>You will prepare a concise, evidence-based analytical policy brief demonstrating your ability to:</p>\n<p>· Apply health economics principles (e.g., scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency and equity trade-offs, demand-supply dynamics) to digital health evaluation.</p>\n<p>· Analyse digital health architecture, data, and workflow integration.</p>\n<p>· Communicate actionable, evidence-based recommendations to policy or clinical decision-makers.</p>\n<p>This task mirrors a real-world policy brief prepared for health departments, digital health agencies, or clinical leadership teams.</p>\n<p>Task description</p>\n<p>Prepare an analytical policy brief evaluating a digital health initiative or policy. Your brief should use an evidence-based approach and apply relevant concepts from the course modules including foundations of digital health, health information systems, data analytics, and economic reasoning. Use the structure below for your report with section headings. Note. The listed bullet points under each section heading serve as guidance only; not all may apply to every topic. You should adapt the focus of your analysis as appropriate to your selected initiative.</p>\n<p>1. Problem definition and context (~250 words):</p>\n<p>· Define the health system problem or policy challenge being addressed.</p>\n<p>· Explain its relevance to the Quadruple Aim (improving patient experience, population health, workforce wellbeing, and cost efficiency).</p>\n<p>· Support your description and significance of the problem with credible data (e.g., AIHW, ABS, OECD, WHO, or relevant academic papers).</p>\n<p>2. Overview of the policy or initiative (~250 words):</p>\n<p>· Describe the initiative’s purpose, scope, and digital health modality (e.g., telehealth, mHealth, AI-enabled decision support).</p>\n<p>· Identify its core technologies, data infrastructure, and target population.</p>\n<p>· Summarise key stakeholders and the governance or regulatory context.</p>\n<p>3. Analytical discussion (~600 words):</p>\n<p>Critically evaluate the initiative/policy using concepts learned in the course. This may include:</p>\n<p>· Economic principles: e.g., scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, equity, demand and supply mechanisms, market failure.</p>\n<p>· Analytical frameworks: e.g., Quadruple Aims, socio-technical systems, diffusion of innovation, and implementation enablers/barriers.</p>\n<p>· Digital health analytical dimensions: e.g., uptake and adoption patterns, user engagement (clinicians, patients, or organisations), and common implementation challenges (e.g., governance, privacy, interoperability, data quality, and workflow integration).</p>\n<p>Where appropriate, include and interpret one figure or table (e.g., adoption trends, cost data, or system outcomes).</p>\n<p>You should demonstrate analytical reasoning (not just description) by interpreting relationships between digital health implementation factors and measurable health system outcomes such as access, quality, efficiency, and equity. The analysis should provide a balanced view of both benefits and limitations, reflecting the complex socio-technical nature of digital health transformation.</p>\n<p>4. Policy options and recommendations (~400 words):</p>\n<p>Building on your analysis, present feasible and evidence-based policy recommendations for improving or scaling the initiative. Your discussion should:</p>\n<p>· Translate analytical insights into specific, actionable options addressing the key barriers and enablers identified (e.g., interoperability, digital literacy, governance, data quality).</p>\n<p>· Compare alternative strategies or models and justify your preferred approach using evidence of effectiveness, adoption, and cost implications.</p>\n<p>· Consider feasibility and implementation factors, including technical readiness, workforce capability, and policy alignment.</p>\n<p>· Discuss the anticipated system-level impacts on access, quality, efficiency, and equity, linking back to your analysis.</p>\n<p>· Provide a concise concluding statement highlighting how your recommendations enhance the initiative’s overall value and sustainability.</p>\n<p>5. References</p>\n<p>· Use APA 7th edition referencing style.</p>\n<p>· References are excluded from the word count.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
