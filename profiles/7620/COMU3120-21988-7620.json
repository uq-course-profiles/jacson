Tutorials are designed to help you explore and understand course material presented in lectures, sometimes through the introduction of additional academic information. Throughout the semester, you will be expected to regularly attend - and actively participate in - your scheduled tutorials. Through tutorial participation, you will enhance your understanding of digital analytics, and demonstrate your understanding of course material through ongoing conversations with your peers and the teaching team.</p>\n<p>Each tutorial is worth 5 points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 points for completing the assigned activities</li>\n<li>3 points for making a meaningful contribution to the tutorial</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The activities required for completion each week will be clearly delineated in the weekly tutorial instructions, posted to Learn. Partial marks will not be given (i.e. you either get the points for completion of the activities or you don't; you either get the points for a meaningful contribution or you don't).</p>\n<p>A 'meaningful contribution' may include, but is not limited to: asking a thoughtful and relevant question; sharing a thoughtful and relevant answer or comment; providing peer feedback; or helping a peer complete the assigned activities if they are struggling. Through your meaningful contribution, you are valuably contributing to the co-creation of knowledge in the class. The presiding tutor will assess whether or not your contribution is meaningful and worthy of points. If your tutor does not observe your meaningful contribution, it will not be counted.</p>\n<p>While you will receive a mark for tutorial participation each week, <strong>only your best six tutorials will be added together to give you a final mark out of 30</strong>. We encourage you to participate in as many tutorials as you are able.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In this assessment, you will identify a single instance when something has not gone right for you in this course. Maybe you got an ‘error’ message. Maybe something was formatted incorrectly. Maybe you just didn’t understand something, or didn't know what to do next. Whatever instance you choose, write a reflection on this experience in 750 words (+/- 10%), excluding references.</p>\n<p>Your reflection must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An introduction to what went wrong: Briefly explain the context of the incident.</li>\n<li>A description of the issue you faced: Describe a single instance of what went wrong. If you understand the reason for the issue now, explain why it happened.</li>\n<li>Actions taken to resolve the issue: Describe how you attempted to solve the problem. If you couldn’t resolve it, explain what you did instead and why.</li>\n<li>What you learned: Explain what this experience taught you about digital analytics. How does this experience connect with concepts and content we have covered in the course? This section is weighted the most strongly, so it should be the primary focus of your submission.</li>\n<li>Conclusion: Briefly summarise the main points of your reflection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are encouraged to use the first-person ‘I’ pronoun in this assessment.</p>\n<p>If images help you more clearly articulate your ideas, you are welcome (but not required) to include them.

You will select your own group. Groups will be finalised in Week 6. You’ll have some tutorial time to work with your group, but most work will be completed outside of regularly-scheduled class time.</p>\n<p>Your group will present all of this assessment's components in a single portfolio. This assessment demonstrates your understanding of key concepts from the course.</p>\n<p>Your portfolio will include six parts:</p>\n<p><strong>(1) A research question: </strong>Choose a specific topic and write one clear research question that will guide your entire portfolio. Your question should be as specific as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Scraped data: </strong>Using the scraping methods covered in class (manual Excel scraping and/or automated scraping in R), create a dataset that can help you answer your research question. For example, if your question relates to increasing property prices in Brisbane, you may wish to scrape data about housing prices on RealEstate.com. As another example, if your question relates to K-pop fan cultures, you may wish to scrape data from Blackpink's YouTube channel. Your dataset must include at least 30 cases and three variables. You must also provide a short explanation (no more than 150 words) of your sampling strategy and why it suits your research question. You must submit your full dataset in a .csv file format. If you used R to scrape your data, you must also submit your full R code, including comments (#) that show your understanding of each coding step.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Descriptive statistics: </strong>Choose one variable from your dataset and report its:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>range</li>\n<li>mean</li>\n<li>median</li>\n<li>mode</li>\n<li>standard deviation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may use Excel or R. Either way, you must specify which functions you used. You must include a short explanation (no more than 150 words) of how these statistics help answer your research question.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Two visualisations made using R: </strong>Using R, create two visualisations that help answer your research question. Include the code for each, with comments (#) that show your understanding of each coding step.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visualisation 1 must be a bar chart made using the barplot() function. </strong>Your bar chart must include: data; a title; axis, variable, and range labels; reasonable scale(s); and a data source.</li>\n<li><strong>Visualisation 2 must be in a form of your choosing. </strong>Choose an appropriate type of visualisation for your data and research question. This visualisation should demonstrate R proficiency and good practice for data visualisations as we have reviewed in class. To make this visualisation, you will need to self-direct your learning using some of the many publicly available R resources. You cannot use the barplot() function a second time, but you can make another bar chart using a different function or package if you feel this is appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each visualisation must include a short explanation (no more than 150 words) of how it helps answer your research question.</p>\n<p><strong>(5) A one-page (A4 size) proposal for a creative data story/presentation. </strong>On a single A4 page, describe a creative way to present your data. You must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the intended audience of your creative data story/presentation, being as specific as possible.</li>\n<li>Explain how your dataset would be used, and how your story/presentation would help others understand your dataset and research question.</li>\n<li>Show your understanding of course concepts and content through your decisions.</li>\n<li>Include in-text reference to at least one required course reading using APA style.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may use just text, or mix of text and images. There is no minimum or maximum word count for this part of the assessment, but everything must fit onto one A4 page. Your idea must be feasible, but you do not need to execute it; you can be as aspirational as you wish.</p>\n<p><strong>(6) References list:</strong> Include at least one required course reading (cited in your creative data story/presentation proposal) and any other sources, unoriginal assets, and/or AI tools you have used.</p>\n<p>A template is provided on Learn to help you compile your portfolio for submission. <strong>Only one member of your group needs to submit on behalf of the entire group.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Peer Evaluation (Buddycheck)</strong>: Peer Evaluation is completed for this assessment item using Buddycheck. Buddycheck is a peer evaluation tool, that calculates student contributions to a group project and enables peer feedback. Information about Buddycheck can be accessed here: <a href=\"https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-ultra/buddycheck-ultra-student\">https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-ultra/buddycheck-ultra-student</a> .</p>\n<p>Using student ratings and feedback, Buddycheck calculates a Peer Assessment Factor (PAF) which is then applied to the group assessment mark. This PAF is a percentage which is multiplied by the group mark to calculate your individual final PAF-adjusted assessment mark. For example, if a group received 25/30 for an assessment and then one member of the group received a 0.9 (90%) for the PAF that student would receive 25 x 0.90 = 22.5 as their final PAF-adjusted assessment mark.</p>\n<p>This Peer Evaluation is summative and will be used to calculate students' final marks for this assessment. If you do not complete the Peer Evaluation, your perception of your contribution to the assessment will be absent from the overall calculation of your contribution to the group work.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
