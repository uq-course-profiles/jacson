Rather than testing content knowledge, this reflection invites you to consider the <em>process</em> of learning to read novels critically and historically.</p>\n<p>Your reflection should address <strong>two of the three prompts</strong> below. You may write in the first person, but your tone should remain academic and focused. The aim is to demonstrate thoughtful engagement with the course, not to summarise the texts or recount personal experiences.</p>\n<p>Write in full paragraphs (not bullet points), and keep your response within the word limit (250 words).</p>\n<p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe one idea, concept, or skill from the course that has significantly shaped the way you read novels. Explain why it matters and briefly illustrate with an example from a text studied this semester.</li>\n<li>Reflect on one tutorial discussion or activity that influenced your understanding of a text or a narrative technique. Explain how it changed, deepened, or challenged your thinking.</li>\n<li>Discuss how the structure of the course—from eighteenth-century experimentation to Victorian realism—has influenced your understanding of how novels work as a form. You may refer to specific texts, concepts, or skills developed across the semester.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Purpose of the Task: </strong>This task is designed to support your development as an independent reader of literature by encouraging:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reflection on learning processes</li>\n<li>recognition of key skills and concepts</li>\n<li>consideration of how tutorials support critical thinking</li>\n<li>synthesis of insights gained through the course</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Passages will be provided on blackboard.</p>\n<p>Close reading is the term used in literary criticism for the practice of careful textual analysis that aims to understand how meaning is created through literary technique. When we “close read” a passage of text, we ask ourselves how the stylistic features of literary writing (such as genre, imagery, rhyme, meter, descriptive or figurative language, point of view, narrative voice, dialogue, plot structure, setting, characterisation, tone, irony, stage direction, etc.) work to convey meaning. Consider these features while discussing what is important or significant about the passage.</p>\n<p>As a close reading of your chosen passage, your discussion will focus on literary technique and meaning. This means that your primary focus is the passage itself. You may wish also to consider and discuss the passage’s broader thematic and contextual allusions, but keep in mind that there is no wider reading or research required for this exercise beyond consulting your own seminar and lecture notes and very carefully reading the passage.</p>\n<p>Credit will be given for effective structuring of your commentary and clear, concise communication of ideas; close attention to the writer’s uses of language and literary form; accurate and thoughtful understanding of the passage’s content and context; careful selection and analysis of quotations.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
