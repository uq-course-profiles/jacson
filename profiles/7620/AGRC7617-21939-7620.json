This will be marked by your primary supervisor.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this 4-part mid-project assessment is to a) articulate your research problem early on b) encourage conceptual organisation c) promote professional reflection on complex issues around supervision, communication and project management d) foster the use of ubiquitous project management tools such as mind maps and GANTT charts and e) enable responsible use of generative AI.</p>\n<p>N.B. You will not be penalised if your research strategy changes after this assessment piece is submitted. Indeed, adaptation, pivots and change are acknowledged as a normal and healthy part of research science. This is intended to be a constructive process – not a punitive one.</p>\n<p>The assessment will a) introduce you to tools and processes that help scientists meet deadlines without undue stress and time pressure but also b) support productive change, should the evidence indicate to you and your team that change is required.</p>\n<p>You are given 4 tasks to complete:</p>\n<p>·      Proposal / strategy document (1 page)</p>\n<p>·      Mind map (1 page)</p>\n<p>·      GANTT chart (1 page)</p>\n<p>·      Professional reflection and questionnaire (there are 13 questions to guide your reflection).</p>\n<p>You are encouraged to develop the first three of these in consultation with your project supervisor WITHOUT recourse to AI.</p>\n<p>Once you have mature drafts of all three in place you are then encouraged to use a generative AI system of your choice for provision of feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<p>As part of your professional reflection, you will then be asked to make specific comments on the utility of generative AI in the context of these 3 activities.</p>\n<p>You are encouraged to develop your personal reflection in consultation with your supervisor. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use generative AI to help you write your personal reflection.</p>\n<p>The assessment document available on BB includes some links to supporting Freeware.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing the components of the assessment task indicated above. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>The use of AI and / or MT must be acknowledged using a statement recorded on the coversheet.
