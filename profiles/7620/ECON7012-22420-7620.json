With this knowledge, students are given the tools to assist them in making informed, strategic, business decisions.</p>\n<p>Using the perspectives outlined above, the assessment task requires students to write an essay by reflecting on a variety of economic concepts and critically analysing the impacts on their chosen business<strong>. </strong>Students must write no more than 2,700 words to address each section of the Major Assignment Marking Criteria, with full details of the marking criteria and how to successfully complete the assessment task available on the course Blackboard site under Assessment &gt; Assessment 3: Major Assignment (Individual Essay). </p>\n<p><strong>AI STATEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
