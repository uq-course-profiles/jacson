Students will complete a worksheet and reflect on their practices as they work through these activities with their peers. Course staff will bring physical copies of the worksheet for students to complete. At the end of the respective lecture, each student will submit their completed physical worksheet to the lecturer in-person. A student can earn up to 4 marks for each completed worksheet submitted. Only the best five (5) out of seven (7) worksheets will be counted.</p>\n<p>These exercises are NOT quizzes. They are designed to guide students through a specific aspect of research (e.g., literature search), invite students to try different techniques, and ask them to reflect on their practices. The performance in the activities per se does not affect the marks from these exercises. Only the quality of documentation and/or reflection in the worksheet will affect the marks.</p>\n<p>Since it may be difficult to add additional students after an activity has started, students wishing to earn marks from an in-class exercise should attend the respective lecture on time. Course staff reserves the right to refuse a worksheet submission if a student arrives to class after the core component of the activity is over.</p>\n<p>As the activities are to be run during lectures, students are expected to be available. Students with a disability, mental health or medical condition, illness, injury or exceptional circumstances preventing them from regular class attendance should contact the course coordinator at the beginning of the semester to organise alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Use</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
