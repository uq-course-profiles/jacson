The length of the final thesis should be between 10,000 and 15,000 words. This variance is to ensure adequate information is presented across the introduction, literature critique, design, results, discussion and recommendations and conclusions; your supervisors will guide you to your word length based on the approach you take with your thesis.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The final format of the honours thesis may take the form of a traditional thesis (as detailed on the following pages), or as a thesis including publication/s (likely manuscripts under review given the timeline of the honours program). Where publication/s are included in your thesis you will need to provide a response addressing each of the thesis sections that would be addressed in a traditional thesis and how you have addressed these in your manuscript. Further, when submitting a thesis by publication, you will also be required to submit evidence of submission to your chosen journal and the journal aims, scope and guidelines. The journal must be mutually agreed upon between you and your supervisory team.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The thesis format for Nursing and Midwifery Honours follows the UQ Thesis requirements, which includes the UQ preamble (Word template is available in the course Blackboard Assessment Tab). Page two and three of this document provides the structure recommended for the honours thesis.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Further information about thesis formats can be found the course Blackboard Assessment Tab.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>As the sole author of the thesis you are the copyright holder and therefore you are fully responsible for everything contained in it. If the thesis contains third-party material (for example photographs, maps, drawings), you must obtain permission to reproduce copyright material if permission has not already been granted as part of the publication process by the copyright holder. If copyright on a publication or third-party material has been assigned to a publisher, permission must be sought to reproduce the work in the thesis. </p>\n<p>Submission: All courses require students to submit an electronic version of their assignment via Blackboard. Please check the companion website assessment area for specific instructions on this process. A link will be made available in the assessment area of your Blackboard course to allow you to submit your assignment electronically. The anti plagiarism software TURNITIN is being used at UQ.
