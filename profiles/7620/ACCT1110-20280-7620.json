Each Tutorial Preparation Task is worth 2.5 marks for a possible total of 20 marks.</p>\n<p><strong>What do I need to do in preparation for the tutorials?</strong></p>\n<p>In preparation for the tutorials throughout the semester, you will answer a question(s) provided to you on Blackboard. You will upload your answer to Blackboard by Monday 8am of that tutorial week and then attend the on-campus tutorial you have enrolled in. Due to time constraints, you will not be provided with detailed feedback about your individual online submission.</p>\n<p>Tutorials Preparation Tasks are due and <strong>must be submitted ONLINE into the relevant tutorial submission folder on Blackboard by 8am on the Monday that tutorials for that week start.</strong> <em> For example, the lecture from Week 1 will be covered in the Week 2 tutorial, and the Tutorial Preparation Task for that week will be due on Monday at 8am in Week 2.</em> This means that the first Tutorial Preparation Task is due <strong>by 8am on Monday 2 March</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A student will be awarded <strong>2.5 marks</strong> per tutorial by doing the following:</li>\n<li><strong>submitting the Tutorial Preparation Task online by the due date</strong> and</li>\n<li>attending the tutorial <strong>for its entire duration.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The assessment is <strong>pass/fail</strong>. A pass will mean that 2.5 marks will be allocated per tutorial. You should attempt 8 (eight) of the 11 (eleven) Tutorial Preparation Task and attend the relevant tutorials (<strong>maximum of 20 marks).</strong> The criterion for passing is whether, in the opinion of your tutor, you have made a <strong>reasonable and serious attempt to answer the Tutorial Preparation Tasks as well as attended the relevant tutorial for its entire duration</strong>.</li>\n<li>While collaboration, i.e. oral discussion of the questions, is acceptable, it is expected that any notes submitted for marking will reflect independent thought and judgement. Copying notes from other students<strong> is not acceptable</strong> and may be treated as academic misconduct.</li>\n<li>Note that the feedback for this piece of assessment will be the tutorial itself, i.e. the one to which the preparation relates. The answers will not be returned with comments, and so students should take the opportunity to raise any questions during the tutorial.</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, a mark out of 20 will be given to each student if, in the overall judgement of the course coordinator, the criteria set out in the course profile have been satisfied.</li>\n<li><strong>Answers cannot be submitted after class, or by email, or by another student on your behalf</strong>. Students must attend the tutorial with their answers and stay for the duration of the tutorial to receive any marks. A student will not obtain a mark for tutorial preparation if they do not attend the tutorial group in which they are enrolled.</li>\n<li>The maximum mark can be achieved by submitting and attending 8 times in the course of the semester. Students can be absent or not prepare three times and still gain the full marks for tutorial preparation. This is designed to accommodate emergencies and other reasons for non-preparation. If a student is unable to attend their enrolled tutorial (after three absences), for example due to illness or a medical condition, then that student may apply for an extension in accordance with the usual assessment extension process. (Should you miss more than three tutorials and wish to apply for an extension, visit: <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension\">https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension</a>). Students should submit an application for an extension for tutorial preparation only after they have failed to prepare for a third time. If an extension is granted, then that student may submit the notes to the tutor for the tutorial in which they are enrolled, together with a copy of the extension approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Students should not email the Course Coordinator regarding special requests for non-preparation except in the exceptional case where the student is unable to attend tutorials over the entire semester.</strong></li>\n<li>After enrolments close, students will not be permitted to change their enrolment in a tutorial <strong>without the written permission of the Course Coordinator.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
