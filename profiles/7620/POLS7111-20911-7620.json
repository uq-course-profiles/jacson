This can be done either in-person before and/or after the seminar or in writing via the Course Convener's UQ staff e-mail (a.jedzini@uq.edu.au). Additionally, it is a requirement students seek approval for working on an agreed topic by submitting their Proposal for the Policy Case Study Report via Turnitin. Passing the Proposal for the Policy Case Study Report is a pre-condition for submitting the Policy Case Study Report.</p>\n<p>The Proposal for the Policy Case Study Report will cover the scope including the wording of the topic, the relevant policy theories, the relevant empirical sources for the research, and the student's research approach.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Policy Case Study Report</em></strong></p>\n<p>Students' Policy Case Study Report will analyse a selected policy problem, decision or trend, by relating it to wider theories and issues about the policymaking process as discussed extensively in the course.</p>\n<p>The Policy Case Study Report should aim to connect policy theory to the policy example students have chosen. In selecting a policy issue or policy problem or policy process, students need to ensure that their topic is not only of interest to themselves, but is also likely to have a sufficient range of material available for students to provide an in-depth analysis of the actors, processes and context in which the policy decision or policy outcome was produced.</p>\n<p>The analytical task is to explain what happened and why in relation to students' policy example.</p>\n<p>Where practicable, students might consider using both primary sources (e.g. government documents) and secondary sources (e.g. commentaries by scholars, stakeholders and media analysts). The conceptual task is to connect students' analysis of their problem or policy case to the broader themes and theories discussed in the course.</p>\n<p>Simply describing what happened is not enough. Please note, the use of any Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) is forbidden and will constitute student misconduct.</p>\n<p>The Policy Case Study Report should be clearly structured and properly referenced (approximately 10 references per 1,000 words) using the POLSIS Essay Guide. The word limit is 3000 words (excluding in-text references, reference list and appendix) with a +-10% tolerance.</p>\n<p>If relevant, it is acceptable to attach a short documentary or statistical appendix to back up an argument.
