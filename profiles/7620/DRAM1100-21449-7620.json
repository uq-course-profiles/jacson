You are graded on participation in tutorials; attendance itself isn't enough because it is assumed that you will be present. Participation means willing involvement, active engagement with the text, the tasks at hand and each other, asking questions, working well in groups, etc. Acting ability is not assessed. Central to group work is accountability and the relationships that you develop with your peers. Peer accountability will be considered when determining the group work aspect of your participation grade. Meaningful participation is worth 2/3 of your grade.</p>\n<p>The two components of meaningful engagement assessed are reading of the text/s and absorption of lecture content. You are assessed on how you demonstrate your absorption of the lecture content, which means that, to prepare, you must attend the lecture and complete the preparatory readings. You should bring a copy of the relevant text and any additional material, such as handouts, to every tutorial, and you must have read them at least once. It is a requirement that students read the set text before they attend tutorials. You will be asked to write 50 words in response to a prompt in class to demonstrate this knowledge. Meaningful engagement is worth 1/3 of your grade.</p>\n<p>If you are absent from your tutorial through documented illness or other documented circumstances beyond your control, and supply this documentation to your tutor, you will receive a pass mark (in the range of a four) for that week. Students will receive a mark out of 3 for each week, and will be given written feedback on their participation in <strong>Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 </strong>about the preceding two weeks of participation.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Your performances will be graded on, amongst other things, your engagement with technology and performance techniques as introduced in the tutorials. Your acting skill will not be directly assessed. </p>\n<p>Group members will each receive the same grade out of 35 for the performance. The remaining five marks will be determined through a peer-accountability survey, where you will be required to provide feedback on the work of your peers against criteria in BuddyCheck. If you do not participate in the BuddyCheck survey, you will not receive the peer-accountability marks.</p>\n<p>There is a 10-minute maximum performance time for this assignment. This short piece will be performed for other DRAM1100 students in Week 12, and you may be asked to perform outside your normal tutorial time. Each group is required to submit a 100-word rationale outlining the aims of their performance, and you will be provided with some technical support in the performance of your projects, with access to sound, lighting and video performance technology. You will also have access to rehearsal time in tutorials after the mid-semester break.</p>\n<p>A full assignment brief will be made available on Blackboard during the semester.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>All presentations</em> will be recorded for marking purposes via recording facilities available where the assessment takes place (eg.
