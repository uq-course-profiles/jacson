            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>The presentation is a group work, each group consisting of 4 self-selected students, facilitated through the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>Group Investigation: Each group will explore one “Special Topic in Food” from the list provided by the course coordinator. During the allocated teaching weeks (as advised on Blackboard), groups will collaborate to discuss the topic, gather information from credible sources (e.g., lecture material, readings, library databases, books, research papers, reputable government/industry sites), and prepare a <strong>12-minute PowerPoint presentation that must be recorded via Echo</strong>. <strong>The steps to create a Echo Vidoe are in this link</strong> <a href=\"https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-ultra/echovideo-ultra-student\">https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-ultra/echovideo-ultra-student</a>. Tutorial time slots have been allocated for group work to allow the group to come together and assemble the presentation; however, group work will likely be required outside these set times in order to complete the task. Group members are encouraged to communicate outside regular hours to coordinate and complete the assessment. Additionally, the instructor will be available during tutorial sessions to address any queries.</p>\n<p>Recorded presentation requirements: The group must <strong>present their slides in Echo and record the presentation</strong> (slides and audio must be clearly captured). Each group must identify four key aspects of the topic and each student will take responsibility for one aspect (research + slides + presenting). The presentation should introduce the topic clearly without becoming overly technical, and then move into slightly more specific content later (e.g., referring to research and presenting at least one graph/figure/table, explained in your own words). The recorded presentation must include a short conclusion with 2–3 take-home messages and a slide at the end with the reference list. Any figures/tables used must include a source on the slide where they appear.</p>\n<p>Submission: The <strong>Echo recording file</strong> must be submitted before the due date/time through an Assignment submission link in Blackboard. Only one group member needs to submit the file, but the submission must include the topic title and the names of all group members.</p>\n<p>Peer Assessment: Each student is responsible for evaluating the individual contributions of the other three group members using the Peer Assessment form provided on Blackboard. Peer assessment contributes to an individual mark out of 10. Failure to submit the peer assessment form by the due date/time will result in 0/10 for the peer assessment component (individual mark).</p>\n<p>Marks: Presentation = 30 marks (group mark); Peer assessment = 10 marks (individual mark).</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) tools, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI or MT will provide only limited support and guidance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be acknowledged appropriately. Please see assessment guidelines in blackboard course site for specific instructions. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
