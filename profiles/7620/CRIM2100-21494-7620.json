Seminars will include small-group, pair, and class discussion, role-play and problem-solving activities. </p>\n<p>In four designated weeks (weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12), students will be assessed for their completion of a discussion worksheet. The worksheets pose questions that ask you to reflect on the discussion in the room as well as your understanding of the readings and lectures. The word length for each paper is up to 500 words each (2000 words overall, across 4 papers).</p>\n<p><strong>Seminar-related questions to be addressed on the worksheet will be released during the seminars.</strong> <strong>This means you must attend the seminar to receive the worksheet questions. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note that you are responsible for the material covered in all seminars. Seminar questions posed in each designated week can refer to the current and/or earlier seminars.</strong>  </p>\n<p>You are also highly encouraged to draw on course readings, lectures, your own critical reasoning, and - when prompted - to also source external resources, when completing the worksheets. Details are provided in the marking rubric. <strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p>Each discussion worksheet is worth 12.5% of your overall grade (50% for all four worksheets, overall).</p>\n<p><strong>The Use of AI:</strong> <em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
