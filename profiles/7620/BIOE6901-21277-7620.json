Teams will capture and refine stakeholder needs, translate needs into measurable requirements, apply design control and risk management principles, and demonstrate consideration of relevant standards/regulatory pathways, safety, and ethics.</p>\n<p>The project begins from a predefined clinical need provided by a stakeholder (e.g., clinician, patient, industry).
