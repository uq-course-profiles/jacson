The 10 assessable tutorials require students to submit a hand-written IL&amp;AC answer to IL&amp;AC questions which are released in tutorials during semester (see Learning Activities). Each of the ten (10) Assessable Tutorial Submission (ATS) questions are IL&amp;AC problem questions using the IL&amp;AC technique and are each worth a maximum of two (2) marks, each then totalling 20% of the overall course mark).</p>\n<p>To receive full marks for a tutorial, students answers must make a serious and reasonable attempt at answering the ATS IL&amp;AC question(s). A 'serious and reasonable attempt' is not necessarily a correct answer. However, the answer must demonstrate a genuine effort to engage with the question(s) using materials from lectures, the assigned texts, cases and statutes and other sources referenced either in lectures, the course Blackboard site or assigned texts.</p>\n<p>Please take note of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The question for each ATS will be released in the relevant tutorial. Students will be given time to read the ATS question, hand-write their own IL&amp;AC answer to the question and answers will be briefly discussed at the end of each tutorial. Tutorials are not recorded and whilst brief guidelines about the answer to each question will be released, these guidelines will not be a full and formative answer to a submission - students must attend the scheduled tutorials during the semester to obtain the full benefit of the assessment and the discussion since this will aid them in their understanding of both the subject material and IL&amp;AC answer technique;</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, a total mark out of 20 will be given to each student if, in the overall judgement of the course coordinator, the grading criteria set out in the CP have been satisfied.</li>\n<li>Student answers to these submissions must be hand-written and submitted during each relevant tutorial.</li>\n<li>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
