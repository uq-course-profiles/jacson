Marks will be allocated for the identification and treatment of the issues relevant to the solution of each submission.This assessment requires students to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of relevant law through their written communication and analyse and apply critical thinking skills to produce an IL&amp;AC answer. Students must carefully analyse and solve IL&amp;AC problem questions, clearly justifying their answers, a skill that can be transferred to many areas in future careers. Students must make a serious and reasonable attempt to answer each IL&amp;AC question. Further grading information will be made available on the course Blackboard website and further details about the questions will be provided in workshops and on Blackboard during the semester.</p>\n<p>Please take note of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The question for each AWS will be released in the relevant workshop. Students will be given time to read the question, hand-write their own IL&amp;AC answer to the question and answers will be discussed at the end of each workshop. Workshops are not recorded and whilst brief guidelines about the answer to each question will be released, these guidelines will not be a full and formative answer to a submission - students must attend the scheduled workshops during the semester to obtain the full benefit of the assessment and the discussion since this will aid them in their understanding of both the subject material and IL&amp;AC answer technique;</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, a mark out of 25 will be given to each student if, in the overall judgement of the course coordinator, the grading criteria set out in the CP have been satisfied.</li>\n<li>Student answers to these submissions must be hand-written and submitted during each relevant workshop.</li>\n<li>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
