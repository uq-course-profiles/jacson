You will need to undertake two (2) different types of tasks in preparation for writing your analysis: an experiential learning task and a research task. Each task is described below followed by a detailed outline of the requirements for writing your assignment.</p>\n<p><em>(a) Experiential Learning Task</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are required to participate in the Everest Simulation game and record your experiences in the Everest Simulation Log. (Note: The Log will be provided when you participate in the simulation at your tutorial session).</li>\n<li>Read over your Everest Simulation Log and identify the problems or issues that arose in your simulation experience which involve Ethics and Planning or Controlling. <em>(Note: This is a brainstorming stage. The aim is to identify as many problems or issues as possible that might be relevant to your personal experience before narrowing them down.)</em></li>\n<li>Compare the different problems/issues that you have identified. Choose ONE (1) problem/issue which involves Ethics and ONE (1) problem/issue which involves Planning or Controlling. Given that these two problems/issues will be the focus of your assignment, you should try to choose problems/issues that you find most relevant, interesting or meaningful to your simulation experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>(b) Research Task</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search within scholarly management journals for articles that relate to the two problems/issues you have chosen as the focus of your assignment.</li>\n<li>Find TWO (2) articles for EACH of your problems/issues. That is, you need to find two research articles on the topic of Ethics and two articles on the topic of Planning or Controlling (four articles in total). Your articles must be published in one of the journals on the ABCD List. This list represents high quality, peer reviewed scholarly journals, and we use these journals because they publish the best available scientific evidence.</li>\n<li>The following approach might help you to think about which articles are good choices for your assignment. What question is the author(s) trying to answer in their research and how does it relate to the problem/issue I’m interested in? What did the author(s) find? How do their findings provide evidence that is interesting and relevant to my simulation experience? What evidence does the article offer for solving the problem/issue I identified?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
