In our case this will be a conciliation conference about a dismissal from employment. We will focus on the first part of a standard conciliation conference - presenting opening statements and discussion. This assessment will be supported by a lecture in week 7 on dispute resolution, focusing on mediation/conciliation, and a tutorial exploring the skills necessary to undertake the task. It will test knowledge developed in weeks 5 - 8.</p>\n<p><strong>In pairs or groups of three, students will prepare a seven-minute oral opening statement</strong> representing either the employee or the employer. Students will have at least four weeks to prepare their opening statements. Students may select their own partner or group, or choose to be allocated by the course coordinator to a group of three. All group members must be involved in the preparation and agree on the final statement to be delivered.</p>\n<p>Students will then present their opening statement in an in-person simulated conference environment. Students may choose one or more group members to deliver the opening statement. After opening statements are presented, there will be discussion (questions, answers, further comments). All students must be prepared to participate in discussion. Each conference will last 30 minutes. Conferences will be recorded for moderation purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Conferences will be scheduled during weeks 10 and 11</strong>. To ensure equitable access, some times will be outside business hours. <strong>All group members will receive the same mark for the group work component</strong>.
