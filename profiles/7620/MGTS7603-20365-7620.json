Please see detailed marking rubrics on the course blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an individual assignment</strong>. The assignment (i.e. report) is 2000 (+/-10%) words in length and it is <strong>worth 40% of the total course weighting.</strong>   </p>\n<p><strong>Aim: </strong>The primary aim of the assignment is to enable students to see the intricate connection between theory and practice SHRM processes through a case method. The assignment also aims to help students develop analytical and practical skills in the design, implementation and evaluation of SHRM. Cases are known to provide a context to experience real-world challenges that are enveloped in complicated processes and uncertainties. The cases are therefore a strong teaching tool and a platform where students engage in experiential learning process by getting them to teach themselves and each other. Altogether, cases help the students to learn the value of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>responding actively and constructively to the SHRM issues in organisations,</li>\n<li>gaining multiple perspectives on situations by using theory, concepts and research findings,</li>\n<li>recognizing that a situation may involve many problems and that different stakeholders will most likely experience divergent views and problems</li>\n<li>develop an action orientation and a willingness to take some calculated risks when information is not complete,</li>\n<li>appreciate the complexity of translating proposed solutions into comprehensive and detailed plans for action and</li>\n<li>seeking to understand the consequences and limits of managerial actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background and Rationale to the Assignment</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment continues the process of strategic HRM interventions and decision making and the use and application of the SHRM models/frameworks to real-world cases in organisations. </p>\n<p>The main difference between assessment task 1 and assessment task 2 is that, whereas students were asked to evaluate SHRM models or frameworks in assessment 1 and apply these frameworks to selected cases provided by the lecturer, students will have the opportunity to identify and select a contemporary organisation in Australia or overseas for assessment 2 to apply their SHRM models or frameworks to issues affecting their chosen organisation. Students are expected to critically analyse the SHRM issues facing their chosen organisation and write a business report with solutions and recommendations that constructively address the issues in their chosen organisation. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students may choose different SHRM models or frameworks or any other appropriate frameworks from the general business literature that are relevant and necessary to address the issues in the student's chosen organisation. Working as an HRM advisor, you are to present your solutions and recommendations in a business report. The report will be submitted on blackboard via Turnitin.</p>\n<p> <strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of assessment task 2 is to enable students to build on their knowledge and skills of SHRM theories and processes through a case study method. Students will also understand the connections between theory and practice and develop practical skills in analysing, designing, implementing and evaluating SHRM processes and practices in organisations.</p>\n<p><strong>The Key Tasks:</strong></p>\n<p>You will produce a 2000-word business report with at least 10 academic peer-reviewed sources. Your report will address the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide on a medium to large organisations where there is a SHRM challenge/issue (e.g. recruitment, learning and development, performance management, talent management, etc). Also, it is NOT necessary to contact the organisation for interviews or visits. Students should rely only on secondary research including but not limited to company websites, strategic plans, annual reports, industry and analysts' reports. In deciding what organisation to examine as a case study, you may want to first of all consult the media (e.g. business review, daily newspaper articles), the Australian Stock Exchange List or general Google search for medium to large organisations in Australia or overseas to get a quick impression of what businesses or organisations may be currently experiencing SHRM challenges in Australia or overseas.</li>\n<li>Based on the contents of MGTS7603 learning activities, you will determine the major SHRM challenges/issues (e.g. recruitment, learning and development, performance management, talent management, etc) the organisation is facing and why it is important to study and resolve this issue in the organisation.</li>\n<li>Provide an analysis of the internal and external environments of the organisations and background of the SHRM issues (e.g. historical, contextual or technological) in the organisation using appropriate analytical tools such as SWOT, PESTLE, Porter's Five-forces, etc.</li>\n<li>Conduct a review of the literature on the SHRM issue and identify major schools of thought about the SHRM issues, theories/models that best explain the SHRM issues and appropriate interventions to address the issues. Preferably, it is important to begin with the theories and models discussed in the course. However, you are NOT limited to the theories and models discussed in the course. </li>\n<li>Critically examine the SHRM issues in your case organisation using theories and models from the course as well as your literature review materials.</li>\n<li>Suggest at least two alternative ways (options) to manage the SHRM challenge/issues in your chosen organisation.</li>\n<li>Provide evidence of clear and concise articulation of the connection between SHRM theories/models and practice.</li>\n<li>Develop and present a clear set of recommendations to the executive director, CEO or Human Resource Manager of your case organisation on how to implement your proposed recommendations.</li>\n<li>Identify two key lessons you learned in writing and reporting on SHRM issues using a case study method.</li>\n<li>Evaluation: Report rubrics will be enforced. Please see the course blackboard for the rubrics.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process: </strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Report Outline</strong>: Draw a report outline and discuss with your facilitator/course lecturer</p>\n<p><strong>Report Proper</strong>: Write out your report. Students are encouraged to consult the UQBS Assignment Writing Guide in writing their reports. The UQBS Assignment Writing Guide will be on the course Blackboard. Additional guidance will be provided in the lectures and tutorials throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>This is <strong>a formal report and should adhere to the standards</strong> (including reference styles) of a formal academic report writing.
