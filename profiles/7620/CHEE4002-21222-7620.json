Explain the key stages of the standard ISO31000 process for risk management. Describe each of the operational risks, and explain how critical they are for process companies. Describe what it means to be a professional engineer, and why your professional practice is important for how you will manage risk. Explain why human performance dominates risk in hazardous industries, and explain the different roles that humans may adopt in regard to risk. Explain why it is important for system designers to consider how they can better consider human performance to achieve more successful outcomes."
