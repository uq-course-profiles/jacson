These quizzes draw on the assigned readings and activities, reinforcing your understanding of key concepts. Frequent low-stakes testing is one of the most effective learning strategies we know—it promotes better long-term retention than passive review alone (Roediger et al., 2011).</p>\n<p>To help you prepare, we'll release a 30-question practice quiz on Blackboard one week before each in-class quiz. These practice quizzes let you engage actively with the material, get comfortable with the question format, and—most importantly—identify what you understand well and where you might need to focus more attention before the real thing.</p>\n<p>There are 12 quizzes in total (starting in Class 2), each worth 5%. Only your top 10 scores count toward your final grade, making up 50% overall. Quiz results will typically appear on Blackboard within a week or two; if you have questions about your marks, feel free to contact the tutors.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>No AI Allowed</strong></p>\n<p>These quizzes assess your own understanding of the material.

These aren't abstract exercises; they're practical challenges that ask you to apply what you're learning to help solve genuine puzzles about human thinking and behaviour.</p>\n<p>You might be asked to design a feature for a streaming platform grappling with users' false memories, create a diagnostic tool for a workplace that keeps blaming personality instead of situations, or develop a guide that helps parents let go of learning myths. Each task requires you to create something tangible (typically a PDF) using generative AI tools.</p>\n<p>Your submission has two components: the AI-generated output itself (1%) and a brief reflection (1%) describing what you tried, what you learned, and whether the AI proved helpful or misleading. You must submit the AI output to earn marks for the reflection.</p>\n<p>There are 11 tasks across the semester; your best 10 count toward a total of 20%.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI use</strong></p>\n<p>You may use any appropriate generative AI tool to complete these exercises. Each week's brief will specify exactly what's required, and you're encouraged to use AI creatively—not just for generating content, but for brainstorming, testing ideas, role-playing as sceptical users, or challenging your own assumptions.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Why this assessment?</strong></p>\n<p>These exercises pair hands-on AI practice with thoughtful reflection, helping you develop critical thinking about what AI can and can't do well. More importantly, they give you experience applying cognitive science to real problems—the kind of challenges you'll encounter in workplaces, communities, and everyday life.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
