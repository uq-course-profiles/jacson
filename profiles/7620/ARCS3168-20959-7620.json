Students will select from four grades of taxa related to early human evolution that will be covered in the first five weeks of the course. For each taxa, students must draw and label the skeletal remains that are present from a list provided on Blackboard Ultra (e.g., cranium and mandible, femur, humerus). Each fossil specimen needs to be drawn (either physically and then scanned, or digitally with software such as Adobe Illustrator) in at least two different views - anterior and lateral (but more is acceptable) with a scale for reference. Each feature label will include information about the importance of the feature in terms of human evolution and changes in the fossil record. A short description (~250 words) of the grade must also be included, with additional information about the descriptions provided on Blackboard Ultra.</p>\n<p>You will have time available in the second hour of each session to examine the physical casts in the teaching laboratory. You can use illustrations from the readings as well as 3D models available online through websites such as SketchFab.com. The illustrations must be either free-hand drawings or outlines of the fossil specimen -- labelling photographs or published illustrations is NOT sufficient. The portfolio will be submitted as either a Word document or PDF online through Turn-it-in by the due date and time. </p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard Ultra for this course. </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. Students must complete an AI usage declaration and submit it with their assessment. Additional resources are available through <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/study-and-learning-support/ai-student-hub\">UQ AI Student Hub</a>. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It should be developed as a response to a specific research question in human evolution. Four essay topics relating to a key concept in human evolution will be provided. If you would like to develop your own topic, discuss and confirm your specific research question with the course co-ordinator.</p>\n<p>The research question should be stated clearly as part of the title of your essay. The essay should be based on original reading and research in the relevant palaeoanthropological, archaeological and palaeoenvironmental literature, with at least 8 references in your bibliography. As this is an essay assessment, your examination of the topic should have all the elements of an essay including an introduction, conclusion, and thesis statement.</p>\n<p>Referencing style: Students must use Chicago style for references (footnotes) and bibliographies: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html</p>\n<p>Word Limits: A word count that is within ±10% of the set length (1,500 words) is acceptable.
