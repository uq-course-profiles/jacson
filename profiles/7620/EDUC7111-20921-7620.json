Your task is to plan, conduct and write up a research project that captures an expression of ‘globalisation’. There are two topics to choose from. Option 1 investigates education market-making. Option 2 explores a globalising technology, generative AI and its effect on teachers' labour.</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> <em> </em><strong>Education Market-making: A situated perspective </strong></p>\n<p>Education markets are now ubiquitous, and feature in both schooling and higher education. Education markets are constituted through decision-making about which institutions to choose for study and which places are considered hospitable and safe. Markets are also enabled by complex circuits of financing, from the contributions of individuals and/or families and governments. Markets are increasingly enabled by the uses of sociotechnical devices to persuade and legitimise the desires and perceptions of stakeholders. Education markets are also known to have broader multi-scalar effects on urban and national settings, and on the livelihoods and identities of people and places.</p>\n<p>As part of Assignment 1, describe how you intend to investigate market-making. Include a description of your context - schooling or higher education - and national setting. Decide on which actor (s) you will focus on, e.g. students and their parents/families, educators or education agents, or another market actor. How will you use the theoretical constructs introduced in EDUC 7111 to inform your project? What kinds of questions might you ask of your respondents?</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2: Generative AI &amp; Teachers' Labour : A situated perspective</strong></p>\n<p>Generative AI is currently taking the world by storm.  Drawing on peer reviewed and empirically driven literature, your task is to examine how generative AI is affecting the labour of teachers and the craft of teaching in your context.  You will use literature to formulate a series of questions will form the basis of Assignment 2 where you will analyse changes to the working conditions and subjectivity or personhood of teachers as they engage with generative AI in the everyday.</p>\n<p><strong>What to submit for Assignment 1</strong></p>\n<p>You are required to submit three (3) items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A five (5) minute video where you describe <strong>your topic </strong>and <strong>rationale</strong>, <strong>how you will design and conduct </strong>your research project and the <strong><em>theoretical constructs</em> or concepts </strong>that will inform your study. You must use core concepts and readings introduced in EDUC 7111.  Concepts not covered in the course will have to be linked to core course concepts.</li>\n<li>Up to three (3) PowerPoint slides with the above details outlined.</li>\n<li>A bibliography of five to eight key references that have informed your preliminary research.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
