A strong analysis will use appropriate concepts from the course to put forward <strong>an argument</strong> about the game.</p>\n<p>Students must upload the video, and a complete text transcript of the voiceover, via Blackboard.</p>\n<p>A full description, including a comprehensive grading rubric, is available in Blackboard at learn.uq.edu.au.
