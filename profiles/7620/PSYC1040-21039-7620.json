You will not have access to your original submission during the exam, so success depends on understanding and being able to justify your reasoning rather than recalling specific wording. Part A will consist of short-answers. Part B assesses your understanding of the broader course content through new scenarios and questions covering research design, statistics, ethics, and interpretation. Across both parts, the exam emphasises careful reasoning and appropriate scientific judgment rather than calculation or memorisation. Part B will consist of Multiple-Choice questions. This structure reflects the course’s emphasis on epistemic responsibility--the ability to justify and defend research-based claims under constraint.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Students engage with key principles from the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and consider how ethical constraints shape study design and interpretation. In the workshop, students evaluate research scenarios and practise making defensible ethical judgments. Before coming to the workshop, read the NHMRC National Statement (2025).
