Under the supervision, the students will determine basic soil properties: colour, texture, pH, EC and aggregate stability (LO: 1,2 ).</p>\n<p><strong>Practical 2: Characterising soil profiles</strong></p>\n<p>The practical 2 is held in field conditions (Gatton) where students will be exposed to intact soil profile in its natural surroundings. Students will be introduced to the field methods of soil profile description and classification. This includes assessment of basic soil properties, particular soil constraints and potential land use (LO: 2, 3, 4).</p>\n<p>During this field experience, students undertake hands-on soil profile description following nationally recognised protocol<strong>s</strong>, including those outlined in the <em>Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook</em> and the <em>Australian Soil Classification</em>. Students are trained to <em>observe, measure, interpret, and document soil physical and chemical properties in situ</em>, mirroring professional practice in soil survey, land capability assessment, agricultural consulting, and environmental assessment.</p>\n<p>Specifically, students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and delineate soil horizons in intact profiles;</li>\n<li>Apply field techniques to determine soil texture, structure, aggregate stability, colour (Munsell system), soil strength (penetrometer), pH, and carbonate presence;</li>\n<li>Assess soil constraints (e.g. compaction, acidity, texture contrast, drainage limitations);</li>\n<li>Classify soils using the Australian Soil Classification system and interpret diagnostic features;</li>\n<li>Link observed soil properties to land use suitability, management constraints, and environmental risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students record their observations using a professional soil profile description card adapted from industry practice, and subsequently prepare an assessed technical report that requires interpretation of field data, justification of soil classification, identification of key constraints, and recommendations for appropriate land use and management options.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical 3: Soil physical properties</strong></p>\n<p>The practical 3 is held in laboratory settings where students will be introduced to basic soil physical properties and appropriate methods to evaluate them on a set of prepared soil samples. Under the supervision, the students will determine basic soil physical properties, i.e., bulk density, soil water contents, and porosity (LO: 2, 3, 4).</p>\n<p><strong>Practical 4: Soil respiration</strong></p>\n<p>The practical 4 is held in laboratory settings where students will be introduced to basic soil biological properties and appropriate methods to evaluate them on a set of prepared soil samples. Under the supervision, the students will determine soil respiration and environmental conditions that may affect it i.e., water content, temperature and additional nutrient source.</p>\n<p>Details about Practicals will be provided within Practical Manuals, which will be made available on Blackboard site before the scheduled practical, with additional specifics about report preparation and report submission (LO: 1, 2, 4).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Important information</em></strong></p>\n<p>Practical classes are designed to provide further learning on the material covered in lectures, provide students with practical experience (laboratory and field), receive training on key soil assessment techniques/procedures, and give insight on the appropriated scientific methods. Students will be guided through the basis, design, and analysis of experiments. By engaging and participating in the practical sessions, students will be able to answer questions and prepare major portion of the practical report.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) tools, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI or MT will provide only limited support and guidance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be referenced appropriately.
