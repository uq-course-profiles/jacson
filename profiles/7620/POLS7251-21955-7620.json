The class will be provided with a list of approximately 70 terms that are crucial to understanding the course, organized by week, prior to the start of semester.</p>\n<p>Each week I will select 2 terms that were covered during the previous week's seminar. During the seminar you will be given 13 minutes to write a definition of one of the two terms I have selected from this list and displayed on the screen. <em>Please note that the time the quiz is offered will vary from week to week, but that it will occur at some stage during the scheduled seminar time depending on that week's structure. </em></p>\n<p>The definition has two parts:  Part A asks you to identify the basic meaning of a term. Part B requires you to explain why this term matters to international relations. Part A is worth 1 mark, part B is worth 3 marks (4 marks total). </p>\n<p>There are 11 (eleven) opportunities to take the quiz, but you only need to do it 7 (seven) times, forming 28% of your grade. If you do more than 7 quizzes, we will select your top 7 results. This means that you can miss up to four quizzes without a penalty. <em>Please note that there are </em>NO <em>opportunities to re-take individual quizzes and no alternative assessment available except in the very specific circumstances outlined below. </em>In other words: be organized and try to take as many quizzes as early as you can! If you do more than 7 quizzes, you can seriously improve your grade as we will take your top results.</p>\n<p>Each week I will run through the definition from the previous week and provide examples of what constituted excellent work. As these terms are crucial components of international relations theory and the study of international relations, I will be able to use your knowledge to enhance class discussion and overall learning in the course. The final exam for the course has a definitions component, so by doing this activity weekly and discussing the definitions during each lecture you will also enhance your performance on the final exam. </p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a Disability Action Plan that applies to the quiz please contact me ASAP. We can make accommodations in the seminar for many of the issues documented in Disability Action Plans (e.g., if you cannot handwrite exams).</p>\n<p>The quizzes are scheduled to take 13 minutes in order to provide extra time for any student who requires that extra time in a Disability Action Plan. If your Disability Action Plan requires you to have additional extra time please get in touch as soon as possible to discuss alternatives.</p>\n<p>If a student has a genuine (documented) reason they have been unable to attend the seminar on 7 occasions, a make up test will be offered late in the semester, using the same master list of definitions. <strong>Given the extensive flexibility built into this assessment and the fact you can miss 4 quizzes with no penalty it is very unlikely that alternative assessment will be granted except in truly exceptional and documented circumstances, e.g. serious illness, sudden change of job, etc. The make-up quiz is NOT designed for students who miss one or two classes due to minor illness or do not plan ahead and miss too many quizzes early in the semester. </strong></p>\n<p>Please note that the make-up quiz only comes in one form: you do all 7 definitions from a list I provide before the start of the make-up quiz in 95 minutes. This is the only format for the make-up quiz (although extra time can be provided for those with Disability Action Plans).</p>\n<p>To be eligible for alternative assessment, you must contact me by <strong>30 MARCH with</strong> your documentation. If there is an unforeseeable change to your circumstances (eg illness, new job) after that date, please contact me as soon as you can with documentation.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.
