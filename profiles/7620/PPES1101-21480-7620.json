The preparatory exercises consist of four reading comprehension questions and two speculative questions. The weekly questions will be made available on Blackboard. Answers to the reading comprehension questions should be short (one to two sentences in length) and should refer to a specific passage in the weekly reading. Answers to the speculative questions should be more expansive (a short paragraph). These questions will form the basis of seminar discussions.</p>\n<p>To be awarded the two marks for each seminar, you must: </p>\n<p>a) Upload your responses to Turnitin by Thursday (5pm) before the Friday seminar.</p>\n<p>b) Correctly answer at least two of the short answers and produce answers of appropriate length and quality to the longer questions.</p>\n<p>c) Attend the seminar and participate meaningfully in class discussion.</p>\n<p>There are no part marks, i.e. your mark each week will be either 2 or 0 (your score will be treated as a proxy for the quality of your participation).</p>\n<p>Missed seminars due to illness will be counted if a doctor’s certificate is provided. If you are unable to attend due to technical issues or other unavoidable circumstances, please contact your course coordinator <strong>prior </strong>to the tutorial. In such cases, you may submit a 500-word summary of the set reading, along with the worksheet. Please note that there will be a limit to the number of summaries that can be submitted in lieu of participation.</p>\n<p>***This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

The scope of the essay is open, allowing you to choose the two thinkers and the terms of comparison. Students will either select from a list of suggested research topics (available on Blackboard) or propose a topic of their own (to be discussed with the course coordinator).</p>\n<p>This is a research essay, which means that you are required you to engage with the primary texts of your two thinkers and to provide evidence for your claims from their relevant writings. It is expected that no less than 10% of your essay should be direct quotes from appropriate primary sources with page numbers included (approximately 5 quotes per thinker). There is also the expectation that you will situate your argument in relation to the relevant secondary literature. No fewer than five secondary sources should be included.</p>\n<p>*** This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Following submission, students will informally discuss their paper with the course coordinator (usually for no more than 5 minutes). These discussions will be scheduled for the final seminar in Week 13.</p>\n<p>The oral response will be recorded for purposes of appeal.
