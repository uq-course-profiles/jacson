Students are asked to develop a management and/or prevention strategy for a real community problem. This can be a problem that you have experienced or witnessed in your local neighbourhood, place of work or study. In conducting your project you should follow the problem-orientated methodology:  S – Scan; A – Analyse; R- Respond; A - Assess.</p>\n<p>This first hurdle assessment is an opportunity for the student to demonstrate that they have identified an appropriate problem and method for the focus of their report. The submission of the form is required to pass the course. You will not be marked on the content, however it will give me (the lecturer) an opportunity to help students make modifications to their plans if required. The online form has two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What is community problem</strong> that you will focus on for your project and <strong>where is the problem</strong>?</li>\n<li>How do you think you will be able to document evidence about the problem? (for example, observations and photos; interviews; police statistics; newspaper/document analysis).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The pitch sessions will take place in weeks 6 (1/4) and 7 (15/4) so please plan accordingly to make sure you can attend. There will be no supplementary assessments. You must attend and present on one of the two days to pass. You will submit a video of your in-class pitch. You can get a peer to film you on your own phone. Please note that all assessment must be completed to pass this course.</p>\n<p>In addition to the in-class pitch you will be required to complete a written worksheet about your research problem and project. This will need to be submitted along with your video via turn it in. See blackboard for more details.</p>\n<p>This piece of assessment is worth 10% of your grade (5% for submission of your video; 5% for submission of a completed, quality worksheet). You must participate in both the presentation in class and submit the worksheet to pass this course. You will give your pitch to a group of your peers in class in weeks 6 (1/4) and 7 (15/4) - there are no extensions on this component. The worksheet and the video are due on the 15th of April by 2pm.
