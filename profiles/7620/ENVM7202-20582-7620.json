While you should choose a region for which there is a good amount of accessible literature, try to avoid choosing one for which there is already an available conservation project plan that follows the structure we request here, as it is important for your thought processes to be original and not simply rewording a plan that already exists. </p>\n<p>Your conservation management plan should be informed by your understanding of the Open Standards for the Practice Conservation and related content, based on the tutorial sessions, set references, and wider reading. It is also highly recommended that you visit the conservationstandards.org website, which has lots of useful resources.</p>\n<p>You should use careful literature searches to identify both journal articles and ‘grey’ literature such as reports and existing conservation plans that can inform your understanding of the region and its values, the threats they face, and conservation actions that may be appropriate and effective.</p>\n<p>Note: more information and guidance will be provided in practical classes and via the course Blackboard site during semester. </p>\n<p><strong>Assignment 1: Draft Conservation Project Plan: Defining Your Project</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1200 words maximum – 15%</strong></p>\n<p>The draft of the first sections of your conservation project plan will be submitted as Assignment 1.

Project team and interested parties</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on these two focal values, describe and justify the key partners and interested parties in the development and implement of a conservation management plan for this focal value in this region (page 15). The text should make it clear which organisation or group would be leading the plan and should supported by a table summarising the role of each party (project team, advisor, decision maker, funder, affected party or other), the skills, experience or resources they would contribute, and what their main priorities or concerns might be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3.

Monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the situation model that you have updated for Part 6, select and justify a series of indicators to measure that will help you monitor and evaluate the performance of your project (page 47). Indicators should be measurable, reliably linked to the value, outcome, or action that they are indicating, and sensitive to changes within the timeframe of your project.</li>\n<li>The indicators should include those that allow you to identify whether your goal is achieved, but also allow you to monitor intermediate steps and outcomes</li>\n<li>Include a table (supported by text) identifying each indicator, what methods will be used to measure it, and the current and desirable states of that indicator</li>\n<li>Include commentary on any monitoring outcomes that would suggest that the project is not on track and what type of review that these suboptimal outcomes should trigger</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>8. Caveats and operational logistics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Briefly summarise any caveats, such as which assumptions are being made? What needs to occur outside of the actions the project team can take?</li>\n<li>Consider what resources and further plans will be needed to carry out your project in terms of human capacity, skills and other non-financial resources, funding, and social safeguards (page 53)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong> </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
