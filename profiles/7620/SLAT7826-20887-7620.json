You do not need to explain every detail of the class. Focus on your own thinking, questions, and learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Write <strong>one paragraph</strong> that includes <strong>Question 1 (required)</strong> and <strong>at least two</strong> other questions below. You do <strong>not</strong> need to answer all the questions. Please put the word count at the end of your answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Q1. Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) (Example from Week 1)</strong></p>\n<p>Think about one <strong>specific moment</strong> in this week’s seminar (for example: an activity, example, or discussion) that affected your view of CLT.</p>\n<p>In your reflection, explain:</p>\n<p>·      What you thought about CLT <em>before</em> the seminar;</p>\n<p>·      What changed, became unclear, or stayed the same;</p>\n<p>·      How this relates to your own learning or teaching experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Choose at least two of the following:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q2.</strong> One idea that surprised or confused you. Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Q3.</strong> One way your understanding changed (or did not change). What caused this?</p>\n<p><strong>Q4.</strong> One question you still have, and why it is important to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5.</strong> How does this seminar connect to your identity as a language teacher or professional?</p>\n<p><strong>Q6.</strong> One class activity that helped your learning (or did not help). Explain why.</p>\n<p><strong>Q7.</strong> One suggestion for the next class that would support your learning.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>What we are looking for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference to <strong>your own class experience</strong>, not general theory</li>\n<li>Evidence of <strong>thinking, questioning, or change</strong>, not polished answers</li>\n<li>Clear links between beliefs, experiences, and future action</li>\n<li>Language accuracy is less important than clarity and reflection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reflection and AI Use</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reflection tasks in this course are designed to support </strong><em>your own learning process</em>, including moments of uncertainty, difficulty, or change in understanding. You may use AI tools <strong>after engaging with the task yourself</strong> to clarify concepts or check understanding, however it may not be useful to utilise AI to generate reflective responses, personal insights, or action plans on your behalf. Reflections must represent <strong>your own experiences and thinking</strong>, not polished or generic responses. These tasks are assessed for engagement and evidence of learning, not writing perfection. If you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate, please ask your instructor.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 – Reading assignment (7 points)</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this task <strong>is to prepare for class each week. You will be asked to read the assigned reading and answer a few questions about the key concepts/main points in the reading. </strong>The questions will help you determine where to focus your class preparation. Some readings are available in the Class Readings folder within the Learning Resources folder on Blackboard. For the readings which are not available in the BlackBoard folder or UQ Extend, you will go to the High Use area in the library.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI for Reading Tasks</strong></p>\n<p>Pre-reading tasks are designed to support your <em>own engagement</em> with the assigned texts and preparation for class. You are expected to complete the readings on your own. You may use AI <strong>after reading</strong> to clarify difficult concepts, check understanding of key terms, or generate follow-up questions. It may not be useful to utilise AI to <strong>generate pre-reading responses, or produce reflections or questions presented as your own thinking</strong>. These tasks value your questions and uncertainties, not polished answers. If you are unsure about appropriate AI use, please ask your instructor.</p>\n<p><strong>Further IMPORTANT INFORMATION (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The due date of the weekly assignment is <strong>1pm on Wednesday for all classes.</strong> The assignment site will become available every Thursday.</li>\n<li>If a technical failure occurs when you are submitting your assignment on INSPERA (BEFORE the due date), please take clear screenshots of the issue and send them directly to the course coordinator and your instructor with an explanation of the problem. The course coordinator will advise accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Marking and grading information</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Your entry is assessed according to the rubric available in the Blackboard for the Reflection and the Reading Assignment.</li>\n<li>If you complete both the Reflection and Reading Assignments with high quality, you will receive the full 10 marks (3 marks for the Reflection and 7 marks for the Reading Assignment).</li>\n<li>There are 12 assignments in total. <strong>You will get the 10 best scores out of 12 assignments.</strong> If you receive 10 each week, you won't have to complete the final two assessments. Or your score for all 12 weeks' assignments will NOT be totalled, but <strong>only the 10 best scores will be considered for the final marks.</strong></li>\n<li>The maximum of the total 10 assignments is 100, which will be converted to 10.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Statement on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may help students complete this assessment task.

Task Description:</strong> </p>\n<p>This assessment demonstrates how students understand and apply the concepts of four basic types of communicative competence (i.e., sociolinguistic competence, strategic competence, grammatical competence, and discourse competence), as well as the key concepts of CLT and TBLT. It further seeks to challenge the student to review two original activities, and then revise the two activities, which will be used in a Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) curriculum of <strong>the local context</strong>. (TBLT – a strong version of CLT) </p>\n<p><strong>2. Task Requirements: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part 1. Observation and Description of the context (750 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Choose one of the Free English Language Classes in Brisbane. Attend the class and describe the context you will be implementing the activities you are developing for this assignment in detail. Include information about the following: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Target students – Who are they? What is their age level? What is their proficiency level? (Explain what this level means in more detail by providing examples.) What is their purpose of learning the target language? Do you know what their personal interests might be? </li>\n<li>Learning environment – Where are the target students studying? Are they studying at a school, university, or language institute level? What kind of learning facilities are available? What kind of materials and equipment are available? Who is their teacher? </li>\n<li>Chosen Materials– Where are the materials selected for review from? </li>\n<li>Additional information: Is there any other information you think will help us better understand your context?   </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Review of two original activities (500 words for each review) </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Choose</em> two activities available from commercial materials (both hard and online). For the four types of communicative competence, each selected activity should focus on a different type.</li>\n<li><em>Scan</em> or add an image of both activities to your reviews.</li>\n<li><em>Review</em> each activity by responding to the following questions: </li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>To what extent can each activity be described as communicative? Justify your response and provide evidence from each activity. </li>\n<li>How will learners’ communicative competence be developed through this activity? Justify your response.  </li>\n<li>What principles of CLT and TBLT or features of CLT and TBLT methodology are involved and are not involved? </li>\n<li>How does each activity fulfil or not fulfil the criteria of the task proposed by Ellis (2003)? </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 3: Revise original activities for your context (No word count) </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revise the two activities into real-world tasks for a TBLT-based curriculum in your context.  </li>\n<li>Remember to select different competences to focus on for each of the two activities.  </li>\n<li>Along with the revised activity sheet, please use the attached coversheet to provide additional information. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 4: Provide rationale for your revised activities (500 words for each revised activity) </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain and provide evidence from your revised activities about how they meet Ellis’ task criteria and CLT/TBLT principles. </li>\n<li>Summarise your revision of the activities and explain how your adapted activities will enhance the particular competence and how the other three competencies will be developed.   </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Other notes:  </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are not allowed to use the tasks or activities from the SLAT7826 class. </li>\n<li>It is important to refer to the research articles/book chapters revised in class and cite them when discussing the features/principles of CLT and TBLT, as well as competencies.  </li>\n<li>You can have a look at some examples of Activity sheets done by students from previous years to have an idea of how this assignment can be done. But don’t consider them as perfect. We encourage you to be creative when making your own activity sheets. Up to 2026, there was no requirement for class observation and description of the context where you observed in the assessment. <strong>The context description in the sample tasks submitted prior to 2026 is not relevant to the assessment from 2026 onwards.</strong></li>\n<li>You need to provide a signature of the instructor you observed, with the date of your observation, and include it in the submission materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Please assess your work using the self-assessment sheet and include it in your submission. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Please provide a proof your attendance to the local language class with a signature of the instructor and date (a template will be provided).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.

For example, within topic 1, “Issues of native speaker in teaching English as an international language,” you might discuss the status of native and non-native English-speaking teachers in teaching English as an international language, or whether native-speaker<em> competence should be the model for English teaching and learning.</em></li>\n<li>Once you have decided on a specific topic for your position paper, create an outline for the paper. <strong>Relying upon literature, theories introduced in the course, and your experience, your position paper should include:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>An introduction paragraph that introduces the broad topic and the more specific topic. The intro should have <strong>a clear thesis statement </strong>that clearly states the key argument/viewpoint you want to prove/disprove in your position paper. You may choose to agree or disagree or discuss both sides of a topic/issue. In this intro paragraph, you may also specify how the position paper is organised to provide optimal guidance to the reader.</li>\n<li>The body of your position paper should include:</li>\n<li>Explanations/definitions of all key terms/concepts that you consider essential for the reader to understand your arguments. You need to rely on the literature related to your chosen topic to provide appropriate explanations of terms. You need to cite the literature when providing the definition.</li>\n<li>Several main arguments support your thesis statement. For these arguments, you need to review findings from at least three to five empirical research papers that have been done on the topic you choose and use them to support your arguments. Also, <strong>do not just list these studies</strong>. Show your engagement with the literature on the chosen topic by discussing (where possible)</li>\n<li>similarities and differences among the studies with regard to your chosen topic</li>\n<li>The conclusions or results obtained from these studies and how they might relate to the concepts/theories discussed in the course, as well as your own understanding and experience of the topic.</li>\n<li>When you include your own personal understanding and experiences, you should go beyond just your “personal thoughts” and rather explore and examine the topic as you have come to understand it from the materials provided in the course, in addition to your own journey in learning and teaching second languages. When appropriate, provide examples to support your argument</li>\n<li>A concluding paragraph that summarises key points in the position paper</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Some other notes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use of headings: </strong>You can use headings and subheadings in your position paper to better guide the reader, but this is not compulsory. If you think the different parts of your position paper flow together well without headings, that should be fine.</li>\n<li>Our course Padlet site provides some tips: <a href=\"https://padlet.com/dian0007/slat7826week12\">https://padlet.com/dian0007/slat7826week12</a></li>\n<li>STILL HAVE QUESTIONS? PLEASE CONTACT US!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Submission:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write the number of words at the end of your essay.</li>\n<li>Fill in the self-assessment sheet (given in class and available in BB) and submit it online.</li>\n<li>No hard copy is required.</li>\n<li>Check the similarity score by submitting your draft essay to Turnitin TRIAL before submitting your final copy.</li>\n<li>You must submit your final essay to Turnitin's FINAL site.</li>\n<li>If you submit to the wrong site, your assessment will NOT be marked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 2 Interview (10 mins)</strong></p>\n<p>Students explain how they wrote the document, how they planned it, the decisions they made, and the use of AI. Then, to personalise the interview to the students' assignment, a scenario could be given based on their topic. </p>\n<p><strong>Further IMPORTANT INFORMATION (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Students must attend the interview</strong>. An interview is assessed pass/fail, but without attending the interview or passing it, students cannot <strong>pass this assessment.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Statement on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of the assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students must demonstrate detailed understanding of their written submission during the in-person interview, without the use of AI or MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
