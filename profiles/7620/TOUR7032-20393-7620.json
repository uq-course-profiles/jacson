You are required to first choose a THE-related organisation located in Australia. You must then identify four peer-reviewed journal articles relevant to your organisation, specifically addressing: (1) market segmentation and (2) distribution channels.</p>\n<p>The insights gained from these four journal articles should help you understand the business context, industry competition, customer niche markets, and distribution channels relevant to your chosen organisation. You are required to critically review these four articles (published after 2020), provide a systematic analysis, and incorporate and reflect on their recommendations in relation to your selected organisation.</p>\n<p>The key objective of this assessment is to learn from published research and leverage existing knowledge to design an effective and evidence-based marketing strategy for the organisation.</p>\n<p>Please note that the chosen organisation will be used across Assessments 1, 2, and 3. Assessments 1 and 2 are individual tasks, while Assessment 3 is team-based.
