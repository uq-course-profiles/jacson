Your data set should NOT be from a survey you have conducted yourself. </strong></li>\n<li>Three research questions that will help shape the direction of your story.</li>\n<li>The names and contact details of five authoritative sources who can be interviewed for the story.</li>\n<li>Two examples of published visualisations that might inspire your own visualisation (with links and/or screenshots).</li>\n<li>A brief timeline outlining your approach to compiling the story.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A template will be provided on Blackboard. Please remember that, while you should attempt to be thorough, imaginative and forward-thinking about your research project before submitting the pitch, the nature of such projects is that they will evolve throughout the research and writing process. You may make alterations to the project direction as you begin to compile your research and based on the feedback you will receive from your tutor. </p>\n<p>Students will be assessed using the rubric, available in on Blackboard, which includes the weightings of each of the assessment categories. Feedback on draft submissions will be available in designated tutorial workshops.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Within the pitch, students are advised that the use of AI or Machine Translation (MT) technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. However, students may conceptualise an investigation that uses AI as a primary or secondary source, and may include their intent to do so within this assessment without penalty. For more information about how AI can be used in Assessment 2 and 3, please refer to those assessment items. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
