You do not need to explain every detail. Focus on your own thinking, questions, and learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Write <strong>one paragraph</strong> that includes <strong>Question 1 (required)</strong> and <strong>at least two</strong> other questions below. You do <strong>not</strong> need to answer all the questions. Please put the word count at the end of your answer.</p>\n<p>Use the guiding questions below to write a <strong>critical reflection</strong> that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your <strong>personal response</strong> to the class (thoughts, reactions, or feelings),</li>\n<li>analysis of <strong>why</strong> you responded in this way,</li>\n<li>reflection on <strong>what has influenced your thinking</strong> (e.g., prior experience, beliefs, or expectations),</li>\n<li><strong>one concrete action</strong> you would take in future teaching or learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q1. Testing and assessment (Week 1 content)</strong></p>\n<p>Identify <strong>one specific moment</strong> from this week’s class (e.g. an example, activity, comment, or discussion) that influenced your understanding of testing or assessment.</p>\n<p>In your reflection, explain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what you <em>initially believed</em> about testing/assessment before the seminar,</li>\n<li>what changed, was challenged, or became more complex for you,</li>\n<li>how this may influence a <strong>specific decision</strong> you would make in your future teaching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Choose at least two of the following:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Describe one idea that surprised or unsettled you. Why did you react this way?</p>\n<p><strong>Q3</strong>. Identify something you thought you already understood, but which you now see differently or more clearly. What caused this shift?</p>\n<p><strong>Q4</strong>. Explain your current belief about testing and assessment. What experiences (inside or outside the seminar) seem to shape this belief?</p>\n<p><strong>Q5</strong>. Describe how this seminar connects to your developing identity as a language teacher or professional.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Identify one aspect of the seminar that supported or hindered your learning. Why did it affect you in this way?</p>\n<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Name one concept, example, or question you would like to explore further, and explain why it matters to your learning.</p>\n<p> <strong>What we are looking for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference to <strong>your own class experience</strong>, not general theory</li>\n<li>Evidence of <strong>thinking, questioning, or change</strong>, not polished answers</li>\n<li>Clear links between beliefs, experiences, and future action</li>\n<li>Language accuracy is less important than clarity and reflection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reflection and AI Use</strong></p>\n<p>Reflection tasks in this course are designed to support <em>your own learning process</em>, including moments of uncertainty, difficulty, or change in understanding. You may use AI tools <strong>after engaging with the task yourself</strong> to clarify concepts or check understanding, however it may not be useful to utilise AI to generate reflective responses, personal insights, or action plans on your behalf. Reflections must represent <strong>your own experiences and thinking</strong>, not polished or generic responses. These tasks are assessed for engagement and evidence of learning, not writing perfection. If you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate, please ask your instructor.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 – Reading (7 points)</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this task is to prepare for upcoming lectures and workshops.</p>\n<p> <strong>Section 1) (4 points)</strong> – Weekly Reading: Each week, you will be assigned a reading (or multiple readings) to prepare for the classes ahead. The readings will be made available to you via the course Blackboard site, along with a list of questions about the key concepts/main points of the assigned chapters/papers. The questions have been designed to guide and focus your reading. You need to answer the weekly set of questions briefly but comprehensively in writing.</p>\n<p> <strong>Section 2)</strong> <strong>(3 points) </strong>– Article for Article Presentation. Each week, you will complete a written response to the assigned article. <strong>Section 2) starts in Week 2.</strong>The task has <strong>two clearly labelled parts</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Part A: Analytical Summary</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Part B: Critical Evaluation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This task assesses your ability to <strong>read language testing/assessment research critically and selectively</strong>, not to reproduce article content.</p>\n<p><strong>Part A: Analytical Summary (Approx. 100-200 words)</strong></p>\n<p>The summary should explain <strong>what the study contributes to the field</strong>, rather than retelling the article in detail.</p>\n<p>Your summary should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the <strong>purpose</strong> of the study and its <strong>main contribution</strong></li>\n<li>Briefly indicate the <strong>theoretical orientation, data, and method</strong> (only where necessary)</li>\n<li>Highlight the <strong>key findings or arguments</strong> that matter for applied linguistics</li>\n<li>✔ Be selective: a strong summary shows <em>why the study matters</em>, not everything the authors did.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br/></h3>\n<p><strong>Part B: Critical Evaluation (Approx. 100-150 words)</strong></p>\n<p>The critique is <strong>your evaluation of the article</strong>, not a restatement of the authors’ own limitations. You are expected to demonstrate <strong>independent scholarly judgement</strong>, supported by evidence from the text. You do <strong>not</strong> need to address all of the questions below. Select those most relevant to the article.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible areas for critique include:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clarity and framing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the title appropriate and clear?</li>\n<li>Is the abstract accurate and representative?</li>\n<li>Is the purpose of the study clearly stated?</li>\n<li>Are any claims ambiguous, overstated, or underdeveloped?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Engagement with the field</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the literature review relevant and well-selected?</li>\n<li>Are any sources misinterpreted or misrepresented?</li>\n<li>Are important perspectives under- or over-emphasised?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evaluation of empirical research (if applicable)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the research question important for applied linguistics?</li>\n<li>Are the study design, methods, and unit of analysis appropriate?</li>\n<li>Do the data and analysis support the claims made?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Support your critique with specific examples from the article</strong> (e.g., sections or page numbers).</p>\n<p><strong>Expectations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly label <strong>Part A (Summary)</strong> and <strong>Part B (Critical Evaluation)</strong></li>\n<li>Focus on <strong>analysis and judgement</strong>, not description,</li>\n<li>Use evidence from the article to support your points,</li>\n<li>Writing clarity matters, but <strong>depth of thinking</strong> matters more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Further IMPORTANT INFORMATION (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The due date of the weekly assignment is <strong>1 pm on Tuesday for all classes. The assignment site is available every Thursday.</strong></li>\n<li>If a technical failure occurs when you are submitting your assignment on INSPERA (BEFORE the due date), please take clear screenshots of the issue and send them directly to the course coordinator and your instructor with an explanation of the problem. The course coordinator will advise accordingly.</li>\n<li>If sick/absent, apply for an extension. <strong>Marking and grading for the assignment</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Marks</strong></li>\n<li>If you complete both the Reflection and Reading Assignments with high quality, you will receive the full 10 marks (3 marks for the Reflection and 7 marks for the Reading Assignment).</li>\n<li>Your entry is assessed according to the rubric in the Blackboard for each type of assessment.</li>\n<li>There are 11 assignments in total. You will get the 10 best scores out of 11 assignments. If you receive 10 each week, you won't have to complete the final two assessments. Or your score for all 11 weeks' assignments will NOT be totalled, but only the 10 best scores will be considered for the final marks. Your entry of the two tasks (i.e., reflection and answers to the questions) will be credited to your assessment. You are expected to submit 10 reflections and reading assignments at a minimum (out of 11). The maximum assignment score for each week is 10. The maximum of the total 10 assignments is 100, which will be converted to 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reflection and AI Use</strong></p>\n<p>Reflection tasks in this course are designed to support <em>your own learning process</em>, including moments of uncertainty, difficulty, or change in understanding.

Provide information that is beneficial to other educators interested in replicating the test.</li>\n<li>Rationale for test content, addressing what to include in the test (test content) and how to administer it. While detailed summaries aren't necessary, ensure there is enough explanation to understand the rationale behind your design decisions. If applicable, reference the \"Checklist for evaluating usefulness\" (Bachman &amp; Palmer, 1996).</li>\n<li>Brief report on pilot testing, outlining any adjustments made to the test content following pilot testing. Expected length: 2-3 pages (1.5/double spacing, 12-point font specified below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> 2. Test Items (Test Paper):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design test papers with length in mind, ensuring they align with seminar discussions. Larger groups are expected to produce more test items.</li>\n<li>Ensure the test assesses communicative language ability rather than discrete grammar knowledge. Tasks should simulate real-life scenarios for test-takers to engage with.</li>\n<li>Present the test well-organised to leave a positive impression on test-takers. Consolidate all test items assessing different skills into one document.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Guidelines for Test Users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide clear instructions for test administrators and assessors to ensure consistent administration and assessment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4</strong>.    <strong>Test Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blueprint of the test, referencing provided sample specifications and discussing them in seminars.

Task Description:</strong> </p>\n<p>This assessment comprises two parts – a Position paper (1500 words) and an interview</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1 Position paper</strong></p>\n<p>Choose one of the following topics.</p>\n<p>1) Assessing communicative language ability</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the issues in the assessment of communicative language ability and propose potential solutions to those issues</li>\n<li>Use your own teaching/learning experience to illustrate and strengthen your argument</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) Social, policy, and ethical considerations in language testing and assessment (here, you can choose to focus on one topic only, that is, either social or policy or ethical considerations)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the relevant issues in second language assessment and suggest potential solutions</li>\n<li>Discuss the implications of those issues for your teaching practice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3) Classroom-based assessments</p>\n<p><strong>Please read the following instructions carefully before you start working on your position paper. </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>This should be a position paper<strong> </strong>that presents a clear, arguable opinion on a specific issue, using well-researched facts, evidence, and logical reasoning to persuade the audience that your stance is valid, often addressing counterarguments to strengthen the case. <strong>Please note that the topics we give you are very broad; once you’ve picked a topic that you’re interested in, you will need to narrow it down and decide on a more specific topic for your position paper.</strong></li>\n<li> To do this, you will need to understand the literature on the topic. For example, within topic 1, “Assessing communicative language ability”, you need to show your understanding of communicative language ability, and you may like to focus on classroom assessment or the context of large commercial tests (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL).</li>\n<li>Once you have decided on a specific topic for your position paper, create an outline for the paper. <strong>Relying upon literature, theories introduced in the course, and your experience, your position paper should include:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>An introduction paragraph that introduces the broad topic and the more specific topic. The intro should have <strong>a clear thesis statement </strong>that clearly states the key argument/viewpoint you want to prove/disprove in your position paper. You may choose to agree or disagree or discuss both sides of a topic/issue. In this intro paragraph, you may also specify how the position paper is organised to provide optimal guidance to the reader.</li>\n<li>The body of your position paper should include:</li>\n<li>Explanations/definitions of all key terms/concepts that you consider essential for the reader to understand your arguments. You need to rely on the literature related to your chosen topic to provide appropriate explanations of terms. You need to cite the literature when providing the definition.</li>\n<li>Several main arguments support your thesis statement. For these arguments, you need to review findings from at least three to five empirical research papers that have been done on the topic you choose and use them to support your arguments. Also, <strong>do not just list these studies</strong>. Show your engagement with the literature on the chosen topic by discussing (where possible)</li>\n<li>similarities and differences among the studies with regard to your chosen topic</li>\n<li>The conclusions or results obtained from these studies and how they might relate to the concepts/theories discussed in the course, as well as your own understanding and experience of the topic.</li>\n<li>When you include your own personal understanding and experiences, you should go beyond just your “personal thoughts” and rather explore and examine the topic as you have come to understand it from the materials provided in the course, in addition to your own journey in learning and teaching second languages. When appropriate, provide examples to support your argument</li>\n<li>A concluding paragraph that summarises key points in the position paper</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Some other notes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use of headings: </strong>You can use headings and subheadings in your position paper to better guide the reader, but this is not compulsory. If you think the different parts of your position paper flow together well without headings, that should be fine.</li>\n<li>Our course Padlet site provides some tips: <a href=\"https://padlet.com/dian0007/slat7826week12\">https://padlet.com/dian0007/slat7826week12</a></li>\n<li>STILL HAVE QUESTIONS?

Submission:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write the number of words at the end of your essay.</li>\n<li>Fill in the self-assessment sheet (given in class and available in BB) and submit it online.</li>\n<li>No hard copy is required.</li>\n<li>Check the similarity score by submitting your draft essay to Turnitin TRIAL before submitting your final copy.</li>\n<li>You must submit your final essay to Turnitin's FINAL site.</li>\n<li>If you submit to the wrong site, your assessment will NOT be marked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 2 Interview (10 mins)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Students explain how they wrote the document, how they planned it, the decisions they made, and the use of AI. Then, to personalise the interview to the students' assignment, a scenario could be given based on their topic. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Further IMPORTANT INFORMATION (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Students must attend the interview</strong>. An interview is assessed pass/fail, but without attending the interview or passing it, students cannot <strong>pass this assessment.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Statement on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of the assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
