Based on course lectures, reading materials, and relevant data sources, this economic profile will include analyses of the patterns, activities, infrastructure conditions, land use characteristics, and related factors to identify the precinct’s functional role within the wider regional economy.</p>\n<p>This assessment will require a presentation made to the cohort (communicated via structured analysis and data visualisation) that articulates the realistic pathways for precinct-level economic development, showcasing analytical depth, reasoning and clarity of strategic insight, and formation of an evidentiary foundation for the individual policy memo (Assessment 2).</p>\n<p>Besides the minimum requirements, each group is encouraged to think outside the box in terms of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Content curation: identify unique materials to highlight comparative advantages and disadvantages for the assigned industry</li>\n<li>Content delivery: you will be asked to present the regional economic profile using business intelligence (BI) tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment will be graded by groups based on both content and delivery: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrate sufficient understanding of economic concepts</li>\n<li>Demonstrate a clear theme with appropriate analyses</li>\n<li>Showcase effectiveness and creativity in the final deliverable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A 'statement of contribution' is included to declare each group member's contribution to the presentation.

The memorandum must translate economic diagnosis into clear, evidence-based strategic recommendations that enhance the precinct’s long-term economic performance and resilience.</p>\n<p>Moving from analysis to action, students are expected to identify priority opportunities and risks, propose targeted interventions, outline implementation pathways, and recommend measurable performance indicators. The task emphasises policy clarity, feasibility, and sequencing. Engagement with relevant regional planning, economic development, and infrastructure strategies is required, alongside appropriate use of quantitative and qualitative evidence, aided through the practical activities conducted during the course. Apply the knowledge and skills you develop through coursework, as well as thoroughly examine the existing regional economic development plans that underline what may take place in the next seven-year frame.

It differs from ShapingSEQ in the sense that TransformingSEQ focuses on innovation, global competitiveness, smartness, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>The memorandum will be submitted individually. You are encouraged to continue working with your group members to develop necessary analyses and acknowledge intellectual properties as a collective in your memorandum.  </p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
