Goal setting and targeted approaches to re-engage learners (APST 3.5, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4). In this lecture, preservice teachers learn about the importance of goals in motivation and engagement, characteristic of effective (SMART) goals, how to collaborate to set goals for targeted groups of students, and how to provide targeted supports for groups of learners who share similar reasons for disengagement or share similar behaviours of concern. We also discuss how to track progress and provide feedback/ reinforcement against goals, and strategies to use when goals aren’t being achieved (Core Content 3.3.1)",
