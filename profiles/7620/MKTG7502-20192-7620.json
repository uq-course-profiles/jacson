Tutorial 12 will be used <strong>only</strong> for groups that missed their presentation in Tutorials 10 and 11 (Weeks 11 and 12).</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Assessment.</strong> It is important that groups work well together and that everyone does their fair share of the work. This course uses the UQ Group Peer Assessment tool called Buddycheck. <strong>All students</strong> <strong>must complete Buddycheck</strong> on Blackboard.  If the peer assessment result indicates that a team member has not been doing their fair share of the work, their <em>marks may be adjusted downward</em> based on peer assessment results. Peer assessment forms are due by the end of the day after your project presentation. To facilitate a shared understanding about how the team will function, team members should agree on a team charter for how the team will operate (a model team charter will be provided as a starter for your team). <strong>If your group is having problems, see your tutor as early as possible</strong>. If you fear that your team may assess you unfairly, it is important to discuss this with your tutor well before the project is finished. </p>\n<p>For help with how to effectively function in teams by building teams and managing team conflict see the online edX course “Working in Teams: A Practical Guide” <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/working-in-teams-a-practical-guide\">www.edx.org/course/working-in-teams-a-practical-guide</a> (link on the Blackboard website).</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.
