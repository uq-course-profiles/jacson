Your aim is to develop a reflective argument about the <em>critical approach</em>: what it is, why it matters, what it can offer for teaching and learning, and what its limitations are. You are encouraged to connect your reflection to your own background, language learning experiences, and future career goals.</p>\n<p>Your reflection should draw on the course readings, key ideas and theories discussed in lectures, and the discussions and activities from tutorials. Rather than writing a week-by-week summary, it will be more effective to organise your reflection around a few key themes.</p>\n<p>You are welcome to include readings beyond the course materials. For authors who are part of the course readings, you do not need full references—simply use the author’s surname and year (e.g., Pennycook, 2021).</p>\n<p>This is not an evaluation of the course or the teaching. However, you are encouraged to think critically. If you disagree with certain ideas, concepts, or readings, you may explain and reflect on those disagreements in a constructive way.</p>\n<p>Overall, your aim is to show how the first five weeks of the course have helped you grow—intellectually, theoretically, pedagogically, ethically, and socially.</p>\n<p>The following questions are provided as guidance only. You do not need to answer all of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What topics, ideas, and theories were introduced in the first five weeks?</li>\n<li>How has your understanding of “critical” thinking and pedagogy changed?</li>\n<li>What have you learned, and how does it compare with your initial expectations?</li>\n<li>How can you bring your learning together in a meaningful way?</li>\n<li>How does this learning connect to the course learning outcomes?</li>\n<li>How might this learning support you as a student, a teacher, and a member of society?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You are welcome to use AI for this assignment, but you have to acknowledge how you used it and what kind of interaction you had with AI.</p>\n<p>There is no prescribed structure for the assignment. However, a typical structure of introduction, development and conclusion is expected.</p>\n<p>You will make sure you have addressed all criteria for the assessment task.</p>\n<p>As this is a personal critical reflection of your learning, it should preferably be written in the first person. This will foreground your authorial voice. We would encourage you to briefly record your reflection each week as you prepare so this assignment becomes more manageable and efficient.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

With the development of computer and information technology, language learning also now often takes place through websites and other online materials. Like printed textbooks, language-learning websites can act as powerful sources of knowledge, presenting particular perspectives and ways of understanding the world.</p>\n<p>Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) argues that all texts carry messages about how society and people are represented. When texts are produced by governments or other institutions, these messages are often carefully selected and purposeful. Through the ideologies embedded in discourse, texts can reveal attitudes, values, power relations, and social orientations related to both the target language (English) and the wider society or online community.</p>\n<p>In this assessment, you will analyse texts from textbooks, websites, or media to identify these issues. For practical reasons, all texts must be in English. Norman Fairclough’s work provides the main framework for CDA, and the course will introduce you to examples of CDA from different contexts.</p>\n<p>You will be randomly assigned one or more texts from different sources to analyse using Fairclough’s CDA framework. To complete the assignment successfully, you should address the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What main discourse(s) are constructed in the text(s)? (e.g. gender, national identity)</li>\n<li>How are these discourses supported through linguistic and textual features at different levels?</li>\n<li>What social factors help explain the discourse?</li>\n<li>What do we know about the production (who created the text, where, and in what form), dissemination (how it is shared), and consumption (who the audience is)?</li>\n<li>How does Fairclough’s CDA framework help identify and analyse the discourse?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The word count does not include the analysed text(s), which should be included as an appendix.</p>\n<p>You may use AI tools for this assignment, but you must clearly acknowledge how you used them and describe the type of interaction you had with AI.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
