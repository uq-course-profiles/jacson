The assessment comprises two components of individual work and one component of group work. Electronic devices are only permitted for use in the group component of the assessment activity. Students using electronic devices to complete individual items of the assessment will be graded at zero for that week and asked to leave the classroom. All individual work must be submitted on Blackboard prior to conclusion of the class.</p>\n<p>Preparation for this assessment task will take place in weeks 1-4 of the course. It is strongly advised that students attend these classes or listen to seminar recordings to ensure they are well prepared for completing the assessment. Students who do not undertake this preparation will find the assessment task to be a difficult one. </p>\n<p>Task description</p>\n<p>Students will be assessed on their ability to use key course concepts for critiquing an AI-generated PESTEL, Porter, and VRIN analysis of a case study organisation. Students will not be pre-informed on the specific case study organisation. The assessment will proceed as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Component #1</strong> (Individual): Individual readiness test</p>\n<p>Students will be provided with an AI generated PESTEL, Porter, or VRIN analysis of a case study organisation. They will be required to use key course concepts introduced in weeks 2-4 to critique the quality of the AI generated output. No electronic materials are permitted for this component of the assessment. Students are encouraged to bring along written notes to assist in their completion of this task. One double-sided A4 handwritten sheet of course notes is permitted. These notes are to be written only in English. Notes compiled in another language will be removed by the teaching team.</p>\n<p><strong>Component #2</strong> (Group): Carnival of AI Group assessment</p>\n<p>Students will be placed into random groups. They will play assigned roles for producing an AI-generated PESTEL, Porter, and VRIN analysis of a case study organisation. Groups will be assessed on their efforts in engaging in the spirit of the carnival by playing roles, leveraging props, and incorporating laughter to celebrate the role of AI in the information production process.</p>\n<p><strong>Component #3 </strong>(Individual): Individual Post-Activity Reflection</p>\n<p>Students will be provided stimulus for reflecting on the experience of using AI in the group component of the assessment process. They will be asked to reflect on the role of AI in what they produced during the carnival, as well as to reflect on what that reflection informs them on their use of AI in the future. No electronic materials are permitted for this component of the assessment. Students are encouraged to incorporate comments written on whiteboards during the group component of the assessment process for informing their reflection.</p>\n<p>You will have FOUR opportunities to be assessed on your performance. Your overall result will be comprised as follows:</p>\n<p>·      Your best three out of four individual readiness assessment tests (3 x 5% = 15%);</p>\n<p>·      Your best three out of four group Carnival of AI assessment results (3 x 3.33% = 10%)</p>\n<p>·      Your best three out of four individual reflections (3 x 5% = 15%)</p>\n<p>Students who are absent for a week of assessment will receive a mark of zero.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Organisations represent a complex environment, featuring a mix of actors with different motivations, levels of influence, and bases of power. These dynamics are most apparent during periods of organisational restructuring, where textbook models of best practice in organisational design are often rendered impossible by clashes between different actors motivated by competing interests. Students will be introduced to a hypothetical organisation, Millennium Airlines, which is restructuring to ensure its ongoing competitiveness in the face of challenging circumstances in its external and internal environment. Using information about the organisation and theory on organisational politics and structure, students will recommend a restructure which accounts for political realities of the organisation by completing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a zoom-style format (only) video brief to a member of the organisation's Executive which justifies their recommended structure</li>\n<li>a hierarchical diagram (only) of an ideal structure for the organisation</li>\n<li>a hierarchical diagram (only) of a recommended structure for the organisation</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Video briefs must be in a face-to-face, zoom-style format.
