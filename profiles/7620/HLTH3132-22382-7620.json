The group memberships identified have a meaningful role to play in the person’s life in the context of their health issue, are represented accurately (as they would present in the life of a person with the health issue), and judgements/ratings are coherent both within the group (e.g., i.e., across the 4 quality criteria) and between the groups (i.e., compatibilities). </p>\n<p>(B) Quality of the Written Commentary [20%]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client presentation [5%] Client and their network description should demonstrate knowledge of the health issue and should align with the group memberships you have identified in their network (family, peers, cultural, community, health professional, online, etc)  </li>\n<li>Conceptual understanding and depth of analysis [15%]. (i) Demonstrates clear grasp of the social identity approach to health as it applies to the client’s health issue, and accurately explains how identity processes related to each group’s circumstances, norms and behaviour will impact the person and their management of the health issue. (ii) Critically evaluates both positive and negative influences and roles of each group and an understanding of identity dynamics. (iii) Provides a convincing explanation of how identity processes reflected in the map shape the client’s real world health experience and management of their health issue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(C) Clarity and communication [5%]. The visual map is easy to process/understand, interpret, and complements the analysis. The written commentary is well-structured, clear and persuasive. </p>\n<p>These are also detailed in the marking criteria provided and will be discussed in your first tutorial.  </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
