Groups will be formed in the first three weeks of the semester.</p>\n<p>Additional details on this assessment to be provided on blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Group selection:</strong></p>\n<p>Students will be asked to select their partner within the first three weeks of the course. Details of the selection process will be provided on Blackboard. If assistance is required, please contact the course coordinator. After this period, the coordinator will assign any remaining students to groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Topic (5%) – Uniqueness and Appeal</strong></p>\n<p>This criterion evaluates how engaging and original the topic is. It considers how effectively the topic is presented to the audience, making it interesting and accessible. The rationale for choosing this topic should be clear, with an explanation of its relevance to the audience. The comparison of the two foods should highlight unique aspects, demonstrating why this topic matters and how it relates to current trends, issues, or scientific interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Clarity of Speech (15%) – Communication Skills</strong></p>\n<p>This category assesses the clarity, articulation, and pacing of the presenter’s speech. A logical flow of ideas is critical, with a focus on how well the presenter conveys complex scientific concepts in a concise and understandable manner. The ability to engage the audience through effective speech delivery, without overwhelming them with jargon, will be key. Pace should be appropriate, ensuring that each point is sufficiently elaborated without rushing.</p>\n<p><strong>Content (40%) – Scientific Accuracy &amp; Connection to Lecture Materials</strong></p>\n<p>The content should demonstrate a strong grasp of the scientific principles underlying the comparison of the two foods. This includes:</p>\n<p>The scientific accuracy of explanations related to nutritional values, biochemical processes, or any other relevant scientific aspects.</p>\n<p>Integration of lecture materials to support and explain key points, such as principles of nutrition, food chemistry, or metabolism.</p>\n<p>The use of relevant data, tables, or plots from credible references or similar sources to support and illustrate key comparisons. These visuals should present key metrics (e.g., nutrient content, health impacts, or environmental considerations) that help clarify the differences between the two foods.</p>\n<p><strong>Style and Layout (15%) – Visual Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>This criterion evaluates the quality, clarity, and relevance of the visual aids used. Images, figures, and diagrams should be well-chosen to support the content and enhance understanding, without causing distraction. The design of the slides should be simple, professional, and easy to follow. Text should be legible and concise, with visuals clearly labeled to reinforce key points. Effective use of visuals should improve the audience’s comprehension of complex comparisons and scientific data.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Point of View (20%) – Analysis and Reasoning</strong></p>\n<p>The ability to analyze and interpret the data or information being presented is crucial. This includes:</p>\n<p>Explaining why certain outcomes or observations occur, based on scientific reasoning.</p>\n<p>Providing alternative explanations and discussing different viewpoints where appropriate.</p>\n<p>Demonstrating critical thinking by evaluating the strengths and limitations of the foods being compared, considering aspects such as nutritional value, health benefits, environmental impact, or consumer preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>References (5%) – Evidence and Depth</strong></p>\n<p>The report should cite valid, credible sources to support the scientific arguments made. References should be well-integrated into the narrative, helping to ground the presentation in established research. Depth of discussion is important, with the integration of key studies, scientific papers, or authoritative sources. Citations should be clear, accurate, and appropriately formatted, demonstrating the presenter’s engagement with the relevant literature. The inclusion of data, tables, or plots from credible sources will further strengthen the presentation, showing a solid evidence-based foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>AI use:</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) tools, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI or MT will provide only limited support and guidance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be referenced appropriately.
