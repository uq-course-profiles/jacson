Students are <strong>not permitted to use AI tools to generate answers or complete assessment requirements during the check-in</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, because responsible and transparent use of AI tools is a core learning focus of the course, students <strong>may discuss, explain, or demonstrate prior use (or non-use) of AI tools</strong> as part of the guided professional conversation. This may include showing examples of how AI tools were used during their development process, explaining verification steps, or reflecting on limitations, risks, and decision-making.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the teaching team member may invite a student to <strong>trial or explore an AI tool during the discussion</strong> for learning purposes. Any such use occurs <strong>under supervision</strong> and forms part of the assessment of professional judgement, not task completion.</p>\n<p>Any <strong>unauthorised or deceptive use of AI tools during the check-in</strong>, including attempting to use AI to generate responses in place of explanation or reasoning, may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>What is this task?</strong></p>\n<p>The A1 Individual Progress Check-ins are structured one-on-one conversations with a member of the teaching team. Their purpose is to support your learning by reviewing your current progress, understanding, and decision-making at key points across the semester.</p>\n<p>In each check-in, you will discuss the work you have completed to date and explain how and why you have made particular design and development decisions appropriate to the current stage of the course. These conversations are not only about what is working, but also about identifying challenges, reflecting on feedback, and planning next steps.</p>\n<p>The check-ins are designed to help you develop professional habits of practice, including explaining your work clearly, exercising judgement about priorities and trade-offs, and progressively building independence over time.</p>\n<p><strong>How it is assessed</strong></p>\n<p>Across the semester, you will be assessed on four capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional reasoning and decision-making</li>\n<li>Engagement in guided professional dialogue</li>\n<li>Progressive development and professional autonomy</li>\n<li>Responsible AI decision-making (or justified non-use)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Each capability is assessed as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing (Level 1), Competent (Level 2), or Advanced (Level 3).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Individual Progress Review A1.1 is timed to provide feedback on your progress prior to the Semester 1, 2026 Census (31 March, 2026).</p>\n<p>Your final A1 grade is determined using a standards-based translation process that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>considers capability demonstrated across the semester, and</li>\n<li>requires demonstration of minimum capability by the final check-in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A detailed task sheet and grading criteria (including the standards-based translation process) for this assessment item is available in Blackboard in the Assessment Folder.
