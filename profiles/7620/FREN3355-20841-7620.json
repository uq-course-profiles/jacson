La fin du monde </em>and approved texts on related debates)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If student enrolments are too large to allow for all students to do presentations in class, some students will need to present in other weeks or record their presentations and post on Blackboard. The same due dates will apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Working in teams</strong></p>\n<p>Please note that, although students are marked individually on the criteria, your presentation will work best if you work as a team. For example, you may decide to divide the article into sections for different team members to work on, but your presentation will be stronger if all team members read each other's work and offer feedback and advice. This will make the overall presentation more coherent.</p>\n<p>If one or more group member does not participate with the group (i.e. attending meetings, responding to messages, completing drafts in a timely manner as decided by the group, submitting work as requested), the group member may be removed from the group and required to complete work individually without the benefit of feedback from the other members of the team. It is incumbent upon team members to treat each other professionally and to report to the course coordinator if a member has been non-responsive or non-participatory. If a team member is removed from a group, he or she will be notified in writing by the course coordinator.</p>\n<p>If you have circumstances which prevent you from working in a group, you must formally request permission to complete this assessment item individually by emailing the course coordinator before team assignments are made. Your request should include supporting documentation or refer to an SAPD or application for an extension.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI &amp; MT:</strong> This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
