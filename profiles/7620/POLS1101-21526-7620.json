The questions will focus exclusively on the content of the required readings. Students will be given 10 minutes at the start of the tutorial to complete the quiz by pen and paper. Each quiz will be worth a total of 3 marks, awarded accordingly:</p>\n<p>0 correct answers: 0 marks</p>\n<p>1-3 correct answers: 1 mark</p>\n<p>4-6 correct answers: 2 marks</p>\n<p>7-10 correct answers: 3 marks</p>\n<p><strong>PART B: Tutorial Participation (6%)</strong></p>\n<p>Participation in tutorials is important for developing your analytical, persuasive, and social skills. Participation enables students to strengthen core skills by practising with others, to test ideas, and to see how different perspectives relate to and enhance one another. There are many different ways of participating effectively, including by leading group work, contributing to group work, posing as well as answering questions, and being a positive presence in the classroom. Your tutor will evaluate your participation through the semester on the following scale. If you cannot attend a tutorial, let your tutor know so this can be accounted for:</p>\n<p>6 marks: positive and effective contribution to all/nearly all tutorials</p>\n<p>5 marks: positive and/or effective contribution to all/nearly all tutorials</p>\n<p>4 marks: positive and/or effective contribution to most tutorials</p>\n<p>3 marks: positive and/or effective contribution to at least half of the tutorials</p>\n<p>2 marks: some positive and/or effective contributions</p>\n<p>1 mark: some positive or effective contribution</p>\n<p>Your scores from PART A and PART B will be confirmed to prove a single mark for class preparation and participation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you are not able to attend your tutorial, you may contact your tutor prior to the tutorial for permission to complete a short piece of work by a date agreed with your tutor to register your participation. Permission from your tutor to complete this work will only be granted where there is a valid reason for your absence, and where evidence for the absence is provided. </p>\n<p>For each missed week, record a 4 minute oral reflection on the required readings for that week and send to your tutor. In particular, you should outline one key challenge for Australian politics and/or society that emerges from the topic discussed in the reading: why is this a challenge and what might be done to solve or mitigate it?</p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
