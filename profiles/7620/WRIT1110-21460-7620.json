Students must complete and submit each of these tasks within the 10-minute timeframe allocated in their tutorial and upload their written response to Blackboard.</p>\n<p>To complete Reading Response 9, students must read 2 of their peers' work, attend their tutorial and provide verbal feedback, and submit a peer feedback sheet to their tutor in Week 12 to receive a possible 2 marks.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Consistent preparation for tutorials and engagement with the readings leads to better learning and writing outcomes, and more productive and enjoyable learning experiences. Through responding to set questions, writing students are challenged to consider writerly techniques in an academic and personal way, and gain highly valued and distinctive skills in critical thinking, evidence-based learning, and creative and professional writing-crucial skills required and highly valued by many workplaces. In addition, the final Reading Response task empowers students to develop feedback literacy and improve their editing skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation: </strong>Because of our focus on reading, analysis, and creative writing, we expect students will come to tutorials well-prepared (i.e. having read the set stories and developed some ideas and questions). This will ensure students are individually prepared and ready to respond to a set question or series of discussion prompts provided in class, therefore contributing to class discussions and ensuring each tutorial will be a valuable learning experience. The weekly story (or stories) to be read will be available via Blackboard. To complete Reading Response 9, students must share their work with their peers and read and reflect on their peers' work before class.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.
