The word-count does not include footnotes; however, footnotes are to contain references only and not substantive argument. Assignments that exceed the word count (including the discretionary margin) will attract a penalty of 5 marks for each 100 words or part thereof.</li>\n<li>The topics will be released on the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site at 10:00 am on Monday 16 March 2026 (Week 4).</li>\n<li>The assignment must be uploaded to Turnitin via the \"Assignment\" submission link on the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site by 2:00 pm on Thursday 16 April 2026 (Week 7).</li>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
