The main mode of assessment will vary at each checkpoint. However, all checkpoints require the submission of project documentation. By the end of the semester, this documentation will form the project’s design/requirements document. The final document should be detailed enough for another team to use as a starting point to further design and develop into a working prototype.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Problem Identification</li>\n<li>Interim Critique</li>\n<li>Exhibit and final documentation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Grading and feedback on checkpoints 1 &amp; 2 will be formative, intended to provide students with an understanding of the quality of their work against the criteria, and to inform and support their subsequent work to refine and improve their project based on the feedback. The overall grade for the project will be considered holistically, examining work across the whole lifetime of the project, but with an emphasis in particular on the endpoint and on the quality of the process followed to get there.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p>You take responsibility for fully understanding any work that you submit.

In Studio 3 where we do not have a final examination, this assessment item plays a similar role, where you are required to demonstrate what you have learned across the whole course.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of a portfolio in a design course is for you to gather together examples and evidence of the work that you have done throughout the course. Traditionally, portfolios are collections of work that individuals can share with prospective employers or potential collaborators as examples of the work that they have done. In a course like DECO3800, the work you contribute to your team's outcome will be heavily influenced by your skills and background, as well as by the nature of the project you have worked on. The contents of your portfolio might therefore include design work related to any number of things, including: project inspirations from existing products or services; user research to learn more about the context of use; sketches and schematics relating to data structures; visual designs of interface elements; reports on technology spikes; code snippets to explore functionality, etc.</p>\n<p>A studio portfolio will show off not only what work you have done, but also what you learned as a result of doing it. This reflective component is important so that you can demonstrate deeper learning. Your reflections will feature in this studio portfolio through a combination of how you provide a commentary on the work that you are featuring, along with the inclusion of a reflection section accompanying each topic covered in the portfolio. The reflection will be an opportunity for you to connect the work you have collected for display with what you have learned through working on it.</p>\n<p>In this postgraduate studio, students are expected to \"Critically reflect on the relationship between practical and theoretical aspects of design through detailed examination of project work in relation to published literature\" (Learning Outcome 7).
