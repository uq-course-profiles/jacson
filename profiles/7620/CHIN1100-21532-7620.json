The sign-up will be finalised in Week 12 and the schedule for this interview will be posted on Blackboard. There are two parts to the oral interview: role-play and question-and-answer. This interview is to assess the following aspects of Chinese: pronunciation and fluency; the range/accuracy of grammar and expressions used; quality of content; and ability to ask and answer questions. The interview is also used to assess the ability to comprehend other speakers and to respond appropriately as a listener. <strong>Palm cards are not allowed in oral interviews</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Role-play</strong>: you are expected to perform with your partner one of three role-plays based on the units covered this semester. The scenarios of the role-plays are available on Blackboard. You should prepare ahead for all the role-plays. The details of each role-play given are guides only. Feel free to express your creativity and depart from the details if you so desire. Either way, you will need to extend a bit on the basic framework provided. Your role-play should last 2 to 2.5 minutes (approximately 12-14 lines for each speaker, or 20-25 lines altogether).</p>\n<p><strong>Question-and-answer:</strong> Your assessor(s) will ask you approximately 8 questions. You should respond with an answer of moderate length (that is, not just “yes” or “no”). Try and extend a bit on the questions asked. A list of sample questions is available on Blackboard. You should prepare ahead as most questions will be drawn from this list.</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: Students should contact the Course Coordinator immediately if there are any issues with the pairwork/teamwork or they are experiencing difficulties in their preparation of the interaction component of this assessment task. With the approval of the teaching staff, under some circumstances, the interviews may be conducted individually. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI &amp; MT statement: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
