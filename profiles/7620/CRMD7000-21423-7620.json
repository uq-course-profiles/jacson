            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Students have to attend the full six days of the intensive workshop and participate in the role play simulations and interactive discussions. You then need to reflect on your experience in the first assessment item, the reflective learning journal. In the learning journal, you will be required to present a personal diary of your learning experiences in the CRMD7000 workshop. The diary should not be just a set of “lecture notes” and does not have to be written in chronological order. It should provide 4-6 examples of experiences during the workshop that you found enlightening, interesting, challenging, difficult or puzzling. Reflective writing involves a brief description of the experience, including what you did/said or thought and how others reacted to it. You then reflect on how you felt during the experience and discuss why you think the experience occurred or why you felt a certain way. If appropriate, give examples of how your experience relates to other experiences outside the workshop context from your professional or personal life. You are also required to relate your experiences to the course readings and other academic and practitioner literature on mediation and conflict resolution to further investigate what happened and to draw lessons for similar events in the future. It is essential that you undertake further readings after the workshop and that you reference scholarly literature in your learning journal. The final part of reflective writing is to develop learning or changes in practice and to set up potential experiments for when you encounter a similar situation in the future. This process will be discussed further during class and will be used to debrief role play simulations in the course.</p>\n<p>The journal must also contain at least one reflection on one of the role play exercises in which you were the mediator. Point out what you did well and what you want to improve on and compare your role play experience to the practitioner literature on mediation.</p>\n<p>The word limit for the reflective learning journal is <strong>2500 words</strong>. You are required to use the standard referencing procedures described in the POLSIS Essay Guide. You can write the journal in the first person and you can structure it either chronologically or by topic. Please refer to the assessment criteria sheet for the learning journal before you start writing. You must also copy and paste the assessment criteria sheet at the end of your assignment (last page). This sheet is available on Learn.UQ Blackboard site under Assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>One mark is given for each full day of participation in the workshop. The remaining 24 marks for the assessment item will be attributed according to the marking rubric available on Blackboard UQ.Learn.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reflective writing summary:</strong></p>\n<p>Reflective writing always includes a short and concrete description of a situation, learning activity, behaviour or example (it is helpful if you reflect on a particular intervention that you engaged in as a mediator to actually write down what you said). Then you describe how the situation/activity/discussion impacted on you emotionally and how your behaviour impacted on others involved (in the way that you perceived their reactions or according to their reflections during the debriefing of the experience). You then compare your experience to relevant scholarly literature on the topic (and include references) and critically examine the situation. You may agree or disagree with the literature, you can raise further questions or pose concerns. Finally, you should formulate take home messages and areas for self-improvement and learning. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of artificial intelligence (AI):</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

You may choose one of the four topics suggested below or you can choose your own topic. If you choose your own topic, you have to send a 200 word essay plan to the course co-ordinator and obtain their approval before you can start on your topic.</p>\n<p>The paper must be based on current and relevant scholarly literature, include a clear hypothesis or research problem and present a balanced argument. This means that you are required to read and reference literature which supports and literature which criticises your hypothesis. You are also required to reference any thought which is not your own or is considered general knowledge. Research essays should be structured with an introduction, body and conclusion.</p>\n<p>Research essay topics:</p>\n<p>1. In the context of international conflict resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, problem-solving workshops, democratic dialogue and restorative practice/justice are often used synonymously. Discuss different definitions and understandings of these processes and develop a typology of cases which favour a particular approach. What are the similarities and differences between these different processes.</p>\n<p>2. What is the best way to mediate social conflict - in person, online (video or voice conference) or through other technologies? Discuss pros and cons of using different communication methods to conduct mediation processes. Also reflect on the opportunities and dangers of using Artificial Intelligence to conduct or enhance conflict resolution processes.</p>\n<p>3. Compare facilitative and evaluative mediation. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches when integrated into an adversarial justice system?</p>\n<p>4. Compare the cultural underpinnings of the facilitative mediation model to one other customary or cultural approach to conflict resolution/mediation. What are the similarities and differences? You can choose the customary or cultural approach, however, you must provide appropriate and accessible literature references for your arguments.</p>\n<p>5. Choose your own topic (you have to get approval from the course co-ordinator).</p>\n<p>For further information on writing research essays and referencing please refer to the POLSIS Essay Guide. You should read the assignment marking criteria for the research essay before you start writing. Please copy and paste the marking criteria on the last page of your assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria for acceptance and marking:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The research essay must be written in a coherent fashion and within the word length specified.

You do not submit a hardcopy of the assignment.</li>\n<li>The Turnitin settings allow you to submit your assignment before the deadline and then to check your Turnitin report. You can then upload a new assignment which will overwrite the previous submission. The final version of your assignment will be used for assessment. Please note that this function is only available until the submission deadline.</li>\n<li>Your assignment will be checked for signs of plagiarism by the Turnitin system and you will be able to view the Turnitin report.</li>\n<li>Your assignment will be marked using Turnitin and you will be able to view the comments, feedback and mark on the Blackboard website when they are released. <strong>It is essential that you copy and paste the marking criteria sheet on the last page of your assignment.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of artificial intelligence (AI):</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
