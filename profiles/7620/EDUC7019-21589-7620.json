Given what you have learnt in this course and building from the Reflective Learning Journals, create a lesson plan or a series of lessons in a curriculum area of your choice at primary or secondary levels, or for tertiary education. To optimise students’ learning, your lesson design, teaching and assessment strategies need to be responsive to four aspects of cognitive challenges or difficulties that students with learning difficulties/learning disabilities often encounter, choosing from what has been addressed in the course such as attention, working memory, remembering, knowledge building, problem-solving, metacognition.</p>\n<p><strong>In this task, you will need to include the following: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: Written Component (60%): </strong></p>\n<p>●     <strong>A lesson plan or a series of lessons (700 words):</strong> Explain the context of the lesson plan including the teaching subject, topic, a firm learning goal(s), year level, positioned phase of the lesson, prior learning, and the four chosen aspects of cognitive difficulties to be focused on. This is to provide a background for the lesson. Then clearly describe the lesson structure including a sequence of activities students will do, duration, resources and what support you will provide. You can use a table template for the lesson plan.</p>\n<p>●     <strong>Explanations and justifications of lesson design and strategies used (800 words): </strong></p>\n<p>-       Provide an overall statement of your lesson design and teaching approaches and what theoretical perspectives support your planning.</p>\n<p>-       Explain and justify why the specific design features, activities and/or strategies will be effective in supporting students with learning difficulties/learning disabilities in response to the 4 aspects of cognitive difficulties, based on evidence from recent relevant academic and/or research literature, including course reading.</p>\n<p>●     <strong>References </strong>(Included at the end, not counted in the word count)</p>\n<p>●     <strong>Word count and acknowledgement of use (or not use) of AI </strong>(Included on the first page, not counted in the word count)</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Interactive Oral Presentation in Class (40%, 7 min in total including 5 min presentation and 2 min Q&amp;A): </strong></p>\n<p>School teachers often work as a team in curriculum design in real-world contexts. You are invited to share your lesson plan with your colleagues. In the 5-minute presentation in the class, you will describe to your colleagues your lesson plan and justification for your lesson design, activities and strategies to mitigate the cognitive difficulties of students with learning difficulties/learning disabilities and support their learning. You will be expected to explain your lesson plan and the rationale for it based on the research, theory and content covered in the course and respond to the questions from the audience. The questions will be drawn upon the written component as well as presentation. Ensure you demonstrate a professional and collegial communication style, within the time limit. It is strongly suggested that you use visuals to support your communication, by considering the use of PowerPoint slides (no more than 4 slides) or a small, printed handout (no more than 200 words) e.g. a summary of key points discussed, a table of the lesson structure for colleagues. </p>\n<p>See the detail of Task Description, Guidelines and Marking Criteria on the course Blackboard.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
