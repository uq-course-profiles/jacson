A key focus will be on how tourism affects and involves different stakeholders in developing countries.</p>\n<p>This assessment requires you to submit three short in-class Communication Pieces during the first three to four weeks of the course.

            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>This course seeks to expose students to a variety of issues and challenges that developing countries face in the development and management of their tourism sector. Through the course, and this assessment item in particular, students will be encouraged to critically consider why tourism as a development strategy is not always as effective as it could be.</p>\n<p>This assessment task requires students to <strong>research, and write a blog about a tourism-related issue for a developing country </strong>(or region of a developing country - city, state, or province) of their choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, identify <strong>ONE example</strong> from a developing country where tourism, for whatever reason, has negatively impacted the region either economically, socially, environmentally or politically etc. (<strong>for example, there may have been limited economic impacts due to high foreign ownership</strong>) or the tourism sector is constrained by a range of external factors (for example, governance arrangements of the country do not allow for local engagement in the tourism sector). Focus on only <strong>ONE issue</strong> (e.g., economic issue) not multiple. Examples will be discussed in class, and students are encouraged to discuss their selected topic with the teaching team.</li>\n<li>Secondly, comprehensively research the issue and use a wide range of academic, government, and other online sources (i.e., blogs, news articles, etc.). Research should cover the context/background, the problem/issue, the impact on the country/region, etc. See Blackboard for further information on the types of things that might form part of your research.</li>\n<li>Finally, write an informative and educational yet highly engaging blog to bring awareness to your selected issue. The aim is to engage and excite readers about the issue. Once your blog is submitted and marked, you may like to post it online and encourage friends and family to comment on the issues raised in your blog post.</li>\n<li>The blog should be a maximum of 700 words and no less than 500 words.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be assessed on your ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide a well-researched and critical analysis of your selected issue; and</li>\n<li>write in a style that engages your audience (remember this is social media and not an essay), and draws attention to the issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other points to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The blog should be submitted through the Turnitin links on Blackboard. You will need to save your blog as a PDF for submission.</li>\n<li>At least 3 academic sources should be cited. Although this is not an academic piece of writing, the purpose of reviewing academic literature is to ensure the blog is underpinned by research. There are no limits on the number of other sources consulted, although you should note the requirements in the marking rubric on embedding relevant research, etc.</li>\n<li>See Blackboard for the marking rubric for this task.</li>\n<li>The word limit for this piece is relatively low; however, do keep in mind that this can in fact be more challenging than writing a several-thousand-word essay. Being able to convey information and provide a critical review (i.e. different points of view of an issue) in a concise and engaging style will require devoting considerable time and effort to this task.</li>\n<li>Pictures or other materials can be used as appropriate to engage your audience. There are no minimum expectations or requirements for the inclusion of other materials. The sources of all materials must be cited/referenced as appropriate. Be sure to check that there are no copyright restrictions on materials and photos that you have taken from the web.</li>\n<li>Blog examples will be posted on the course Blackboard site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
