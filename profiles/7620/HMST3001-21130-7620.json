This self-assessment supports your development as a reflective practitioner, a key capability embedded within the ESSA Professional Practice Standards. You will assess yourself against the ESSA Professional Standards based on your experiences from the first half of your placement.</p>\n<p>This self-assessment must be completed immediately prior to your supervisor completing the Intermediate Professional Attributes Assessment, ensuring that both you and your supervisor review your perceived performance at the same point in the placement and use this as a basis for discussion of strengths, progress, and areas for development.</p>\n<p>This task is assessed by the University on a Pass/Fail basis. A Pass is awarded when the student meaningfully engages with the tool by providing accurate self-ratings and thoughtful, reflective commentary for each standard. A Fail is awarded when the submission is incomplete, superficial, or does not demonstrate genuine self-evaluation against the professional attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>Intermediate Supervisor Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>As student practitioners on practicum, you are required to receive structured feedback on your developing professional capabilities. At the mid-point of your placement, your supervisor will assess your performance against the ESSA Professional Standards and provide ratings and commentary based on your progress to date.</p>\n<p>This assessment mirrors the structure of your self-assessment but is completed by your supervisor, who will rate your performance using the same four-point scale. The purpose of this assessment is to support your development as a reflective practitioner, guide professional growth, and identify strengths and areas requiring further improvement during the remainder of your placement. </p>\n<p>The supervisor’s ratings do not contribute directly to your course grade; however, receiving a rating of \"Development Required\" or \"Does Not Meet Expectations\" in any Standards requires the student and supervisor to work together to develop a plan to support progress and ensure the student can meet expectations by the end of the placement. </p>\n<p><strong>Final Supervisor Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>As student practitioners on practicum, you are required to demonstrate competency across the ESSA Professional Standards by the completion of your placement. At the end of your placement, your supervisor will conduct a Final Professional Attributes Assessment to evaluate your overall performance and readiness for professional practice.</p>\n<p>This final assessment provides an opportunity for you and your supervisor to review your performance, acknowledge strengths, identify any remaining areas for development, and confirm that you have met the minimum professional competency required for successful course completion.</p>\n<p>The assessment must be completed on your final day of placement or within five (5) days of finishing, ensuring your supervisor evaluates your most recent and complete performance across the placement. Unlike the mid-placement assessment, the final supervisor assessment is summative and contributes to your overall course result. To pass the placement, you must meet or exceed expectations in all Standards.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
