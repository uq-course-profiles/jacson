There are lots of ways to come up with an appropriate question. For example:</p>\n<p>·        Do some basic research to identify trending topics in education or psychology.</p>\n<p>·        Reflect on your own high school journey. What challenges did your parents have about your behaviour or development?</p>\n<p>·        Reflect of what your concerns might be if you were a parent of an adolescent today e.g., stress management, academic pressure, social dynamics, technology use.</p>\n<p>·        Talk to a person who has regular contact with a child or adolescent (e.g., teacher, parent).</p>\n<p>Your task is to design and prepare a poster which is suitable to be displayed at a ‘Parents’ Orientation Night’, therefore your audience are parents whose child (aged approx. 12-13 years) is commencing high school. Your poster must be written in non-technical (i.e., lay-person) language.</p>\n<p>The list of potential questions is endless, but here are some examples:</p>\n<p>•     How can I encourage open communication with my child while respecting their independence?</p>\n<p>•     How can I help my child find a healthy balance of screen time for schoolwork, social media, and fun?</p>\n<p>•     How can I encourage my child to develop good time management and study habits?</p>\n<p>•     What strategies can I use to ensure my child gets enough quality sleep in their teenage years?</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>The aim of the assignment is to:</strong></p>\n<p>•     Identify an appropriate question (just one question) for parents of children commencing high school.</p>\n<p>•     Design a poster which is interesting, informative, easy-to-read and has visual impact.</p>\n<p>•     Prepare a poster which contains information to answer the question, provides implications for parents, and includes references and resources to help a parent navigate the sometimes- difficult period of adolescence. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your poster must:</strong></p>\n<p>•     Make a professional (and aesthetic) impression</p>\n<p>•     Be prepared in PowerPoint A0 size</p>\n<p>•     Have a clear heading which identifies the question your poster is addressing</p>\n<p>•     Be divided into clearly recognisable segments or subheadings</p>\n<p>•     Contain body text which is written in non-technical (i.e., lay-person) language</p>\n<p>•     Contain neatly arranged graphic elements and an appropriate colour scheme</p>\n<p>•     Provide sufficient and scientifically sound information to answer the question</p>\n<p>•     Contain references and resources for further reading </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
