In order to guide practitioners in working with that issue, the director has tasked you with researching <em>how two different theoretical approaches conceptualise and work with this issue</em>.</p>\n<p>As a result of your research, you are to write a position paper. The director has made it clear that they want this paper to thoroughly address both the <strong>science</strong> and the <strong>art</strong> of each theory, and to make recommendations for practice. It is expected that submissions are of a high academic quality, i.e. your position must be supported by logical reasoning, coherent arguments, and with claims are backed up by literature (both theoretical and empirical).</p>\n<p><strong>Task</strong></p>\n<p>As a basis for the position paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose <em>one</em> of the following issues: (1) Depression; (2) Anxiety; (3) Grief and loss; (4) Addiction; (5) Low self-esteem.</li>\n<li>Choose any <em>two</em> theories you have studied in this course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The position paper must include the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A section on <em>each</em> theory covering: (a) An overview of the theory introducing its essential ideas; (b) An outline of how the theory conceptualises the issue from its theoretical standpoint (c) A summary of the evidence for its claims and its therapeutic approach; and (d) The theory’s approach to the art of practice in therapy with this issue.</li>\n<li>A critical comparison of the two theories’ science and art of approaching the issue. This section must discuss what is meant by both science and art in therapy, and outline each theory’s relative strengths and limitations in relation to science/art.  </li>\n<li>Drawing on the material outlined in the previous sections, present 3-5 recommendations for practitioners on how to conceptualise and practice therapy relating to this issue. These recommendations should link to the rest of the essay and be thoroughly justified with reasoning and evidence (i.e. supporting literature). </li>\n</ol>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
