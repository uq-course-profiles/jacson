Group members are first required to identify a historical period / time of interest (pre-20th century). Next, groups members should collaborate to compile a critical literature review on the time / place they have selected. After completing the reading, each group member will select one case study of interest from the reading, and conduct in-depth research about its <em>history</em>, <em>social context</em>, <em>meaning</em>, <em>form</em>, <em>function</em>, and <em>scale</em>. The case study will then be applied (compared) to contemporary cities.</p>\n<p>Presentations will take place in class throughout the semester. A detailed description of this assessment will be posted on the Blackboard. Groups present together each week, starting in Week 4. Since case studies will be individual, group members should take turns presenting. One member should be elected to present the theoretical portion, based on the reading. The presentation schedule will be posted on the Blackboard. </p>\n<p>Each group presentation will be assessed by the course demonstrator(s) and the peer panel to form a baseline marking.</p>\n<p>Paper submissions - one group member submits in Turnitin on behalf of the group and is then responsible for sharing the feedback with the group members. Presentation and paper marks will vary by individual performance(s).</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact the Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
            "submission_guidelines": "<p>The School of Architecture, Design and Planning uses Blackboard and Turnitin for assessment submission. Turnitin is accessed through the course Blackboard site. Turnitin also checks for plagiarism or instances where the original work of others is not appropriately acknowledged. Uploaded files must contain readable text and not be rasterised. Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission. To meet professional accreditation, public engagement and quality assurance obligations, digital copies of all course assessment items must be submitted in addition to any hard copy submission requirements specified in individual Course / Studio Outlines. Any physical models should be photographed and a minimum of two photographs describing the complete and full model must be included in the digital submission. </p>",
