Each quiz attempt is time-limited to one hour.</p>\n<p>There is also a practice quiz each week, which can be attempted any number of times.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The intention of this task is to allow students to practice solving problems related to key concepts in the course.
