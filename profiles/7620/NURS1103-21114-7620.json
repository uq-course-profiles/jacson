Demonstrated capability in clinical practice commensurate with the NURS1103 Course Learning Objectives evidenced by successful completion and submission of the Formative and Summative assessment items need to be completed with successful Summative Australian Nursing Standards Assessment Tool (ANSAT).</p>\n<p><strong>Part A: Formative Assessment </strong></p>\n<p>1. Placement Readiness Plan</p>\n<p>Within the first 2 days of clinical placement, you will develop a Placement Readiness Plan. The overall aim of the plan is to support you to develop agency in your learning and consider how to integrate learning and feedback between different contexts.</p>\n<p>2. Clinical Skills Assessment</p>\n<p>Within the first half of your clinical placement (prior to your Formative ANSAT) you will select one clinical skill to demonstrate to your Buddy RN or Clinical Facilitator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One (1) from the foundational clinical skills list,</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>3. ANSAT Self-Evaluation</p>\n<p>Immediately prior to undertaking your Formative ANSAT you will self-evaluate your performance against the NMBA Registered Nurse Standards for Practice. The aim of this task is to support your ability to evaluate your own performance through making comparisons of your work to that of your peers, supervisors and to the descriptions in the rubric.</p>\n<p>4. Formative ANSAT</p>\n<p>Must be completed and submitted via ePAD at the mid-point of placement (after approx.40 hours of placement):</p>\n<p>•\tMust be signed by Buddy RN/Preceptor or PPE/Clinical Supervisor.</p>\n<p>•\tAll sections must be completed (scores and comments).</p>\n<p>•\tStudents must receive a score of 3 or above on every criterion to meet the expected level of performance.</p>\n<p>Please note: Submitting the Formative ANSAT mid-placement will that ensure students who have not yet met the expected level of performance (scores of 3 and above) can be assisted with a Learning Support Plan through to the end of placement. </p>\n<p>5. Feedback and Action Plan</p>\n<p>Immediately following your Formative ANSAT you will reflect on the feedback you have received and identify areas for improvement (completed via ePAD). The purpose of this task is to assess your capacity for self-reflection and ability to process feedback from various sources, to deeply engage with your level of knowledge and professional skills.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part B - Summative Assessment</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Summative ANSAT</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Must be completed on your last or second-to-last shift and submitted via ePAD by the end of placement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be signed by Buddy RN/Preceptor or PPE/Clinical Supervisor.</li>\n<li>All sections must be completed (scores and comments).</li>\n<li><em>Students must receive a score of 3 or above on every criterion to pass. </em>(Any scores of 2 or below at this final assessment means that a student has not achieved passing requirements for this course).</li>\n<li>The completed timesheet must demonstrate all required hours of clinical placement for this course (80 hours), undertaken within the rostered timeframe as advised by the Clinical Placement Unit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students are to refer to the assessment task sheet located on the NURS1103 Blackboard site for additional details.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
