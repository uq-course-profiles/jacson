Typically guest speakers will be invited to give formal speeches for students to practice consecutive or simultaneous interpreting between English and LOTE (Chinese/Japanese). In the first half of the 3-hour class, students will practice consecutive and simultaneous interpreting. In the second half of the 3-hour class, they will be guided by the lecturer to engage in self-assessment and/or peer assessment using the assessment criteria and marking rubric for this course and using ELAN (a free software that can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download\">https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download</a>) as a tool for annotating the positive and negative aspects of interpreting performance. <strong>Students are required to conduct in-depth self-assessment of their interpreting performance for 3 out of the 6 in-class interpreting sessions.</strong></p>\n<p>Based on their self-assessment each time, they will be required to write a short self-assessment report (<strong>approximately 800 words</strong>) that includes (1) brief and objective overall assessment of their interpreting performance (especially accuracy, target language proficiency and delivery), (2) in-depth analysis of approximately 4 representative examples from their interpretations (e.g., good interpretations showing use of interpreting strategies and conscious decision-making and major or minor interpretation errors indicating room for improvement) and (3) a small, concrete and achievable goal for that week to improve one particular aspect of interpreting performance. No references are needed for the self-assessment report. Templates and examples will be provided to students in week 1 to facilitate their self-assessment.</p>\n<p>Students' self-assessment report will be assessed according to a marking rubric for this assessment item in this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI and MT Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (Al) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted in the spoken language interpreting venue. Any attempted use of Al or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>You may however find it useful to use these tools to plan and practice for your spoken language interpreting tasks, for example, looking up vocabulary, checking pronunciation, generating possible topics which you might encounter.
