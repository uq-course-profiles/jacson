In preparation for the forthcoming UN assembly on ‘Demographic Challenges and Solutions in the 21st century’, you have been tasked to establish the demographic profile of a country using the socio-demographic data from workshops 2 to 9. Drawing on a wide array of demographic measures and theories introduced in the lectures and readings, you are expected to establish demographic characteristics and challenges of this country and compare them to relevant countries or regions.</p>\n<p>Students should select a country of their choice on a first-come, first-served basis by filling out an online form that will be made available in Week 2. To avoid repetition, each country can be selected by only one student per group. Students are encouraged to discuss their choice with their tutor or course co-coordinator to ensure that their case study is relevant, and that sufficient data is available.</p>\n<p>Your work should be submitted as a one-page pdf poster. You are expected to selectively create your own graphs and tables to support your argument. Your poster should include a title, student name, student number and course code. Section titles for the introduction, conclusion, and relevant result sections are expected.</p>\n<p>Students will have 3 minutes to present their poster in Week 10 and 11 workshops and should be prepared to ask and answer questions.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
