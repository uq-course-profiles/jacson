Group sign-on will be done through Blackboard AFTER the census date to minimise potential disruptions to groups.</p>\n<p>Initially, students will be given the opportunity to form their own group, so coordinate the sign-on with potential team members. If you are forming a team, it is</p>\n<p>important that all intended team members sign-up at the same time as open team slots could be filled by others. We will not remove individuals once they have signed up to a team.</p>\n<p>(2) Group sign-on will commence on <strong>Monday Week 9 at 9AM</strong> and the sign-on link will be available until <strong>Thursday Week 9 at 3PM</strong>. Students that have not signed up to a team by 3 pm will be randomly allocated to groups with fewer than four members.</p>\n<p>To ensure that all members of group contribute equally to the project, we will use peer evaluation. More information on peer evaluation will be posted closer to the date. Results of peer evaluation could be used to adjust students score in extreme circumstances. One such example of an \"extreme circumstance\" is where a student has ignored all communication and has contributed nothing to the submitted assignment. In this case, the student will be awarded a score of zero.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</em></p>\n<p><em>A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<p><em>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
