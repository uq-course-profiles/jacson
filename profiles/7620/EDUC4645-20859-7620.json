In consultation with your lecturer and in response to feedback you have received from supervising teachers, identify an issue or question of relevance to you in your future practice as a teacher of music. Your topic should be linked to your own identified professional learning needs and should make a clear contribution to improving the impact you can make to student learning.</p>\n<p>For this assessment, you are to engage your peers in an investigation of your chosen issue through a ‘professional development’ seminar. Assist them to come to their own conclusions through participation in a thought-provoking workshop presented by you in a small discussion group (15-20 minutes). You may choose to frame your PD as a demonstration of ‘how to’ address a difficult issue specific to music education. Some examples of ‘issues’ include (but are not limited to): “How to incorporate Hip Hop Pedagogy in the Senior Classroom” or “How to integrate composition, performance and analysis in ways that enhance student motivation” or “how to design authentic, inquiry-driven performance assessments” or “how to assess compositions created in conjunction with AI”. It is strongly recommended that you check your topic or issue with your lecturer prior to the seminar date.</p>\n<p>Your workshop should be highly interactive, engaging your peers with your chosen topic, and should keep strictly to the time limit. You must incorporate an online resource created by you for your peers to ‘take home’ or refer to. The online learning resource should be able to be utilised by school students, in the style of a YouTube lesson, demonstrating your understanding of the issue. The online learning resource should also be able to be used by other teachers in their classrooms.</p>\n<p>Submission is to be through the discussion board on Blackboard, AND Turnitin and must include:</p>\n<p>Link to the online resource demonstrating application of theory to practice.</p>\n<p>One double-sided page of notes (referenced) summarising the key ideas in your PD, for use by your colleagues. Dot points or diagrams demonstrating synthesis of the ideas and their practical application are encouraged. The notes must demonstrate how the PD critically draws on a minimum of 10 recent (last 10 years) academic journal articles or book chapters, in addition to contemporary syllabus documents.</p>\n<p>Additional resources can be provided to colleagues, but are not required.</p>\n<p>Students are required to present their workshop live in class, and also video record their presentation, and upload it to Blackboard for a record of the presentation.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Each documented response will be marked as either a pass or fail, and will attract ½ percent weighting for the course. The final 400 word written reflection on learning summarises the student’s most significant learning over the year, detailing what has been learnt in relation to the learning outcomes of the course, referring to disciplinary developments in scholarship and professional practice, how students learn and the implications of this for planning for learning in music, intersections of theoretical notions of excellence in music education and curriculum requirements, how to design assessment, provide and respond to feedback.<strong> </strong>Conclude with a statement of intent regarding steps you will take towards becoming the teacher you wish to be, in your future practice (400 words).

(CC 2.2.2, 2.2.6 – taught). Mini-lecture 2 teaches about brain structure, function, and development, and how memory is processed, stored, and retrieved (CC 2.2.5 – taught).

Mini-lecture 5 teaches key features of coherent and deliberate planning (2.1.1 – taught), and how to sequence tasks in lessons (CC 2.1.3 – taught). Practical tasks following mini lectures As a tutor-led task following mini-lecture 1 , preservice teachers develop learning objectives for lesson sequences and task introductions with well-defined goals (CC 2.2.2 – practised). After mini-lecture 2 , preservice teachers engage in a recall task (CC 2.2.5 – practised). After mini-lecture 3 , preservice teachers incorporate spacing and retrieval practices into a lesson or sequence (CC 2.1.2 – practised). After mini-lecture 4 , preservice teachers observe tutor modelling of subject-specific worked examples, and design short tasks for students who are unfamiliar with a curriculum concept (CC 1.3.3, 2.2.4 – practiced).
