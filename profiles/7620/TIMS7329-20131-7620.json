However, as mentioned throughout the semester, students should still try to have some involvement in all core skills. Please submit your Table by the due date through turn-it-in Blackboard</p>\n<p>2.     <strong>Individual In-Person Interview (30%)</strong> – bring your submitted written Table to an Individual Interview with a member of the Teaching Team.
