Your posts can be very brief, i.e. ~100 words.

It is important that you post your reflections weekly as they will guide some of the class discussion during the workshops each week. It will also be very difficult to complete the final submission at the end of semester without having made posts weekly.</p>\n<p><strong>Part B - Final submission - summative feedback given through Turn It In - this is marked towards the final grade.</strong></p>\n<p>For your final submission, please cut and paste your <em>six </em>most significant reflections from those you have made each week into a word processing document (e.g. Microsoft Word). As a seventh and final section, please add either an introduction or conclusion reflecting on the semester as a whole (~200 words).
