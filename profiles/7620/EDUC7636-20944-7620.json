This preparation involves three parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A concise overview of a six-week teaching and learning sequence that prepares students to complete the assessment task.</li>\n<li>A lesson plan aligned with the year level and relevant sub-strand/s from the AC:E (version 9)</li>\n<li>A microteaching demonstration of a lesson segment (performed in small groups).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: Overview of a six-week teaching and learning sequence (individual written response) (800 – 1000 words)</strong></p>\n<p>The focus in AT1 is on creating tasks (as opposed to responding tasks). Choose one of the assignment task sheets provided on Blackboard (either a narrative or persuasive speech). Backward mapping from this task, plan a six-week teaching and learning sequence overview using the template and guided by the examples provided on Blackboard. This overview should be organised according to the five stages of the teaching and learning cycle and provide a concise overview of the teaching and learning strategies to be used in each stage of the cycle leading up to and preparing students for the assessment task you have selected. Clearly identify the lesson you are submitting as your detailed lesson plan (see Part 2, below).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Lesson plan (individual written response) (1200 – 1500 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Using the lesson plan template provided on Blackboard, develop a comprehensive 70-minute lesson plan from the Modelling / Deconstruction stage of your unit overview. Your lesson must be focused on one or a few related specific language features of either the narrative OR persuasive speech genre. Your goal is to support students to analyse the language feature/s so they can deploy the language feature/s in their summative assessment (Independent construction).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your lesson plan should deploy teaching and learning strategies that showcase your capacity to support student learning and be inclusive of diverse learners across a range of abilities.</li>\n<li>You should explain and justify your chosen teaching strategies and learning experiences, supported by appropriate scholarly and professional sources.</li>\n<li>Your lesson plan should incorporate appropriate resources, including ICT and a high-quality model text. If you cannot find an appropriate model text online, you can use AI to produce one. Note that you will need to ‘tweak’ what is produced to ensure it is fit for purpose. You also need to acknowledge any use of AI in relation to the model text (and/or any other aspect of your submission).</li>\n<li>You can also draw on other relevant resources, as appropriate. Include resources either as an appendix (acknowledging any sources as appropriate), or as hyperlinks within the lesson plan (or a combination of both). Appendixes are preferable to hyperlinks in the Turn It In platform.</li>\n<li>Use APA style referencing as appropriate e.g., for teaching strategies gleaned from books or journal articles.</li>\n<li>You must use the lesson plan template provided on Blackboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 3: Microteaching activity (group task, individual pass/fail grade)</strong></p>\n<p><em>N.B. This is a hurdle requirement – you cannot pass the assignment unless this activity is completed.</em></p>\n<p>Working in groups of two or three, present a segment from one of the lesson plans developed by one of your group members. You should collaboratively decide which segment to present. Your group members do not have to be backmapping to the same task for the written component.</p>\n<p>Your presentation must be a maximum of 15 minutes long and should consist of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a brief (two or three minute) overview which (i) outlines where and how your segment fits into the lesson and (ii) how the task/s in your segment tightly backmap to the summative assessment task</li>\n<li>delivery of a segment of the lesson (approximately 12 minutes).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>After your micro teaching activity has concluded, each group member will respond to questions without notice from the audience (your peers and tutor) for approximately five – ten minutes. </p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are not required to present the full lesson in the workshop – just a segment of the lesson</li>\n<li>All group members must contribute equally – both in terms of planning and organisation as well as to the presentation itself i.e., each person presents for the same amount of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A note about group work</strong></p>\n<p>All group members should contribute equally to the design and delivery of microteaching segment. However, the phenomenon of ‘social loafing’ is acknowledged as a frustration to some students. Social loafing is also known as ‘free-riding’ i.e., when one or more group members contributes little and ‘rides’ on the extra efforts of their co-workers (Walker &amp; Angelo, 1998).</p>\n<p>If your small group is experiencing dysfunction, including ‘social loafing’ by one or more members, it is your responsibility to bring this promptly to the attention of your tutor/course coordinator, who will then support the group to resolve the problems in a respectful way. If no resolution can be found, the tutor/course coordinator can remove the non-contributing student/s from the group and require student/s to complete the task either individually or in another small group with other ‘social loafers’.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Framed by the relevant syllabus and developed to meet the unique context of a school and student cohort, these documents provide a common direction and purpose for a school’s subject teachers and students. For example, using the unit specifications and requirements of the <em>English General Senior Syllabus</em> (2025), a school may plan TLPs for Semester 1 and Semester 2 of Year 11, by backward-mapping to their school-designed assessment instruments and the syllabus text requirements for <em>Unit 1: Perspectives and texts</em> and <em>Unit 2: Texts and Culture</em>. These TLPs would use texts, resources, and teaching and learning experiences that cater to the needs and interests of the school’s Year 11 students in subject English. For AT2, you will develop a teaching and learning sequence for a Year 11 English class, using an assessment instrument and a TLP scaffold, as provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description of task</strong></p>\n<p>Using the Unit 1 or<strong> </strong>Unit 2 assessment instrument and Teaching and Learning Plan (TLP) scaffold, develop an eight-week teaching and learning sequence that you and fellow Senior English teachers could implement.</p>\n<p>Your teaching and learning sequence needs to:</p>\n<p>1.     tightly backward-map to the assessment instrument you select from Blackboard. Both assessment instruments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>focus on responding to texts (as opposed to creating texts) in Year 11</li>\n<li>require study of a novel or collection of short stories that have been sourced from the <em>English/EAL General senior syllabus prescribed text list </em>(2026-2029)</li>\n<li>require students to submit/complete their assessment responses by Week 9 of your teaching and learning sequence</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.     use the TLP scaffold on Blackboard to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop a teaching and learning sequence comprising 24 lessons (3 x 70 minute lessons per week)</li>\n<li>include a description of the social context of your own mixed ability Year 11 English class, including their strengths and needs, based on existing assessment information and your own observations. You might draw on a real class you have taught on practicum or describe a fictitious but authentic-sounding class (150-200 words).</li>\n<li>provide a rationale that describes and justifies the value of your chosen focus for students at this point in their English studies. To justify your focus, you should draw on the relevant unit learning objectives and subject matter, as well as your understanding of relevant learner characteristics (150-200 words)</li>\n<li>ensure that all parts of your submission are uploaded to TurnitIn as ONE file only (your completed TLP).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.     <strong>For the first five weeks (Lessons 1 to 15)</strong>, provide an explicit teaching and learning sequence for Stages 1 and 2 of the teaching and learning cycle (Building knowledge of the field and Supported reading of the focus text/s).</p>\n<p>4.     <strong>For the final three weeks (Lessons 16 to 24)</strong>, provide a more succinct overview of how you will support learning in the final three stages of the teaching and learning cycle (Modelling/Deconstruction, Joint Construction, and Independent Construction).</p>\n<p>5.     Reference all text-based sources using APA style (e.g., to reference the novel or collection of short stories for study, other texts or sections of texts for use). Online sources can be acknowledged either by creating a hyperlink to that source or using APA conventions.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In completing this task, ensure that your teaching and learning sequence includes experiences that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tightly backward-map to the task throughout the teaching and learning cycle</li>\n<li>provide evidence of relevant pedagogical models (e.g., gradual release of responsibility model)</li>\n<li>demonstrate knowledge of and skill in planning and sequencing content and tasks so that they become increasingly challenging and show evidence of spacing and retrieval practice (CC 2.1 – assessed)</li>\n<li>use ICTs to support and expand teaching and learning experiences</li>\n<li>demonstrate knowledge of and skill in explicit teaching, modelling and scaffolding practices that support how a student’s brain learns (CC 2.2 – assessed)</li>\n<li>provide specific opportunities to develop literacy and numeracy skills</li>\n<li>provide specific opportunities for diagnostic and formative assessment</li>\n<li>cater to the needs of diverse learners across the full range of abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>And, because TLPs are sizeable documents, do NOT prepare or approach this task by preparing individual lesson plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>include only enough information to allow another teacher to understand and implement the common goals and plans of your teaching and learning sequence</li>\n<li>view the model TLP on Blackboard as a guide to the amount of detail required in Weeks 1 to 5 (explicit sequence) and Weeks 6 to 8 (succinct overview)</li>\n<li>you may find it helpful to use the AT1 unit overview template as an ‘at a glance’ planning tool (but don’t include this in your TLP submission)</li>\n<li>briefly describe accompanying resources, provide them in appendixes or as hyperlinks, or snip and paste them into the TLP ‘Resources’ column, as appropriate. For example, if you are using a PowerPoint, you aren’t expected to develop accompanying slides, but you might state that you’ll display the learning goals using PowerPoint, or that you’ll display a selection of writing prompts. If you are adapting a retrieval chart from<em> The Beginning Teacher's Companion</em>, you could create this in Word and then, providing it is still legible, snip and paste this as a small jpg file in the Resources column. If you are using an online resource, you can include this as an appendix or a hyperlink (please note, appendixes are preferable to hyperlinks in Turn-It-In).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Peer collaboration</strong></p>\n<p>Teachers often work collaboratively to develop Teaching and Learning Plans (TLPs), and you may find it valuable to engage in professional conversations with peers in this course. While this assessment is individually graded, in preparing your own TLP, you are encouraged to share ideas and discuss approaches in pairs or small groups with those who have selected the same task and/or text.</p>\n<p>If you participate in such collaborative discussions, you must include a brief acknowledgment in your submission. This should outline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The names of the peers you collaborated with</li>\n<li>The nature of the collaboration (e.g., discussion of pedagogical strategies, sharing of resources, etc.)</li>\n<li>A statement confirming that the final submission is your own individual work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This practice reflects professional norms and supports academic integrity.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Extension requests</strong> must be made using the official online procedures before the due date.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>APST: 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3</p>\n<p>Core content learning outcomes assessed: 2.1 Knowledge of and skill in planning and sequencing content and tasks so that they become increasingly challenging and incorporate spacing and retrieval practice; 2.2 Knowledge of and skill in explicit teaching, modelling, and scaffolding practices that support how a student's brain learns. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
