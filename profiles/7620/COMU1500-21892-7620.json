Journal entries can only be completed in class. Each week's journal entry is worth 6 points. Your final mark will be calculated from your highest 5 results across 8 weeks (5 weeks x 6 points = 30 points).</p>\n<p>Each weekly learning journal entry will comprise two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>1.    Questions on lectures and readings (4 points)</strong></p>\n<p>Questions will vary and may include: short answer responses, multiple choice items, or tasks based on visual material shown in class. </p>\n<p><strong>2.    Evidence of class participation (2 points)</strong></p>\n<p>You will write one or two sentences. You should describe the <strong>type</strong> of contribution you made: e.g. asking a question, responding to discussion, offering feedback to peers, assisting a classmate with activities. You should also provide specific evidence of your contribution: eg, “I shared a TikTok about beauty filters to show how algorithms shape representation and gender”; “I was confused about the reading and asked a question about it in class.”</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI Policy</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
