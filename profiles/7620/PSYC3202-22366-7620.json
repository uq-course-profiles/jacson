Write a critical essay evaluating the organisational literature on a theory, intervention, or practical recommendation that is related to your chosen topic (i.e. stress or motivation). Think of this essay as an appendix to the applied report, which provides the evidence-base for the main recommendation/s made in your applied report. If a keen human resources professional or manager/supervisor wanted to read more about the science underlying your recommendations, what might they need to know?
