Your cultural group can be defined at a national level (e.g., Korean, Australian, or German) or at a subculture level (e.g., religious groups). In your reflective essay, you should first state your cultural identification, position yourself as a member of the cultural group you identify with, be it national or a subcultural group. Then you explain how your cultural identification conveys a sense of identity to you; what beliefs, values, practices, traditions and so forth are considered important and why they are important to you and your cultural group. You may include examples of products or practices of your culture but your reflective essay should go beyond simply introducing or describing what the cultural products (e.g., a type of traditional food) or practices (e.g., eating certain traditional food on a special occasion) are. You should explain the cultural meanings of those products or practices and what they tell us about the cultural beliefs and values important to your cultural group and how those beliefs and values influence your thinking (attitude), doing (behaviour) and being (identity). Reflecting on your own culture will help you to appreciate differences as well as similarities between cultures, which prepares you for Assessment 3. You need to apply at least one theoretical concept or a theory learned in the course in relation to culture, identity, and communication. Define all theoretical concepts you choose to use in your reflective essay to demonstrate your knowledge of the concepts and your ability to apply them. You may cite academic and non-academic references for your reflective essay. Do not cite Wikipedia as academic references for your essay. Include all references cited within your essay in the references list at the end. <strong>APA 7th edition referencing style is required.</strong> The UQ Library website has APA 7th edition referencing style guide. The word limit (1500) for this assessment is suggestive. No penalties will apply based on the sole reason that your assessment is over/under the suggested word limit.

To accomplish this assessment task, you need to choose a culture or subculture other than your own, i.e. you are an \"outsider\" to this culture. You then need to search for academic and non-academic sources to learn about this culture and cultural group. Based on your research, you identify some aspects of the culture (e.g., certain cultural practices, traditions, values, beliefs, etc.) that you want to learn more about and provide a justification for why you choose to learn more about them. For the interaction part, locate about three persons from the cultural group you have chosen through personal, social, or academic networks (e.g., friends, colleagues, classmates, or professional associations of which you are a member, etc.). Interview them via a suitable medium (in person or online) to learn about their views regarding those aspects of the culture you are interested in learning more about. In other words, you learn about the culture you have chosen to study through interacting with people who are insiders of that culture. Provide your interview questions and summarise your main findings from interviews. Identify one or a set of potential intercultural problems that might arise in communication between members of the cultural group under study and members of your own culture (e.g., stereotypes, different beliefs and values, communication styles, etc.). Apply at least one theory to analyse the identified intercultural problem(s) and provide specific possible solutions, not just general statements.
