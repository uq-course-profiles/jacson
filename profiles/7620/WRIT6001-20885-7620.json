Students are advised to complete each module in sequence, during the corresponding teaching week (e.g. Module 1 in Week 1, Module 2 in Week 2). Each weekly online module may take <strong>between 1 and 2 hours to complete,</strong> depending on the content covered via different activity types, including problem questions (multiple choice, drop-down menus, checkboxes), video completion (entire videos must be watched), discussion forums (following all instructions), peer instruction questions (including minimum character requirements), drag-and-drop activities, and annotation tasks (see online modules for details).</p>\n<p>You can track your activity completion rate through the <strong>‘Progress’ tab</strong> in the Extend course (instructions will be provided online and during the Week 1 tutorial).</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You do not need to answer all activities correctly. You only need to complete them. Incorrect responses are acceptable, and you will have opportunities to revise your answers after receiving feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>PART 2: Extend Reflection</strong></p>\n<p>You must produce a Video Reflection explaining (1) how you drew upon the knowledge gained from the WRIT6001 course content to support your writing in the course assessments (e.g. the Comparative Article Review and/or the IMRD Paper) with detailed examples, and (2) how you will transfer and apply this knowledge to your writing in the future. This video reflection should be <strong>approximately 5 minutes long</strong>.</p>\n<p>The presentations will be recorded as <strong>a full video which shows your face in full screen</strong> (No PPTs are allowed).

These videos must be uploaded to Blackboard, and instructions will be provided in that folder and by your tutor prior to the deadline.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the START of the video, you must talk to the camera (i.e. NOT a photograph) and introduce yourself clearly showing your UQ ID card on FULL SCREEN.

If the marker cannot see your ID clearly, your video will be considered not submitted.</li>\n<li>Attach a <strong>screenshot of your Extend completion rate</strong> in Part 1 (i.e. at least 80% of Extend Participation) to the same submission folder.
