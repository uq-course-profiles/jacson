You will be provided with two short written texts produced by EFL learners from different first language backgrounds, reflecting on their experiences of studying abroad. The texts contain a range of linguistic errors (e.g. grammar and vocabulary) commonly found in second language learning.</p>\n<p>You are required to identify and analyse selected errors in the learner texts and explain the potential reasons for these errors drawing on CAH and EA (e.g. transfer errors or developmental errors). You will also be asked to propose pedagogical activities that address selected learner errors, demonstrating how theoretical insights can inform instructional practice. In addition, you will reflect on similarities between the observed learner errors and your own experiences of learning a second language and evaluate the usefulness of CAH and EA for learning and/or teaching contexts.</p>\n<p>This assessment evaluates your ability to apply SLA theory to authentic learner data and pedagogical situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI &amp; MT Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
