The session is designed to centre lived experience and professional perspectives, providing insight into how disability is experienced, supported, and understood in everyday life and clinical practice. By attending this activity, you will have the opportunity to listen to personal stories, learn about the roles of different health professionals, and reflect on how collaboration, communication, and respect underpin person‑centred care. This interactive panel-lecture also provides a safe and respectful space for you to ask questions and engage in meaningful dialogue with the panellists. Note*: Due to the nature of this activity and the availability of the panellists, it will be scheduled on a Tuesday, outside typical tutorial hours.",
