In this project, you will work remotely with a team to assess collaboration and communication tools and pitch a solution to management. Like any workplace collaboration, the project includes both individual and team writing, and you will be graded individually through a mix of self-, peer and instructor assessment.</p>\n<p>The project has four components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Annotated bibliography</strong> (10%, recommended deadline Monday week 12; team submission): you will assess 3-5 sources relating to remote collaboration and collaboration tools and write an annotated bibliography, which you will share with your team and submit as a group for assessment</li>\n<li><strong>Internal memo</strong> (10%, recommended deadline Monday week 13; individual submission): you will write a short email memo explaining which collaboration tool you recommend and why. You will share this with your team and submit it individually for assessment</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal</strong> (20%, deadline: 1st Monday of exam period; team submission): your team will write an internal proposal, based on your research and team memos, recommending a collaboration tool to management. Your team will submit this for assessment</li>\n<li><strong>Reflection</strong> (5%, deadline: 1st Monday of exam period; individual submission): you will write a reflection on your team's work throughout the project, including an assessment of your and your peers' contributions to the project</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadlines for this work</strong></p>\n<p>This project includes specific deadlines for each interim component of the project. These deadlines have been selected to ensure your team makes consistent progress towards the final submission while practicing key team writing skills.</p>\n<p>Should your team need an extension on any of the interim components (annotated bibliography, individual memo), you should agree on a new deadline together, and then email me to advise me of the date. All team members must agree to the new date, and all team members must be cc'd on the email requesting an extension.</p>\n<p>Should your team need an extension on the final proposal, you should agree on a new deadline together, and then submit a formal extension request to the central administration team.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
