Tutorials will be student-led and all students must participate in discussions in an informed manner. So this one is pretty simple. Marks are for active participation. That is, preparing, engaging intelligently and contributing ideas and information. Simply turning up is NOT participation; if you attend all tutorials but never speak, you will get zero. Marks will be awarded on a week-by-week basis. One mark is available for each of the tutorials.</p>\n<p>If you know you are going to have to miss a tutorial because of illness, family problems or some other reason you need to contact your course tutor <strong>prior </strong>to the tutorial. If you have missed a tutorial because of illness and were unable to contact your tutor in advance then you must do so as soon as is possible afterwards. Substitute work in the form of reading summaries can be accepted for a limited number of unavoidable tutorial absences. Email a member of the teaching team if you wish to discuss this. </p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.

Part B asks you to explain why this term is important (or not) when it comes to explaining politics and/or public policy. Examples will be provided in class and on blackboard. Part A is worth 1 mark and Part B is worth 2 mark.</p>\n<p>There are ten opportunities to take the quiz, but you only need to do it<strong> </strong>seven times, forming 21% of your grade.

If you do more than seven quizzes, you can seriously improve your grade as we will take your top results. Also note that the last quiz is held in Week 12 and plan accordingly!</p>\n<p>Each week I will run through the definition from the previous week and provide examples of what constituted excellent work.

In that test you will need to do all seven weeks’ worth of quizzes.</p>\n<p>As there is already flexibility built into this assessment to miss up to three quizzes, the make-up quiz does not apply to students who miss up to three lectures for illness, etc. The make-up quiz is <em>only </em>available to students who have a genuine, documented reason for missing a substantive part of the semester (more than three lectures). Reasons may include: long-term work commitments that cannot be altered; sudden/serious illness that requires a lengthy absence; or another documented reason for a lengthy absence.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

There are some big claims at the heart of governance theory: that politics has changed radically over the past few decades, that international and private sector bodies beyond our control now shape public policy, and that we cannot really hold anyone accountable for policy problems. Big bold claims but are they true? We will discuss these issues and then look at how governance perspectives can help us unravel and explain aspects of disaster management.
