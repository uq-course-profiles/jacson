The task is designed to deepen students’ understanding of ethical theory, professional values, and real-world decision-making processes, while also encouraging critical evaluation of the emerging role of AI in mental health practice. </p>\n<p><strong>PART 1: Ethical Framework Development</strong></p>\n<p>Students will conduct a literature review drawing on ethical theory, professional codes, regulatory expectations, and relevant mental health ethics literature. Using this evidence base, students will develop and justify a personalised ethical decision-making framework tailored to their professional identity and therapeutic context. The framework should be original, theoretically supported, and structured as a practical step-by-step model for guiding future ethical decisions in mental health practice.</p>\n<p><strong>PART 2: Applied Reflection &amp; AI Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Students will apply their ethical framework to a hypothetical ethical dilemma provided in the course and will input their framework into a generative AI tool to explore how AI interprets, applies, or distorts their model. Students will then critically analyse the strengths, limitations, and ethical risks associated with AI-mediated decision making, including potential issues around bias, confidentiality, professional judgement, clinical nuance, and client safety. Students will conclude this section with a reflective statement articulating their professional position on whether, when, and how AI could be ethically incorporated into mental health practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Appendix Requirement:</strong></p>\n<p>All AI prompts and AI-generated outputs must be submitted in an appendix. Students must clearly distinguish their own ideas, interpretation, and reasoning within the essay from any AI-generated material.
