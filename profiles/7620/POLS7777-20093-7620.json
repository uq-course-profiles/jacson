This story or event must be related to international politics, and should relate to the course topics, ideas, or themes. At the beginning of each seminar, students will have a 10 minute “news wrap” where they will discuss their news item in small groups. Each student will then be required to post a summary of their news story/event to the Padlet for that seminar with a critical reflection of that event: how can it be understood through the theories covered in the course, and what are the potential implications of that event? The corresponding Padlet link will <strong>only</strong> be made available during class. There is 1 mark available per seminar assessed (seminars 1-10), totalling 10 marks (10%)</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Two: Positionality Reflection (5%)</strong></p>\n<p>This task invites students to submit a 500 word self-reflexive discussion of their learning journey throughout the semester, their identity, values, assumptions, ethical stance/s, and their key takeaways as they think about what a career in International Politics “means” to them. 5 marks are available for this reflection. This reflection must be submitted via Turnitin by Friday 29 May. It will not be formally assessed and no feedback will be provided, but it will be checked to ensure you have completed the exercise and are eligible to receive these five additional marks. </p>\n<p>Sample questions to help guide your reflection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do I want to achieve in a career in international politics? What are my motivations, and why?</li>\n<li>What does it mean to translate theory into policy or practice? What is the relationship between these components of international politics?</li>\n<li>What does power and legitimacy mean to me in international politics?</li>\n<li>How does my own intersectional identity, personal experiences, and academic and professional background shape my engagement in international politics? How <em>should </em>these factors influence practice?</li>\n<li>What are the primary challenges or dilemmas that I anticipate I may encounter in a career in international politics?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
