This work must be completed in class.</p>\n<p><strong>The Management of Learning tasks reward active participation and regular engagement. We strongly recommend you attend all tutorials, because this is where you will learn core skills in literary studies, engage in rich conversations about books and ideas, and develop peer review skills. </strong>This assessment item is designed to reward preparation (reading the set texts, attending or listening to the lecture, and reviewing the reading guide before class). It will help students to summarise key analytical points and generate ideas for further discussion. This work is designed to give students a starting point that they can return to later, to practise key skills, and to provide opportunities to track their progress with generalised feedback.</p>\n<p>Students are required to participate for the full duration of the tutorial. By attending tutorials and actively engaging with the week's management of learning work, you can earn <strong>up to 20% (20 marks) towards your final grade. </strong>This provides your tutor with a chance to identify any challenges you may be experiencing with the learning materials and provide basic, regular feedback. A total of 8 points can be earned from <strong>participating in a tutorial and completing the week's reading log entry (1 mark per reading log). A total of 12 points can be earned on the knowledge quizzes in weeks 5 and 12: 6 points per quiz, and 2 points per question.</strong></p>\n<p>Your reading log entry should be 100-150 words (not including the question you are responding to) and take the form of a critical reflection on your reading of the week's texts. It needs no argument or formal structure, but <strong>must include at least one quotation from the text. </strong></p>\n<p>Your knowledge-quiz short answer responses should comprise 2-3 sentences in response to each question. There is no requirement that you include quotations in your knowledge quiz answers.</p>\n<p>This work is marked on a <strong>pass/fail</strong> basis per reading log/question. We will demonstrate how to submit these in our early lectures and tutorials.</p>\n<p>Complete your Reading Log assessment in class through Blackboard in the relevant weekly folder each week from Week 2 <strong>except Week 5, and 12</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The knowledge quizzes are your management of learning task in Week 5 &amp; 12</strong>. Students must attend the tutorial and answer three short questions each worth 2 points, provided in the tutorials in week 5 &amp;12. The questions in the <strong>knowledge quiz</strong> task will be on the literary terms and concepts and the texts set in the course. No extensions are possible except for UQ approved reasons. This learning activity ensures you are on track for your exam and research essay, and most students find this process an invaluable part of their learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking</strong>:  </p>\n<p>Reading log grades and feedback will consider textual analysis and writing skills. Knowledge quizzes will be marked on content awareness and knowledge. This assignment is marked on a pass/fail basis, and a more detailed rubric will be available on blackboard during the semester.  </p>\n<p><strong>Reading Log weeks:</strong> You must contact your tutor before your scheduled tutorial with the evidence required by UQ for an extension (e.g. a medical certificate). You and your tutor can negotiate an alternative arrangement for that week's Management of Learning task<strong>. Please do not submit a UQ Extension request.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge Quiz weeks:</strong> A total of four make-up sessions will be held across the semester for anyone unable to make their tutorial in week 5 or 12. Please email the course coordinator to indicate if you need to attend one of these sessions. Please note these make-up sessions are not intended for reading logs, but are for knowledge quizzes only in order to maintain the security of the quiz. </p>\n<p><strong>Use Of Generative AI or Machine Translation: </strong> </p>\n<p>Use of Generative AI: This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
