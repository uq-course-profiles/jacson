Students will describe how they have developed as a future speech pathologist and explain the development needs they have identified. Then, thinking forward to the remainder of their placement, students will identify skills, knowledge, and attributes they will continue to build, and outline how they will address their development needs and goals.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Part C: End-placement curation and video or written reflection (summative and required)</p>\n<p>Students will collect at least 3 different examples of professional practice and add these to the Portfolio. These can include:</p>\n<p>• De-identified session plans</p>\n<p>• De-identified client reports</p>\n<p>• Resources that you have developed</p>\n<p>• References relevant to placement</p>\n<p>Then, in a video or written submission, students will reflect on their placement experiences this semester and explain why they have selected these specific examples of their work and how they will use them in future practice (considering the transferability of these to different practice settings).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> A detailed task description outlining further directions and suggestions for how to structure the reflections, as well as marking rubrics, will be provided on the SPCH7111 blackboard site.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
