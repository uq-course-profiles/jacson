What was it about the penal colonies that made them places of opportunity for convicts, as well as places of punishment, at least until the 1820s?</li>\n<li>What philosophies, and what practical reasons, led to such negative perceptions of Indigenous Australians in the colonial period?</li>\n<li>Is the violence that developed between British colonists and Aboriginal people on the Australian colonial frontier best described as a case of ‘war’ or was it made up of a series of individual acts? What are the implications of each interpretation?</li>\n<li>Describe attitudes towards the Chinese on the gold fields in the 1850s. Why were the Chinese seen as such a threat?</li>\n<li>To what extent does the Anzac Legend simplify understandings of the Australian First World War soldiering experience? In your response you may like to consider the composition of the First AIF, the different battlefields on which Australians served, and soldiers’ varied reactions to war.</li>\n<li>What happened to the children, families and communities of the Stolen Generations? How was the removal of Aboriginal children from their families justified by the government and white society?</li>\n<li>Some historians have viewed WWII as a turning point for women in Australia, while others have seen it as having little long term impact. How did women's lives change in WWII, and were there any lasting impacts?</li>\n<li>In what ways did Australia use international diplomacy to try and improve its security in the decade after World War II?</li>\n<li>After the Second World War, the Australian government encouraged mass European immigration, reassuring current Australian residents that the newcomers would have to assimilate to the Australian way of life. What is assimilation and to what extent did this policy affect the lives of “New Australians”? </li>\n<li>How successful were the \"liberationist\" campaigns of the 1960s and early 1970s? Discuss with reference to one campaign (e.g. feminism, gay rights, sexual liberation, Black Power etc).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>If you use AI or MT to assist with this proposal, you must include a paragraph stating how you used it, whether you found it useful, and why or why not.
