Preface</strong></p>\n<p>In this assessment activity you are required to prepare a poster about your Industry Placement project. Subject to commercial confidentiality constraints, your poster may be displayed at next year’s ‘Industry Placement Poster Showcase Event’ convened by the school, that will be attended by incoming Industry Placement students, host organisations and employers (past, current and future), UQ staff and your peers. It is a good opportunity to showcase your work. In those sorts of forums and events, Posters are a useful way of communicating your work. Good posters strike an effective balance between attention-grabbing graphics and important detail to engage browsing attendees at the event.</p>\n<p> <strong>2. Poster Instructions, Format and Word Limits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each student is required to complete a ‘Poster’ as per the following instructions.</li>\n<li>This is an individual assessment. Students must submit their own work.</li>\n<li>Students should submit their poster in PowerPoint or PDF.</li>\n<li>Good quality posters do not just display thousands of words. They offer a concise summary, usually with some meaningful and compelling graphics, and work to attract and engage readers.</li>\n<li>There will be some examples of good posters from previous cohorts of the course available for your review on the course Blackboard site.</li>\n<li>Your poster should include:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The title of your project</li>\n<li>An introduction to your project highlighting why it is important</li>\n<li>A summary of your methods</li>\n<li>A summary of your results</li>\n<li>A summary of your recommendations and key findings</li>\n<li>Any relevant acknowledgements</li>\n<li>Your name</li>\n</ol>\n<p> <strong>3. Formatting and Referencing Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whilst there is no specific formatting requirement for the post (you choose what you think is best for your project to achieve the purpose of the activity) please note the following advice from the UQ Library about how to format a good Poster</li>\n<li>The poster should be on A1 paper</li>\n<li>Use a 3 or 4 <strong>column</strong> format</li>\n<li>Try to keep 40% of the poster as <strong>white space</strong>, with no text or images. It helps organise the flow of information and prevents cluttering</li>\n<li>Keep a margin around the edge of the poster</li>\n<li>Use a large <strong>heading</strong> for your title across the top and <strong>sub-headings</strong> on your columns</li>\n<li><strong>Text size</strong> recommendations</li>\n<li>Title heading 85 point font</li>\n<li>Subheadings 36 point</li>\n<li>Body text 24 point</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.clips.edu.au/posters/\">CLIPS website</a> has information on what to put in a <strong>science poster</strong></li>\n<li><strong>In </strong>PowerPoint <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-size-of-your-slides-040a811c-be43-40b9-8d04-0de5ed79987e\">Set the size of the slides</a> to the poster requirements before you start</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/save-powerpoint-presentations-as-pdf-files-9b5c786b-9c6e-4fe6-81f6-9372f77c47c8\">Convert your slide to a PDF</a> before you print it to keep the formatting as you intended.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/layout-and-composition-grids/designing-the-poster-grid?u=2340058&amp;auth=true\">Layout and Composition: Grids (LinkedIn Learning, 1h1m)</a> looks at how to use grids to create strong and consistent designs for posters.</li>\n<li>Don’t forget to include references and attributions.</li>\n<li>Try not to cut and paste illustrations from other sources. If possible, represent the illustration using your own interpretation - redraw it and modify it if needed to best illustrate your point, but be sure to cite the original source of the illustration.</li>\n<li>UQ plagiarism rules apply to this assignment.</li>\n<li>References should be cited and listed using Harvard style.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>No Poster submitted: </strong>In the event a submission is made but some parts of the Poster are not provided or are incomplete or are not addressed in sufficient detail, the Course Coordinator may request students to revise and resubmit their Poster until it achieves a Pass standard.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
