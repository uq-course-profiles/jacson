The chatbot must incorporate relevant technical documentation, operating procedures, safety protocols, and troubleshooting guides for distillation processes, using vector databases and embedding models to retrieve contextually relevant information before generating responses. Implement the RAG pipeline using appropriate frameworks and a suitable language model to ensure the chatbot can answer questions about the column, operating parameters, common failures, safety procedures.

Students are required to deliver a 15–20 minute in-person presentation that includes a live demonstration of their RAG chatbot. The presentation should clearly showcase the chatbot’s capabilities through real-time interactions, demonstrating how it assists operators with technical queries related to distillation column operations, troubleshooting, and safety management. It should also provide an overview of the system architecture, explain the RAG implementation, present model performance results, and discuss both limitations and potential industrial applications.</p>\n<p>Closed-book, no written materials or calculators are permitted.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
