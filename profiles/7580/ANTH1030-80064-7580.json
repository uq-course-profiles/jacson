Now think of that thing in a museum in the future, now existing without its story or its history -- an 'orphan thing' that has come to represent an aspect of your society in the early 21st century.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Note: this assessment is not the same assessment as you will encounter in World101X module 5. View that exercise as a practice round for this assessment, which has different requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An object: </strong>Choose ONE (1) object from your own home that is important to you in some way, and that shows its history, usage and/or significance in some way. Now imagine your object is in a museum 50 years in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Museum Label: </strong>Attach a label to your object, which will tell someone in 50 years about it, its importance to you, and to the society you live in. The label must be no longer than 50 words. Think critically about the object, its role, and significance, and boil this down to a concise and easy-to-understand label. What do you want to tell others and future generations about this object?</li>\n<li><strong>Reflection: </strong>In addition to this label, you will be required to<strong> </strong>reflect (in 500 words or less)<strong> </strong>by thinking critically about some of the issues raised during the course segment on museums. These reflections may be supported with relevant anthropological literature, either from the course readings or your own library research.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example questions you could consider writing about: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the broader political and social dynamics around your choice of the object displayed?</li>\n<li>How do you imagine they might be received, and how might they best be displayed to reveal your intention/s?</li>\n<li>What do you think are the dynamics at play when museums display objects from the past in general? </li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Submission:</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment should be submitted to Turnitin via Blackboard and should be structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Museum label (landscape, one page), consisting of a:</li>\n<li>Photograph of your object</li>\n<li>Title &amp; Label (50 words)</li>\n<li>Reflection (1–2 page, double-spaced, serif font); (500 words)</li>\n<li>Bibliography</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>If you have issues with submitting this item, please contact the Course Coordinator who will be available over the holiday period. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A note on ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI:</strong></p>\n<p>All assignments for this course are to be researched and written by you. You are to explore the literature, you are to think the ideas, you are to write the sentences, you are to build the argument. I recognise that ChatGPT can be used in a variety of ways in the course of learning about a new topic. Some students, for example, might use ChatGPT as a place to start to begin to learn about a new concept or topic. While this can be helpful, it can also produce results that are highly problematic. We will discuss some of these issues during the course. What I ask of you is this:</p>\n<p>1)    All written assignments are to be researched and written by you.</p>\n<p>2)    If you use ChatGPT as a source of initial inquiry, you:</p>\n<p>a) acknowledge this in your final work in a statement at the end (either before or after your bibliography),</p>\n<p>b) you divulge the questions you asked AI in the course of research, and</p>\n<p>c) you use the response you receive as a preliminary start only.</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you gather from AI is accurate and timely. Also acknowledge any use of any AI-assisted editing programs, such as Grammarly or translation tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.

This media project is about you choosing a topic and exploring it anthropologically.</p>\n<p>The project tests your ability to analyse and communicate about complex issues and your ability to think openly and critically, by asking you to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain the the case or event, highlighting its social/cultural dimensions;</li>\n<li>Explain and apply anthropological concepts — combining knowledge gained from the course and your own original research — to analyse the case study as an example of a 'current world issue';</li>\n<li>Evaluate your analysis, taking up an informed position and justifying this position.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>For the Summer Semester instance of this course, the media project will take the form of a video essay. A video essay brings together video, audio, visual materials, and text to present and analyse a topic (examples will be shared during the course). A video essay often has a similar structure to a written essay, but tends to be a bit more personal. You present an argument, and therefore, your own (anthropologically informed) opinion on the matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Step-by-Step Project Outline</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a current event</strong> or happening. This can be something you pick up in the international or local news; it can be something trending on TikTok; it can be a major issue in your own field of study (for example, engineering, waste management, or music); or it can be something you observe happening around you, like protests or developments. </li>\n<li><strong>Gather at least four</strong> (4)<strong> primary sources </strong>about the event or happening.</li>\n<li>These can be news clips, press releases, government reports, videos, photographs, or other information about this event/happening. Depending on your topic, more than four sources may be necessary to tell the whole story.</li>\n<li>All sources should be from reliable, trustworthy media sources (unless, perhaps, if you are writing on disinformation),</li>\n<li>Challenge yourself to engage with different perspectives. For example, sources coming with different political, cultural backgrounds, or different countries).</li>\n<li>After learning as much as you can about the event, consider: <strong>what might an anthropologist have to say about this topic</strong>? What is anthropological about this particular event or thing in the world? How might you explain this event to someone else by drawing on the perspectives/tools.concepts used in anthropology?</li>\n<li>Research and <strong>connect at least four</strong> (4)<strong> peer-reviewed anthropological secondary sources</strong>.</li>\n<li>These can be works we have discussed in class, sources you used for your essay, or new sources. You don't have to find anthropological work about the case study itself, but rather about the 'current world issue' (or concept) that it represents.</li>\n<li>Think about how the particular case might be informed by, or compare to, the theory or argument set forth in these anthropological sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Craft a video essay</strong> that brings in an anthropological perspective (5 to 6 minutes).</li>\n<li>Write a script</li>\n<li>Find any supplementary audiovisual materials (photographs, video/news clips, objects) that will feature in your video essay</li>\n<li>Record yourself presenting your video essay</li>\n<li>[Edit your video as necessary]</li>\n<li><strong>Upload your video to EchoVideo </strong>and collect the share link (instructions will be posted to Blackboard).</li>\n<li><strong>Write a short reflection (300 words) </strong>discussing how your news piece engages with anthropological concepts, theory, or perspectives (i.e., your four secondary sources). This reflection allows you to explain how these anthropological concepts, theories or perspectives have informed your news piece. It is both a tool for checking your own analysis and an opportunity to draw clear connections between primary and secondary sources.</li>\n<li>Your reflection should be <strong>submitted to Turnitin</strong> and structured as follows:</li>\n<li>Include your video link at the top of the document.</li>\n<li>At the bottom of your document, include a <strong>reference list</strong> of all cited primary (at least 4) and secondary (at least 4) anthropological sources. These should be under separate subheadings titled “primary sources” and “secondary sources.” The reference list is NOT part of your word count. Check the UQ Library guides for advice on formatting citations and references for a range of source types: <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing\">ALL GUIDES - Library Guides at University of Queensland Library</a>. We recommend using APA7 or Chicago 17, unless you are more familiar with another style.</li>\n<li>If using any AI, include a statement below the reference list (instructions below).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Additional requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment is designed to be an authentic assessment, written and produced by you. This means that you should act as the presenter of the video essay, meaning that you should recognisably be on video presenting the video essay (no (AI) avatar or (AI) third-party voiceover is allowed in this assessment. Communication and presentation skills are part of the grading criteria, so make sure to not just read out the script and to feature your own personality and perspective/opinion in the video essay.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>:</p>\n<p>If filming a video essay is not accessible to you, other media project formats can be considered. <strong>You will need to confirm your format with the course coordinator by emailing a short proposal before 9th January 2025. </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Submission:</strong></p>\n<p>What you will submit has three components:</p>\n<p>1) The video essay (uploaded to EchoVideo; the share link included in the Word document)</p>\n<p>2) a 300-word written reflection, and</p>\n<p>3) a properly formatted citation list with at least 8 sources (4 primary, 4 secondary) and (if applicable) AI statement.</p>\n<p>You will submit your Word document via Turnitin on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Even though your project can take different formats, you must demonstrate correct referencing and show that you have drawn upon at least 4 relevant peer reviewed sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>A note on ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI:</strong></p>\n<p>All assignments for this course are to be researched and written by you.
