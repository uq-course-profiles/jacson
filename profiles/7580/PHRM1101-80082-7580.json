However, one of the most essential skills for a pharmacist is the ability to translate technical, clinical and pharmaceutical information into language that is clear and meaningful for patients. This requires tailoring your message to suit your audience.</p>\n<p>In this video group assignment, you will demonstrate these communication skills. Local pharmacies and medical centres administering vaccines have requested your group to develop a <strong><em>short educational video</em></strong> and an <strong><em>accompanying information leaflet</em></strong> to encourage patients to get vaccinated this season.</p>\n<p><strong>General points:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assignment type: </strong>This is a group assignment. Every group member must appear and speak in the video.</li>\n<li><strong>Allocated vaccine:</strong> Each group will be assigned a specific vaccine for the assignment.</li>\n<li><strong>Video: </strong>Create a video no longer than three (3) minutes (do not speed up your videos), providing key information about the allocated vaccine.</li>\n<li><strong>Information leaflet:</strong> Prepare a concise, plain language written leaflet (1 single-sided A4 page, 1.25 cm margins and font size 11) to complement the video and further clarify information.</li>\n<li><strong>Referencing: </strong>Use <strong><em>APA 7th style</em></strong> referencing for both in-text citations and reference lists. References must appear on the final frame of the video and at the end of the leaflet. Use authoritative, verifiable sources (e.g., peer-reviewed literature, standard reference texts, regulatory/guideline documents).

These tools can assist with brainstorming, refining structure and language, and improving grammar and clarity in your video script or information leaflet. However, the communication content, scientific accuracy, and health messaging must reflect your own understanding and professional judgment as a pharmacy student.</li>\n<li><strong>AI acknowledgment:</strong> You must include an AI use acknowledgement statement beneath the assignment title in your submission and at the beginning or end of your video, clearly indicating whether AI tools were used. <strong><em>Example 1 (AI used): </em></strong><em>This assignment was developed with the assistance of AI tool(s) [name(s) of the AI tool(s)] used for idea generation and language editing. All final content, patient communication messages, and clinical information are our own. </em><strong><em>Example 2 (no AI used):</em></strong><em>This assignment was completed without the use of AI tools.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Record-keeping:</strong> If you use AI tools, you must be able to provide documentation on request demonstrating your process and contribution. Keep a record of all prompts entered, AI-generated outputs, and the tools used. You do not need to submit this record with your assignment, but you may be asked to provide it to verify your process.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrity requirements:</strong> Your use of AI must uphold UQ's Academic Integrity Policy and Student Code of Conduct. Failure to acknowledge AI use or overreliance on AI-generated material may constitute academic misconduct. Do not use AI to fabricate references or unverifiable claims, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of all content and citations.</li>\n<li><strong>Tip: </strong>Use AI as a learning aid, not a substitute for you clinical reasoning or communication skills.

This is called reflection, and it is a key skill for health professionals to evaluate and improve their knowledge and skills for the future.</p>\n<p>Following the release of your marks for the OSCE oral consultation, you will be required to submit a written reflection on your performance and identify areas for future improvement. The reflection will follow the 4Rs framework and will be assessed against the rubric available on the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment details</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type: </strong>This is an individual assessment. Your submission must represent your own experience, insights and analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>Framework: </strong>The reflection will follow the 4Rs framework (Report &amp; respond, Relate, Reason, and Reconstruction).</li>\n<li><strong>Depth and specificity:</strong> Use concrete examples from your OSCE to evidence claims. Avoid generic statements; focus on what you will change and how you will change it.</li>\n<li><strong>Professionalism and confidentiality:</strong> Maintain professional tone. Do not include identifying information about simulated patients, peers, or assessors.</li>\n<li><strong>Length: </strong>Unless otherwise stated on Blackboard, there is no set word limit. Aim for a concise, complete, and well-structured reflection that addresses each of the 4Rs.</li>\n<li><strong>Rubric:</strong> The rubric for this assessment is available on the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI): </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, Grammarly) may be used appropriately to support planning, language refinement, and grammar/clarity. However, the scientific content, analysis and interpretation must be your own.</li>\n<li><strong>AI acknowledgement: </strong>You must include an AI use acknowledgement statement at the start of your reflection, clearly indicating whether AI tools were used. <strong><em>Example 1 (AI used): </em></strong><em>This assignment was developed with the assistance of AI tool(s) [name(s) of the AI tools()] used for idea generation and language editing. All final content, patient communication messages, and clinical information are our own. </em><strong><em>Example 2 (no AI used): </em></strong><em>This assignment was completed without the use of AI tools.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Record-keeping:</strong> If you use AI tools, you must be able to provide documentation on request demonstrating your process and contribution. Keep a record of all prompts entered, AI-generated outputs, and the tools used. You do not need to submit this record with your assignment, but you may be asked to provide it to verify your process.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrity requirements: </strong>Your use of AI must uphold UQ's Academic Integrity Policy and Student Code of Conduct. Failure to acknowledge AI use or overreliance on AI-generated material may constitute academic misconduct. Do not use AI to fabricate references or unverifiable claims, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of all content and citations.</li>\n<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use AI as a learning aid, not a substitute for you clinical reasoning or communication skills. Think critically about how AI supports your understanding and helps you communicate effectively with patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
