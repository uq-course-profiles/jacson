Topics will be assigned by the course instructors. Video files of all podcasts will be made available for all tour participants to watch and you should be prepared to receive and answer follow-up questions from fellow students while in Italy.</p>\n<p>Although the precise content of each podcast will depend on the topic, typically your podcast should outline the history and significance of the site/monument/collection, identify some particularly significant features, and suggest how the site/monument/collection contributes to our understanding of ancient history. Your podcast should be based on scholarly works and official information (e.g. museum websites), and all resources used (including any AI tools) must be referenced in a written transcript and bibliography. Podcasts can be recorded using Zoom, Microsoft PowerPoint, or similar software. Further guidance will be provided in class and on Blackboard. (Please note: while you will not be assessed on technical aspects of video production, your words must be clearly audible and all images and text must be legible in the recording. You don’t need to appear in the podcast if you don’t want to.)</p>\n<p>You must submit your podcast as an MP4 file. You must also submit a written transcript, including references and bibliography, through Turnitin. Your references and bibliography must follow the style set out in the Classics and Ancient History Study Guide and Study Videos.</p>\n<p>Following our visit to the place in question, you will be required to submit <strong>a written reflection of 250 words</strong> (+/- 10%) commenting on how your experience of visiting the site/monument/collection in person compared with your expectations from preparing the podcast, including any additional insights you gained from visiting in person and anything in the podcast that you would have done differently in light of your in-person experience and questions from other students. Your written reflection must be submitted within three calendar days of visiting the site/museum.</p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
