Background</strong> (suggested two A4 pages)</p>\n<p>·        A discussion of the relevant legislation and policy documents and a teacher’s legal obligations, related to this scenario. (Choose a jurisdiction where you plan to teach). Legislative and academic references should be included. </p>\n<p>·        An indication of the assessment data (formative and summative) and school/classroom records you would study prior to the meeting to provide background on the student’s progress.

You may wish to consider engagement strategies, such as the use of two-way positive communication, collaborative planning and problem-solving, and how you will use light-touch learning updates (e.g., brief, regular updates), among other approaches.</p>\n<p>o  Information you will report to parents/carers that includes a description of the records you will keep of student learning and achievement together with an explanation of the purpose of keeping accurate and reliable records on student learning and achievement.</p>\n<p>o  Explanation of learning adjustments applicable to your teaching year level in response to the student’s IEP.</p>\n<p>o  Explanation of reasonable adjustments planned for assessment, in response to the student’s IEP.</p>\n<p>o   Explanation of your plan for the student’s wellbeing and safety, including positive behaviour support processes (Tier 1, 2 or 3, as applicable) and classroom environment considerations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3.      <strong>Follow up </strong>(suggested up to one A4 page)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>o  Keeping a record of the conversation.</p>\n<p>o  Further meetings.</p>\n<p>o  Reporting to others (e.g., school learning support team)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>[1] Individual Education Plan is internationally recognised terminology.
