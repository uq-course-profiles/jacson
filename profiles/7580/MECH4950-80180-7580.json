The report will combine personal reflections with an in-depth profile of one of the host companies visited—such as PT PINDAD, Heksa Hydro, PT LEN, or PT Len Railway Systems. The profile may include a historical perspective on the company’s development or a comparative analysis with a similar enterprise in Australia, highlighting differences in scale, strategy, or innovation.</p>\n<p>The report is expected to demonstrate critical engagement with both technical and cultural insights gained through the program. Specifically, students will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Evaluate the strengths of current approaches to advanced manufacturing in Indonesia and propose strategies for how these practices could inform or be transferred into an Australian context.</li>\n<li>Compare and contrast academic and professional engineering practices in Indonesia and Australia, identifying both shared principles and distinctive differences shaped by cultural, industrial, and educational contexts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please refer to Blackboard for detailed marking criteria.</p>\n<p>This reflective assessment will encourage students to integrate technical, professional, and intercultural perspectives, deepening their understanding of Indonesia’s role as a regional partner in advanced manufacturing.</p>\n<h3>Marking Rubric – NCP Indonesia Program Report (100%)</h3>\n<p>1.

Company Profile and Comparative Analysis (25%)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent (21–25): Offers a detailed, accurate profile of one company with strong historical or comparative analysis, effectively linking to an equivalent Australian context.</li>\n<li>Good (16–20): Provides a clear and relevant company profile with some comparative insights.</li>\n<li>Satisfactory (11–15): Profile is descriptive, with limited depth or weak comparative analysis.</li>\n<li>Poor (0–10): Incomplete, inaccurate, or lacks meaningful analysis of company operations or comparison.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. Evaluation of Indonesian Manufacturing Strengths and Application to Australia (25%)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent (21–25): Provides a rigorous evaluation of Indonesia’s manufacturing strengths with innovative, practical strategies for transfer to Australian contexts.</li>\n<li>Good (16–20): Identifies key strengths with some discussion of potential application to Australia.</li>\n<li>Satisfactory (11–15): Identifies some strengths but discussion of transferability is vague or limited.</li>\n<li>Poor (0–10): Minimal or superficial analysis; fails to link findings to Australian context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4. Comparison of Academic and Professional Engineering Practices (20%)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent (16–20): Insightful, evidence-based comparison highlighting both similarities and differences, with strong cultural and professional context.</li>\n<li>Good (11–15): Clear comparison with some cultural or professional insight.</li>\n<li>Satisfactory (6–10): Basic comparison, mostly descriptive with little depth.</li>\n<li>Poor (0–5): Incomplete or superficial comparison; lacks meaningful analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5. Structure, Presentation, and Academic Writing (10%)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent (9–10): Report is very well structured, concise, and clearly written; strong use of references, visuals, and professional formatting.</li>\n<li>Good (7–8): Generally well structured and clear, with minor lapses in clarity or formatting.</li>\n<li>Satisfactory (5–6): Adequate structure and readability; some issues with flow, referencing, or formatting.</li>\n<li>Poor (0–4): Poorly structured, unclear writing, missing references or weak formatting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
