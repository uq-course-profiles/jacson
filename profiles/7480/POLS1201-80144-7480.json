            "topic_description": "Week 4: International History in the Twentieth Century This lecture will introduce students to the Great War, the inter-war years and the Cold War by surveying the different accounts of their origins and ends. It will focus substantively on the Cold War, sometimes referred to as 'the long peace', which dominated twentieth century international relations. Although they were wartime allies, the USA and the USSR quickly became suspicious of each other after the Second World War s end -- much as they had been after the Russian Revolution of 1917. This lecture looks at how the USA and USSR viewed each other across most of the 20th century, what strategies they adopted in their superpower rivalry, and how the Cold War ended. It also considers the impact of nuclear weapons on the Cold War and international relations more generally.",
