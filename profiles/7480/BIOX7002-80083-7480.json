It will also act as a “milestone” for supervisors to enable them to judge your writing skills, and enable early intervention if necessary. You should develop the project plan through consultation with your supervisor. </p>\n<p><strong>Format of Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The plan should be prepared using a word processor. The page margins should be set to 2cm all round, the pages should be numbered and 12pt Calibri (or equivalent) or Times New Roman (or equivalent) fonts should be used. The first page of the plan (<em>not counted in the total number of pages</em>) should carry your project title, your name and student number, and your supervisor’s details. The maximum length of the plan should be a 2 page introduction plus a 1 page plan.</p>\n<p><strong>The first part of the project plan</strong> should be a thorough introduction to your area of research, which should be produced through careful consideration of the current scientific literature (and any company documentation where relevant) pertinent to the project. </p>\n<p><strong>The second part of the project plan</strong> should include a brief description of the main aim(s) of your research project, followed by a brief outline of the proposed research strategies that you will use to meet the aims of your project. <em>No more than one page should be used for this section.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
