Please ensure that your supervisor signs and dates each entry.

The student should decide on a scientific area that aligns with their Masters program and that interests them. Before the first week of semester the student should secure a supervisor. There are many avenues to identify a potential supervisor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>searching the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences website (<a href=\"https://scmb.uq.edu.au/\">scmb.uq.edu.au</a> )</li>\n<li>consult the SCMB Research Projects booklet (<a href=\"https://scmb.uq.edu.au/study/postgraduate-coursework\">scmb.uq.edu.au/study/postgraduate-coursework</a> )</li>\n<li>the web pages of the various research institutes at UQ, links to those web pages can be found here <a href=\"https://research.uq.edu.au/\">https://research.uq.edu.au/</a></li>\n<li>the UQ Researchers website (<a href=\"https://researchers.uq.edu.au/\">https://researchers.uq.edu.au/</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should contact prospective supervisors and ask whether they have time to supervise your literature review. Supervision will involve meeting with you <strong>at least 5 times</strong> during semester to discuss your progress and help you with any difficulties you have encountered. Your supervisor must sign the SUPERVISOR APPROVAL FORM. </p>\n<p>2. Once you have had an introductory meeting with your supervisor and established the topic of your literature review, you should begin looking for key papers. This will involve searching the various library databases (<em>e.g.</em> PubMed) for relevant papers. If you are not familiar with these databases, you should enrol in one of the short courses offered by the library. Please ask at the Information desk and indicate that you are a postgraduate student. Once a topic has been selected, the student will search the literature in that area, and select a recent research paper (within the last 2 years, NOT A REVIEW) which has significantly advanced our understanding of any key aspect of the topic. The chosen paper must represent a substantial piece of work with clearly-described (or well-referenced) experimental detail. It is intended that each student select a different research paper. The student will confirm the paper with their supervisor.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation of the Paper Critique</strong></p>\n<p>The Paper Critique will consist of the sections described below. The page limit is 15 pages (this does NOT include bibliography, figures and tables)<strong> <em>if this limit is exceeded penalties will be applied in marking.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The plan will be prepared using a word processor: page margins will be set to 2 cm all round, pages will be numbered, font of 12 pt Calibri or Times New Roman (or equivalent) is acceptable, line spacing of 1.5 will be used. The first page (not counted in the total number pages) should carry your title, course code your name and student number, and your supervisor’s details.</p>\n<p>The Paper Critique will consist of the sections described below. </p>\n<p><strong>(a) Abstract. </strong>Your review should start with a short abstract of no more than 150 words  </p>\n<p><strong>(b) General review of research area</strong> (approx. 50%). A background review which provides a critical insight into where the chosen paper fits into the broader framework of research in that area, and what issues are being addressed in current research. References cited in the Introduction and Discussion of your chosen paper will put you in touch with previous work. Survey the literature for more recent work. (GIVE ACTUAL WORD COUNT AFTER HEADING) Please note that your literature review involves a critical analysis of a single recent research paper and how this impacts on the field. The general review should therefore include a review of the field and identification of knowledge gaps, followed by a discussion of your chosen paper, and finally a section on future direction.</p>\n<p><strong>(c)  The paper </strong>(approx. 25%). A critical appraisal of the work presented in the selected paper and its significance. You should deal with each substantial set of data presented in the paper, and summarise how the experimental technique works and what was found (it may be necessary to read source papers on particular methods). You should also highlight any strengths and/or weaknesses in the experimental design, data presentation, choice of controls etc. It is very helpful to actually include key figures from the paper in this section of your report. Feel free to include your own figure(s) or to modify a figure from the paper or from a related paper. (GIVE ACTUAL WORD COUNT AFTER HEADING)</p>\n<p><strong>(d)  Conclusions and future directions</strong> (approx. 25%). Here you should critically review the conclusions of the paper as presented in the Discussion. Highlight any apparent conflicts with other work in the field, e.g. papers cited by the authors, and compare the major findings with more recent or contemporary papers found during your literature survey and with information you have found in relevant reviews. Finally, consider the direction in which this work is going, identify unanswered questions, and suggest experimental approaches which you feel would be most important to address these issues. (GIVE ACTUAL WORD COUNT AFTER HEADING)</p>\n<p><strong>(e)  Bibliography</strong> include titles of research articles. Include an appendix with URLs for the selected paper and any others you cite extensively. </p>\n<p><strong>(f) Appendices</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assessment of the Literature review </strong></p>\n<p>Each literature review will be assessed by two examiners using the published criteria.</p>\n<p>Marks will be awarded for the quality and \"degree of difficulty\" of the paper selected, the information content and analysis of the literature surveyed, the depth and originality shown in assessing the research and future directions, and layout and English expression.</p>\n<p>Finally, remember that the Literature review must be your own work. You may obtain advice and comment from your supervisor on the ideas in your proposal, and from various sources on whether your English expression is appropriate, but you should not request, or expect, others to rewrite your submission. Acknowledge all help and sources, especially if you quote text and ideas written by others. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
