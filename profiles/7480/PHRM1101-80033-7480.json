You will be allocated a specific drug on which to complete the assignment. The assignment is divided into multiple sections as a guide for the relevant modules, knowledge, resources, and skills you will be applying. Each broad section contains several sub-sections composed of multiple questions. Make sure you respond to all questions and all parts of the question.</p>\n<p>General Points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an individual assignment, and responses will be checked for collusion, plagiarism, and un-referenced Artificial Intelligence (AI) use. AI provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use generative AI in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of generative AI tool in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</li>\n<li>You do not need to cite UQ Extend content, but where other sources of information are used they should be referenced after each response using APA 7th citation style</li>\n<li>Chemical structures can be hand drawn and inserted as an image.
