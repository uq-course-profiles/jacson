You are expected to do modest research, identifying reliable sources and summarising information your find, to succinctly deliver a brief summary to other students. You will also be expected to provide a comparative reflection on your understanding the coreesponding law, policy or legal system in Australia. No research on the Australian system is required, however, students are expected to read the reading relating to comparative legal analysis theory.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim of Assessment</strong>: The purpose of this first task is to inform each other about key aspects of context of the placement country, to hear from each other about expectations for skills building and to begin to think about comparative perspectives of law.</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong>: You must present for approximately 5-7 minutes. You are not expected to provide visual aids such as power point slides or any write up of your presentation. The atmosphere of this workshop is one of conversation and sharing knowledge and perspectives. You are expected to submit a written bibliography of no longer than 1 single-sided page.</p>\n<p><strong>Grading</strong>: The presentations will be marked according to the marking rubric provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst you may use AI technologies, successful completion of this assessment task will require you to critically engage with your experiences.
