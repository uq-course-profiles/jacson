Choose one of these primary sources, read it carefully, describe and analyse its contents, and explain its significance in the context of Chinese history. Do not choose a primary source you have written about for any other course. Do not choose a primary source that is listed for discussion in tutorials. If your primary source is very short, you may choose two related primary sources. If in doubt, please check with your tutor.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your analysis will be assessed according to the following criteria:</p>\n<p>1. Ability to identify author or creator of the item.</p>\n<p>2. Ability to explain the context of the item.</p>\n<p>3. Ability to identify the key components, themes or features that allow critical appreciation.</p>\n<p>4. Ability to explain the significance of the item.</p>\n<p>5. Ability to critique various interpretations of an item and to employ interpretive perspectives, when applicable.</p>\n<p>6. Clear and concise written expression, well presented.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You should structure the paper as a single essay, but make sure you include the required content listed above. Also, please be sure to use Chicago 17A (footnotes and bibliography) to document your use of sources.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To assist in your analysis of this source you may refer to the secondary scholarly literature on the country and period of history in which the source appeared. An extensive bibliography is not required. Five secondary sources are sufficient but more can be used. Footnotes, quotes and bibliography are not included in the word limit of 1000 words (plus or minus 10%).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>AI: This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
