Only include aspects of your lifestyle relevant to health, fitness, diet and exercise. The type of information you might put in the introduction could include – age, gender, history of physical activity/weight, medical conditions that require a special diet or exercise program, current social situation (eg. work, family, living arrangements) and any factors in your local environment that might influence your diet or physical activity. The list here is not prescriptive, you just need to include enough information to enable some determination of whether your goals and plans for diet and physical activity are appropriate for your personal situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals &amp; Strategies</strong></p>\n<p>Your strategies should list how you want to reach your goal (either performance related or related to reducing risk of chronic disease). The goal/strategies should be specific to your situation and you will explain why this goal is important to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>\n<p>You will provide a detailed diet and exercise plan that is designed to achieve the specific goals you have set. The diet plan should include specific detail on one weekly cycle. The exercise plan will be four-weeks demonstrating all activity completed to achieve goal. The purpose of the assignment is to help you enhance your own health and fitness so all aspects of the plan should be specifically related to your own personal situation that you described in the introduction. You will be marked on how well the plan is likely to achieve the goals you have set. You should provide clear justification (using references) for your choice of foods and exercises.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>Marks will be given for clarity of writing, consistency of referencing and overall presentation of the report.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
