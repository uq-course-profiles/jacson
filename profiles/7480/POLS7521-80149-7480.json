The report should be a reflective essay containing your thoughts and reflections about your applied field experience / internship. It should relate your role/position in the organisation to the organisation's overall purpose and it should contain reflections on the various challenges the organisation confronts -- whether organisational, political or something else. You are not expected to advance an argument, as you would for a research paper, but you should place your experience in the context of what you have learned during the previous two semesters of course work. This involves drawing upon some of the theoretical and practical approaches you have studied and applying them to your field experience / internship. You may also want to reflect on how the work you did and the objectives of the organisation fit in with broader objectives of peace and conflict resolution or with broader trends in international relations. In general, this report should be viewed as an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned during your internship and how it relates to the study of international relations or peace and conflict resolution.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
