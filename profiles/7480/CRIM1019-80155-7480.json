The purpose of this assessment is to prompt students to consider the underlying values reflected in a set of policies as well as the intended and unintended consequences stemming from these policies. The short answer questions require you to analyse a policy, apply appropriate concepts, and then utilise research evidence as the basis of your critique and resulting argument for improvements.</p>\n<p>The Assessment Task Sheet, marking criteria and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.
