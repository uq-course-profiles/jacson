As a guide, it is expected that students will do approximately 100 hours of laboratory / field and library work. This may be at any time in the semester that is mutually suitable to the student and supervisor.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Report</strong>: You should write a detailed report (&lt; 2500 words in total, <strong>excluding</strong> title, author name, acknowledgements, references, figures, tables and their legends; however, in-text citations are included in the word count) that is formatted in the style consistent with the requirements of a selected journal. You must not exceed this word limit. Please add the word count on your first page of your report. </p>\n<p>You should discuss with your supervisor which journal would be an appropriate outlet in which to publish the type of research that you have done, and identify the journal in your written report. It is not an expectation that you produce a manuscript or results that are publishable in a peer-reviewed professional scientific journal. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your report will be marked by two academics but not by your supervisor.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledging the contribution of others</strong>: if you have done your project with help from other members of the laboratory you are working in, this should be acknowledged on your first page. Collaborations with others is expected in science, but it must be clear to your markers what is your own work. Contributions include: substantial help with acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, or drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content. If you have been provided with a dataset to analyse, also make this clear in your report (it is sometimes unclear whether the student was given the data or collected it themselves). </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
