Preparing effective oral presentations, like writing effective scientific papers, takes time, but it is time well invested. This assessment item will give you a chance to start building your oral presentation skills.</p>\n<p>Students are to present a 10-15 minute seminar to a laboratory meeting or to the research group, on research undertaken throughout the semester. The seminar can take place during weeks 8-Exam week 1, at a time convenient for the laboratory or research group, and supervisor.

Please do not hesitate to ask for their advice if you are uncertain of any aspects of your project – rules and manners, how to obtain specialised chemicals or commercially purified enzymes, how to use a piece of equipment/software, how to maintain a notebook, etc.</p>\n<p>You need to maintain a record of the work you are doing (commonly using a laboratory notebook) as evidence that the work has been conducted. Recording your work allows others to see the details of what you have done, avoids needless repetition of experiments/data collection, facilitates progression of the work when you have moved on and is needed in support of future publication.</p>\n<p>You are expected to keep a comprehensive record of your day-to-day work, fully dated and indexed. This notebook will contain protocols, details of exactly how work was performed day-to-day (including appropriate weightings, volumes, photographs, search strategies etc.), all raw data (or a note of where voluminous data collections, such as chart recorder traces, are held). </p>\n<p>If your project is literature or computationally based you are still required to maintain a notebook as a record of the work you are doing, and the format can be negotiated with your supervisor, depending on the formats preferred within the lab or research group.  </p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Your report will be prepared using a word processor: page margins will be set to 2cm all round, pages will be numbered, font of 12pt Calibri or Times New Roman (or equivalent) is acceptable, line spacing of 1.5 will be used. One of the arts of scientific writing is to organise ideas and results concisely and with least repetition. The total length, exclusive of references figures and tables, i.e. consisting of the text for the Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion and Conclusions, should not exceed 15 pages (excluding the bibliography). There may be instances, such as industrial placement, where an alternative format is justified, this should be agreed with the course coordinator. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment item has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. Students are required to complete a declaration as to their use of generative AI in this assessment item.
