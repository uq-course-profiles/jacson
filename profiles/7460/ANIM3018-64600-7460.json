Students will develop maps of their study location, using remotely sensed data from open-access government databases and gain experience using QGIS. The mapping exercise assignment will assess student's ability to (1) understand GIS in the context of wildlife science; (2) understand official vegetation classifications used in Queensland; (3) explain the region targeted by the mapping exercise, and (3) create a high–quality map.</p>\n<p>The practical exercises are a major part of this course and provide a hands-on understanding of the theoretical knowledge you will gain through the lectures. Demonstration of the field techniques are compulsory. Learning objectives 2 and 3 cannot be achieved without participating in practicals. This assessment on “Mapping Exercise” cannot be completed unless a student attends practicals throughout the semester. Hence, 80% attendance in practicals is compulsory for this course.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is not allowed in this course and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
