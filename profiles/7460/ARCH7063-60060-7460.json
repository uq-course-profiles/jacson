The thesis should represent a substantial new body of work. No more than 20% of the text can be repeated from earlier submissions. The Thesis should contain a section headed “Prior research included in this Thesis” identifying any sections that draw on research conducted prior to enrolling in ARCH7060 and any prose sections that have been previously submitted for a previous course.</p>\n<p>The Thesis should be presented as a PDF document suitable to be printed at A4 either portrait or landscape format, or A3 landscape format. If the thesis includes video or 3D models embedded in the PDF, make sure to also include 2D still images of this material in case of future media incompatibility.</p>\n<p>Following the examination of the thesis, students will be required to make any recommended corrections or amendments to the satisfaction of the supervisor and course coordinator, and upload the corrected thesis to e-space.</p>\n<p>Students will present a 10-15 minute paper based on one aspect of their research and include a brief overview of how this fits into the thesis.
