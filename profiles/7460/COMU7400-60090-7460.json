PLEASE READ INFORMATION ON BOTH TASKS CAREFULLY AT THIS STAGE ITSELF. </p>\n<p>PROPOSAL IS WORTH 10% OF COURSE GRADE AND FOLLOWING FULL RESEARCH REPORT IS WORTH 20% OF COURSE GRADE = 30%.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCH REPORT PROPOSAL</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to choose a topic: </strong></p>\n<p>To begin, you should spend at least two hours looking at this semester’s topics and the reading lists. If you see something that seems relevant for your future career, download it, and scan read it (no more than 5-10 minutes for each paper you download).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Clearly identify a topic and write a proposal that makes a <strong>proposition of a generic topic and supports it.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some examples of research topics in propositional form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Covid has changed the nature of organizations in a way that requires communication managers to adapt to new organizational processes.</li>\n<li>Because the cultural characteristics of contemporary China are different from the West, communication managers need to be careful in choosing how to conduct communication practices within an organization.</li>\n<li>Managers play an important role in assimilating and acculturating new employees to an organization.</li>\n<li>Managers need to work closely with management to ensure that their ESG reports are not simply greenwashing.</li>\n<li>As the concept of leadership has moved from command-and-control to authentic leadership, the style of communication must also adapt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Once you have identified a topic, prepare your proposal submission for <strong>Week 6 via Turnitin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Submission Format for proposal in Week 6:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please use Times New Roman 12 point font with 1.5 line spacing.</li>\n<li>Include your full name and student number &amp; Title of Topic</li>\n<li>Brief statement of issues involved (about 150 words) plus five references that seem relevant at this stage.</li>\n<li>Use APA (7th) referencing.</li>\n<li>Submit/Upload as a WORD file (not PDF) via Turnitin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will receive feedback on the topic via your Turnitin submission. Once the topic is approved, you must stick to the same, and you may begin the research process keeping in mind that the final report due date. More on that below.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions for the full/final paper are listed below. Grading rubric is on Blackboard .</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Submission Format for final Report due in Week 11:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please use Times New Roman 12 point font with 1.5 line spacing.</li>\n<li>Include your full name and student number &amp; Title of Topic.</li>\n<li>Use APA (7th) referencing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Research Report (Submit as Word doc via Turnitin - PDF not permitted)</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Genre: </strong>This is a research paper genre. This means that you will make a proposition at the start of the paper that you will support by drawing on relevant <strong>academic research</strong> to create clear, linked paragraphs. <strong>This is a short literature review - it is not a position paper where you present your personal views only.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Research Paper Topic</strong></p>\n<p>For the previous task (i.e., proposal) you will have a topic that has been approved within the proposal assessment task. You now must write a short literature review report on this approved topic that supports your proposition (based on academic sources/literature).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You may use up to four course readings in a total of 10-12 <em>academic </em>sources. Unless they are important seminal articles, try to use sources published within the past 9 years (2015). Most should be from academic communication and/or management journals; but other articles/books may be used [Seminal means Strongly influencing later developments. Research that remains strongly influential in contemporary research]. Newspaper articles, news stories, wikipedia do not constitute academic research.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You should ensure that your paragraphs are properly organized. For assistance on paragraphing seek advice from McKenna et al (2007) <em>Corporate Communication : Effective Techniques for Business </em>(2nd ed) which is available in the library. This book also has a chapter on Essays, Literature Reviews, and Research papers (Ch 9).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write 1,000 words (5% tolerance) <em>excluding</em> references (typed, double-spaced)</li>\n<li>Follow APA 6th/7th edition format guidelines</li>\n<li>Include at least 10 <strong>academic</strong> references</li>\n<li>Include up to five subheadings to aid your reader in following your argument</li>\n<li>Follow APA student sample paper available here: <a href=\"https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_sample_paper.html\">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_sample_paper.html</a></li>\n<li>Submission accepted only in WORD (no PDFs allowed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sections of Research Paper</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Statement of Relevance</strong>: Before you begin the paper, you must write no more than 100 words explaining why you chose this topic in terms of its relevance to your future career. This is not assessed as it simply provides the reader with an understanding of your position as the writer.</li>\n<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this section you provide a short summary of around 100-150 words describing what was done and what was found. (This is not included in the word count) See <a href=\"https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html\">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html</a> for how to write an abstract</li>\n<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: This section provides an introduction to your paper. You should identify the focus of your paper, describe the theories or concepts that you are focusing on, and outline how your paper will evolve. (Note that it is acceptable to use first person (<em>I, me, my</em>) and that you will still be expected to insert references if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Body</strong>: In this section you will elaborate the proposition in paragraph 1. There should be about four or five points in support of your proposition. If you have more than this, then you haven’t organised your material effectively. Ensure that there is a topic sentence when you introduce each supporting point (https://purdueglobalwriting.center/topic-sentence-and-paragraph-organization/). Some points may need two or three paragraphs to develop, so it really assists the reader if you use cues like “First, second … “ or the “The major cause of …” . Then another paragraph beginning “A second cause of “ </li>\n<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This often the most difficult to write. A good way to write this paragraph is to go back to the beginning: “This paper set out to … “. Then you can briefly summarise the (up to) five points you made. Finally, you should acknowledge that you haven’t been able to cover everything by identifying areas of interest that may be relevant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
