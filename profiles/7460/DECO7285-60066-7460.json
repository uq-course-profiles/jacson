Teams will follow a complete design cycle of exploring and understanding a problem, eliciting user requirements, designing working software prototypes and testing/evaluating them in real-world situations. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Teams will conduct two iterations of their prototypes, and showcase their design prototypes and processes in week 8 (first iteration) and in week 13 (second iteration). A detailed project report of the complete design and development process is expected at the end of the course.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This team-based assessment will be divided into three smaller-assessment milestones:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Design Exhibit/Presentation of Iteration 1 (week 7): 15%</li>\n<li>Design Exhibit of Iteration 2 (week 13): 25%</li>\n<li>Project Report (14 Nov, 2024): 10%</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Milestone 1 is expected to be a work-in-progress activity, where a prototype will be exhibited during a regular studio session.
