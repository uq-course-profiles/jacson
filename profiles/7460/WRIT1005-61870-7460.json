This development will be visible in your submitted work in this and other classes. Regardless of whether you commence the class as a very novice writer or a very confident writer, you can still get better - but that development is not fully captured by assessing completed work.</p>\n<p>In your  reflection, you will be asked to assess your progress against three of the course's learning objectives. You should provide evidence of your skills and confidence when you started the class and when you finished it, and a warrant that connects your evidence (what you learnt in the class and how it shows up in your writing) to the claim you have made about your development in each area. Your evidence must include discussion of at least one in-class tutorial activity and at least one writing task you completed for this course. You can also include evidence from other writing contexts to supplement this course-specific information.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
