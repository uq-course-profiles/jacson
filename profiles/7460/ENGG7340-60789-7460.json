The contents and structure of the thesis will depend on the Thesis Topic.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the report that you will show to prospective employers as evidence of your ability to manage a project and communicate in a professional and scientific manner. We therefore recommend that you apply yourself to producing this document to a very high standard.</p>\n<h3>Structure</h3>\n<p>As a guide, the Final Report should be 50-70 pages long (excluding front matter, references and Appendices).</p>\n<p>For the general format and submission guidelines, see <a href=\"https://www.mechmining.uq.edu.au/mech-mining-thesis-submission\">Project or Thesis Submission</a>. There are also a number of thesis writing resources on Blackboard that you are encouraged to read and engage with.</p>\n<p>The Report format is flexible, but the following items are expected to be included: </p>\n<p>·     <strong>Title page</strong> (including thesis title, advisor etc.)</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>A summary of the entire thesis containing approximately 1 paragraph each on: background (including supporting literature), research questions/ aims, methods, results, conclusions, and recommendations.</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Include a number of sections that give: a clear definition of the topic, relevance and scope of the research, research questions/aims, outcomes/impact, and a roadmap to the thesis.</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Literature review</strong>         </p>\n<p>Cover background theory, and a review of prior research where applicable. The literature review should support the aims and directions of the research. This section does not need to be called ‘Literature review’ but instead can be titled something that supports your research (e.g. ‘2. Material X: current and potential uses’), and it may be split into more than one section (e.g. ‘3. Common materials used in the manufacture of Y’).</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Methods</strong> (or Experimental Design)        </p>\n<p>This section should detail the method that you use such that the reader could reproduce your results and also assess the reliability of the results.</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Results</strong></p>\n<p>What your method/ experiments found.</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Analysis of results</strong> (or Discussion)         </p>\n<p>What do the results mean? Remember that if the research hasn’t resulted in a positive outcome, you will need to explain why this happened, and in recommendations, you can document where the next researcher should devote their efforts. You should include a sensitivity analysis where you look at the effect of changing your assumptions (e.g. +/1 10%) on your outcomes.</p>\n<p>·     <strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong>      </p>\n<p>The conclusions should summarise your analysis and refer back to your research questions – were they answered. Recommendations as to the next tranche of research should also be made.</p>\n<p>·     <strong>References</strong>      </p>\n<p>The report must demonstrate referencing and include a correctly formatted reference list.</p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI in completing this assessment task.. Students must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
