Assess (i.e., via questionnaires and an interview) a friend or family member on their experiences at work (i.e., pick one area only; stress or motivation) and write up the results and recommendations in a professionally formatted applied report.</p>\n<p>2. Write a critical essay evaluating the organisational literature on a theory, intervention, or practical recommendation that is related to your chosen topic (i.e. stress or motivation). Think of this essay as an appendix to the applied report, which provides the  evidence-base for the main recommendation/s made in your applied report. If a keen human resources professional or manager/supervisor wanted to read more about the science underlying your recommendations, what might they need to know? The essay needs to be in APA format.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Ethical Practice: </strong></p>\n<p>It is expected that you will complete the employee assessment and write up in a professional and ethical manner. The individual who agrees to participate must not be forced or coerced into completing the assessment. You must consider the type of assessments used and the appropriateness of this for the individual. Any information you provide to the individual must be done so sensitively and with their understanding that this is a learning exercise for you. Ethical practice will be discussed in tutorials. You are encouraged to speak to course staff if you have any questions or concerns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
