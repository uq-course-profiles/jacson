Students will learn that both systems are involved in sending signals from one part of the body to another (and also interact with each other): the nervous system can send extremely fast and precisely targeted electrochemical signals from one end of the body to the other; whereas the endocrine system generally broadcasts chemical signals through fluids of the body that trigger responses in tissues sensitive to them. This knowledge is foundational for the understanding of how the anatomy of the nervous system' relates to its role in the coordination and processing of sensory input, coordination of movement of the musculoskeletal system, and its signalling to key physiological rates and states; and understanding how the anatomical arrangement of endocrine organs relate to their function.</p>\n<p><br/></p></p></div></td>",
