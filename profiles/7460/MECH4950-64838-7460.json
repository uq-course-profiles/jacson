Engineers play a significant role in developing and implementing these sustainable energy sources. Effective collaboration among engineers across disciplines and borders is more crucial than ever to make a swift and broad transition to sustainable energy. In this Advanced Engineering course, engineering students at Kyushu University and the University of Queensland will explore the advanced research on green energy conducted at these two universities. Students will also build an international team of engineers, conduct a case study of one selected city with energy problems, and make a group presentation to propose possible solutions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>[Lecture Format] </strong>Online (Live/Zoom)</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
