In the first 200 words of this paper, you should describe the author's main argument; in the remaining 300 words, you should present your views about the author's argument, e.g. Do you find it convincing? Why or why not? What do you think the implications of the argument might be? Have you learnt anything from engaging with this argument?</p>\n<p>Written work in place of tutorial participation must be submitted to your tutor via email. Papers should be submitted to your tutor no later than ONE WEEK after the tutorial you have missed. This is so that you remain up to date with the course reading.
