Tutorials also offer students an important opportunity to develop their skills in legal reasoning and argument in preparation for other Course assessment.</p>\n<p>There will be 10 x 1 hour Tutorials in total throughout the Semester.</p>\n<p>For 5 of these Tutorials, a Tutorial submission (each worth 3%) must be submitted ONLINE into the relevant Tutorial submission folder on Blackboard on the Monday commencing Teaching Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11.<em> (However, please note that the final submission will be due on Tuesday 8th October, due to the Monday Public Holiday).</em></p>\n<p><strong>What do I need to do in preparation for a \"3% Assessable Tutorial\"?</strong></p>\n<p>In preparation for the 5 x assessable Tutorials throughout the Semester, you will answer a question(s) provided to you on Blackboard, prior to the Tutorial week commencing. After uploading your answer to Blackboard (this answer will be your 3% Tutorial submission), you will then attend the on-campus Tutorial that you have enrolled in. It is each student's responsibility to then add to or amend their own Tutorial answer during the Tutorial. Due to time constraints, you will not be provided with detailed feedback about your individual online submission to the Tutorial tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>TUTORIAL ASSESSMENT:</strong></p>\n<p>For each of the 5 assessable Tutorials (Tutorials 1,3,5,7,9) students will be expected to prepare an answer to an ILAC Problem. The purpose of this is:</p>\n<p>(1) to practice answering legal problems in preparation for further Course assessment; </p>\n<p>(2) to further develop your ability to answer legal problems using the ILAC technique; and</p>\n<p>(3) to develop your understanding of Australian Business Law.</p>\n<p>A general feedback document will then be uploaded to Blackboard prior to the following Tutorial submission being submitted.</p>\n<p>For each Tutorial, you must submit a 2 (or more) x A4 page answer to a question posted on Blackboard. This answer must be submitted online (into the online Tutorial submission folder) before 9am on the Monday commencing that Tutorial period. These submissions will be due in Teaching Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, as outlined under \"Learning Activities\" in the ECP. Each answer will then be graded online. The question should not be included as part of your answer. Your answer should be written in size 10 or 12 font, with single line spacing. Headings and correct layout are encouraged as part of the ILAC structure and will be discussed in detail, earlier in the Semester.</p>\n<p><strong>GRADING AND CRITERIA</strong></p>\n<p>Each Tutorial submission will be worth a maximum of 3% of your final grade. Depending upon the quality of the submission, students will receive one of the following grades for their work: 0%, 1.5% or 3%. </p>\n<p>If you submit your answer and your preparation demonstrates a good attempt at the specified task, you will be awarded 3 marks. To receive the full 3 marks, your answers do not have to be correct, but must contain sufficient material to demonstrate that significant effort has been made when answering the question. Answers that do not demonstrate that a significant effort has been made, will not be awarded the full 3 marks.</p>\n<p><strong>LATE PENALTIES</strong></p>\n<p>Any late submission that is subsequently submitted before the next Tutorial submission is due, will be awarded 1.5% if the work is deemed to be of acceptable quality (as outlined above). </p>\n<p>Answers submitted after the following Tutorial submission is due, will be graded 0 (unless a late extension has been granted).</p>\n<p><strong>SUBMISSION DATES</strong></p>\n<p>Tutorial 1 submission is due in Teaching Week 3 on: 5th August at 9.00am</p>\n<p>Tutorial 3 submission is due in Teaching Week 5 on: 19th August at 9.00am</p>\n<p>Tutorial 5 submission is due in Teaching Week 7 on: 2nd September at 9.00am</p>\n<p>Tutorial 7 submission is due in Teaching Week 9 on: 16th September at 9.00am</p>\n<p>Tutorial 9 submission is due in Teaching Week 11 on: TUESDAY 8th October at 9.00am</p>\n<p><strong>USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates each student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The ILAC method is the method you will use to answer all legal problems in LAWS1100. This discussion will help you to prepare for the Ungraded Problem Scenario Question that will be released on Blackboard this week and also the 2nd 3% Tutorial submission that must be submitted by 9am on the Monday of Teaching Week 5. In the second half of this lecture, we will begin to examine the most common area of Tort Law - the Tort of Negligence. In particular, we will look at the first two requirements needed to prove a negligence claim (duty of care and breach of duty). Negligent misstatement (applicable to those providing advice such as professional accountants) will be discussed as part of the law to do with establishing a \"duty of care\". The third requirement (causation) as well as potential Defences to a negligence claim, will be discussed in Teaching Wk 4.",
