The aim of this assignment is to apply one key theory or concept discussed in class (or to be discussed in class) to a case to produce an interesting insight about the movement/event. Key theories and concepts include, but are not limited to: consent, power, strategic nonviolence, everyday resistance, discourse, intersectionality, decolonisation, indigenous politics, the affective and emotive character of resistance, the visual character of resistance, and so on. A more extensive list will be shared on Blackboard and discussed in class.</p>\n<p>The document should make one key point that can stand alone. In other words, the reader should need no prior knowledge of the case to understand the contribution. Although it is acceptable to rely on news articles for current cases, and on popular culture media for fictional cases, the document must also be supported by academic references.
