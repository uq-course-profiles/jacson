Your presentation should not just summarise the contents of the paper, but should push the group to discuss larger issues/questions that arise from the paper. You are encouraged to draw on additional source material to supplement your presentation, if it would advance the discussion. Given the technical material included in some of the papers covered in the course, it is entirely reasonable for a presentation to be structured around collaboratively learning about the material.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will not be assessed on your mastery of the material covered in the paper you are basing your presentation on. Rather, you will be assessed based on how effectively you are able to engage the group and facilitate collective learning and productive discussion during the session. This can be achieved by creating a tutorial-style presentation of the material with opportunities for questions-and-answers. It can also be achieved by building a presentation around a broader question/issue that includes the paper as a concrete example (e.g., \"How should we think about X?\" using a specific paper as a jumping-off point to start or structure the discussion).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
