These components contribute to your overall performance in the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you are enrolled concurrently in another Year 3 and/or 4 course/s, other than the Personalised Learning Course, four components of the CPA contribute to the other course/s (Clinical Communication, History taking, Examination Skills, Clinical Reasoning) and the remaining components (Engagement in Practice, Professional Practice, Reflective Practice, Social/Cultural Competence and Safety and Student Flag) contribute to the WLP course.</li>\n<li>If you are not enrolled concurrently in another course, all CPA components contribute to this WLP course.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additional information may be received by staff from clinical placement site/s where you completed this course.

For example, if your supervisor rated you as satisfactory related to professional conduct but the Medical School has other information available, the supervisor’s ratings may be moderated based on this additional information.</p>\n<p>Your performance will also be reviewed at the End of Semester Examiner’s meeting and following discussion you may receive a non-graded fail for the course, if: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are any unsatisfactory results recorded in any of the CPA components contributing to this course (including moderations made by the Course Coordinator)</li>\n<li>There are four or more borderline results recorded in any of the CPA components contributing to this course (including moderations made by the Course Coordinator)</li>\n<li>The required number of CPAs have not been submitted to your supervisor for completion by the due date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Factors that will be taken into account during the review undertaken at the End of Semester Examiner’s meeting include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence of temporal improvement in performance across the course (if applicable)</li>\n<li>Completion and content of the WLP Task Review in response to unsatisfactory or borderline ratings</li>\n<li>Relative opportunity available across the semester</li>\n<li>Other factors relevant to your performance</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
