A workshop will be held at UGM (or community site) to provide an opportunity for all groups to present their findings to the stakeholders they have worked with during their time in Yogyakarta. As such, each group needs to prepare and deliver a professional presentation in this workshop to their peers, course staff and external stakeholders.</p>\n<p>It is up to your group as to how you prepare and deliver this presentation but please make sure that you all equally participate in specific tasks. Following the presentation, however, group members will have the opportunity to complete a <em>confidential peer review form</em> if they believe that not all group members equally contributed.</p>\n<p>Groups will also need to prepare a 4-page written brief that can be submitted to all stakeholders that summarises your project (2 pages) and provides the 1-2 life histories that your group collected. The brief should be submitted in English and Bahasa Indonesia.</p>\n<p>This is a compulsory assignment for all students. All students need to take part in the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Group work:</strong> Group work skills and expectations are discussed in the workshops at UQ (prior to the trip) and the start of the activities in Yogyakarta, where both UQ and UGM are present and have formed the groups. If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment task to be completed without use of AI:</strong> This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Try and consider how the day’s activities expanded, changed or influenced your thinking, and then also consider how the literature that you have read has helped you to make sense of these experiences and interactions. References to the arguments in the literature are expected.</p>\n<p>How does what you have read in the literature match up (or not) with what you are seeing, hearing, feeling, experiencing? Is the literature helpful in ‘making sense’ of what you’re experiencing in Indonesia? You might have some questions ‘triggering’ your own reflection. You could include how was the impact of the activity in your own learning or personal life.</p>\n<p> At the start of each day you might also want to write a few sentences or questions about what you expect from that day – what you’ll see, what you’ll learn, what you’ll experience. Then when you go to write your reflection at the end of the day, see if it matches up (why/why not) with your expectations for that day.</p>\n<p>See full details in Blackboard and course workbook. </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment task to be completed without use of AI:</strong> This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
