Each map is to have the names of the authors on it. Each group must also submit one labeled sample of each major rock and ore type. The specimens are not to be more than 15 cm across nor less than 10 cm. No more than 10 samples per group. </p>\n<p> In addition, each individual will be required to submit:</p>\n<p> • a cross-section of the prospect drawn on one of the grid lines at a scale of 1:500</p>\n<p> • a brief (1 page) description of geological structure (dip of strata, cleavage, faults, joints, etc.).</p>\n<p> • a description of the type of mineralization and its relationship to the host rocks.</p>\n<p>Once back in Brisbane, we will examine polished thin sections of samples from the prospect area studied. Each group will describe the thin sections, interpret the geological and geophysical (if available) data, and write a report evaluating the economic viability of the prospect and suggesting any additional work that should be done in the area.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
