(No classes in Week 11 due to public holiday).</p>\n<p><strong>Assignment outline:</strong> Debate is a fundamental part of democratic discourse. Contested and controversial issues are acted out in public, with different perspectives discussed and argued. Sociologists use the term ‘public arenas of debate’ and communication theorists use ‘discourse arenas’ to describe places where public debate takes place – e.g. public meetings, protests, exhibitions, press conferences, social media campaigns, videos, lobbying meetings, street parades, and more.</p>\n<p>We will make our classroom ‘public arenas’ to communicate and discuss a range of social issues and problems. You will run an ‘arena’ from a list supplied and allocated in class. </p>\n<p>Your main materials must be original although you may use secondary sources (e.g. YouTube clips) to support your content. Preference is given for wholly original work and students are encouraged to be creative as well as evidence-based in their arenas. While you may run your arena from a dominant perspective, you should acknowledge alternative interests and perspectives from other stakeholders/publics at some point in your arena. You are encouraged not to rely on PowerPt. Excessive reliance on slides or notes will result in marks deducted. This is a creative, innovative, and imaginative opportunity which will be reflected in the marking criteria. </p>\n<p>The assignment should integrate two parts:</p>\n<p>Part 1 (30%)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your analysis, discussion, and execution of the topic to the class in your chosen ‘arena’ </li>\n<li>Generate and incorporate input and discussion from your seminar (class) group </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part 2 (10%)</p>\n<p>Submit an INDIVIDUAL 500-word reflective summary of your topic the week following your seminar session to Turnitin that incorporates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>key themes covered</li>\n<li>rationale for selection of chosen arena</li>\n<li>how all/alternate positions/interests were acknowledged and addressed</li>\n<li>group work breakdown (inc. Gantt chart) </li>\n<li>Use APA referencing as appropriate (key references)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All team members must attend and contribute to their seminar to be awarded a mark. </p>\n<p>A topic list will be supplied on Blackboard and discussed in class. Only one group in each class can do each topic (from the list supplied). Students running the seminars in Week 9 will have first choice of topic. After that, the tutor will assign groups to topics and seminar weeks (10 &amp; 12). Due to the tight schedule, these dates will be final. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI &amp; MT: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Recording of Oral and Practical Assessment: </strong>When a student is required to complete a live oral or practical assessment item worth 20% or more, the performance will be recorded in accordance with Appendix 1 of the Assessment Procedure and retained as the official recording of the item for re-mark purposes.  </p>\n<p>The Associate Dean (Academic) may waive the recording of an assessment performance under clause 89 if they are satisfied that one or more of the following apply:</p>\n<p>a.  The assessment occurs in a setting where recording is not permitted (e.g. a clinical setting where recording of patients will compromise patient privacy and confidentiality);</p>\n<p>b.  There is an inability to feasibly record the content required to inform examiner judgment equivalent to the original performance (e.g. face-to-face clinical assessments such as the objective structure clinical examinations (OSCEs)); or</p>\n<p>c.   The filming process will disrupt the assessment performance and/or compromise assessment validity.</p>\n<p>As per point C, above, in order not to disrupt the assessment or compromise assessment validity of this assessment, extensive written notes will be taken instead of recording. These notes will be written up in a timely fashion and moderated. In addition, all students' short reflection on this task, submitted via TurnItIn, will provide a pathway for thorough and timely written feedback.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
