The assessment is not considered submitted until both parts are received following the instructions below.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>PART A: Drawing on the knowledge you have gained from the WRIT1001 course content, you are to produce an argumentative essay as taught in the course. You are not to write your own essay on your own topic—you must improve the provided essay produced by generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT).</p>\n<p>The essay produced by a generative AI will be provided to you on the Monday of Week 13 at 12pm (in the assessment folder). Part A of this task asks you to improve upon the AI-generated model essay, bringing its quality up to university standard with the skills you have learned on this course, including critical argumentation, logical structure, detailed research skills, appropriate and valid referencing of sources, etc.</p>\n<p>As the AI essay is short, you will also need to increase it to the required word count of approximately 1200 words.

Submit Word or PDF file of argumentative essay to the Turnitin link on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>2. Upload video reflection also via Turnitin on Blackboard. Instructions on how to do this will be sent before the assessment is due.</p>\n<p>1) At the START of the video, you must talk to the camera (ie NOT a photograph) and introduce yourself clearly showing your UQ ID card on FULL SCREEN. If you do not have a UQ ID card, please use a passport or valid Australian driver’s license with your name in English. If the marker cannot see your ID clearly, your video will be considered not submitted.</p>\n<p>2) Presentations must be <strong>under 3 minutes</strong> - submissions significantly longer will have marks deducted.</p>\n<p>3) ALWAYS check your UQ email before and after submission of assessments, as this is the only way we have to contact you if there is a problem.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------</p>\n<p>Your written assessment must be new work that you have written this semester. Do not submit previously completed work.</p>\n<p>Submitted work which is suspected to have used ghost-writing services will be investigated for academic misconduct and potentially face severe academic penalties.  </p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI &amp; MT Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
