These exams are centrally controlled and run using a separate Blackboard site. You will be advised of the date and time in which to complete the examination once the examination timetable has been determined. Note that late penalties will be strictly applied as per university policy.</p>\n<p>The examination will be centrally timetabled and in the form of a Blackboard Test (Part A) in combination with Blackboard Asssignment (Part B). The exam should be completed within a 120 minutes duration with a 10-minute perusal time - there is also a 15-minute upload allowance. The exam will be available and open during the Examinations Period for 130 minutes (+ 15 minutes submission) starting at the time specified in the student's personal examination timetable (to be announced prior to week 13 of semester). Note that there will be a 15 minutes submission period in total so the students need to complete both parts of the exam within the 130 minutes + 15 minutes submission starting at the time specified in the student's personal examination timetable. The exam will not auto-submit - students need to monitor the time they take on the exam. Students need to complete the exam within the allocated time, any exams submitted late will have a late penalty applied. If the exam is commenced after the specified time, the end for the examination does not change. There will be no requirement for identity certification.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Structure of exam</p>\n<p>The aim of the exam is to examine what you understand about the application of MR theory to the MRI experiment, the origin of contrast generated by clinically relevant sequences and the origin of image artefacts. The exam will be divided into two parts. Part A will mostly consist of True/False and Multiple Choice questions in the form of an online Blackboard quiz and should be answered and submitted online. Part B will be in the form of short answer type questions which may include the requirement for hand-written sketches and calculations to be performed. You can print the Part B of the exam and write on</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
