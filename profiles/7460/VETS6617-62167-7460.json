Individual assessment tasks will detail any form of acceptable use of AI across all courses. Use of AI outputs without attribution is a form of plagiarism which is unacceptable and constitutes academic misconduct. Assessment will always centre on critical appraisal of student knowledge, skills and attributes. This may include students’ critical reflection and application of AI within their discipline. This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies for submitted responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Honours Authenticity Report must be submitted one week prior to the submission of the literature review.

The use of the Honours Authenticity Report in conjunction with your academic supervisors oversight has been designed to authenticate and document the student's understanding of the topic and scientific principles, contained in their literature review. Students may use AI as a learning tool; to hone their understanding of a topic and improve their scientific writing style.
