As chair, we will ask you to begin with a ~10 minute ‘journal club style’ presentation outlining the study question, the main (or most important) methods used and the conclusions drawn. This will be followed by open discussion of the paper. Each journal club presentation will comprise 10% of your final mark for the course. You are expected to read all papers in advance even if you are not the chair! This format mirrors a typical weekly meeting for research groups where discussing publications is an important aspect of staying current in science.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
