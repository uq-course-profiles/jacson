Library catalogues, scientific journal databases and internet sites are expected to be searched to locate appropriate overviews and cutting edge information. Take care to ascertain that the information obtained has been rigorously reviewed and is not simply of a promotional nature. This is particularly important when using information downloaded from the Internet.\n<p>Presentation information: Your presentation should have the following structure:</p>\n<p><em>Title page</em> (<strong>1 slide</strong>): Chosen topic, name and student number</p>\n<p><em>Outline</em> (<strong>1 or 2 slides</strong>): Illustrating the structure of the presentation</p>\n<p><em>Introduction</em> (<strong>6 to 8 slides</strong>): Presenting topic key concepts and provide background information leading into the topic.</p>\n<p><em>Topic key concepts</em> (<strong>6 to 8 slides</strong>): Provide detailed topic information, ensuring the main concepts are explained clearly and concisely.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Figures, illustrations and diagrams (as appropriate)</em>: Supporting the presentation and should come with figure captions.</li>\n<li><em>Text:</em> The topic is a (MS power-point or similar) presentation, therefore text should be concise but sufficiently detailed for reader to understand the key concepts presented. To keep the slides clear use 1 concept per 1 bullet point with 3 concepts maximum per slide.</li>\n<li><em>Equations</em>: Used only to support your concepts if necessary and keep the equation numbers to a minimum. Each equations variables and terms used must be explained and their relevance highlighted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Advantages and disadvantages, limitations and drawbacks</em> (<strong>4 to 7 slides</strong>): Point out how the key technique fits within the broader MRI or medical imaging field. How useful is the topic of choice in practice? What are the applications?</p>\n<p><em>Directions</em> (<strong>1 to 3 slides</strong>): What kind of research and developments were outcomes of the findings within the area of your chosen topic?</p>\n<p><em>Summary (</em><strong>1 slide</strong><em>)</em>: List the key topic points of your findings</p>\n<p><em>References (as needed)</em>: All material used from the internet, photos, books, and journal papers etc. require proper referencing. Reference style can be chosen freely but must be consistent (see Learning resources chapter 3.5 for more details). These slides are not counted in the total slide count.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number of slides or text length does not lead automatically to a higher/better mark. It also depends on how clearly and concisely key concepts and topics are described. For example, the choice of using text over figures, and vice versa may result in more or less slides to describe the same thing.</p>\n<p>Example numbers in italic have been added as an illustration of how the marks are allocated.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
