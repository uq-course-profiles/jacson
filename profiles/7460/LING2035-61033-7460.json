In the task, you will conduct a small-scale case study on production and perception of sociolinguistic marker 'yeah-no', and other discourse markers, in English.</p>\n<p>Steps in the data collection:</p>\n<p>1. Find a speaker of English from your personal network (friends and friends-of-friends) and obtain their consent to participate in your project. Ensure that they are not participating in other recordings, and ensure they are not students of this course (present or past). </p>\n<p><em>NOTE: Some students do not have ready access to a speaker of English in their network and time will be given in class for students to pair up and ‘share’ an interviewee.</em></p>\n<p>2. Conduct an audio recorded, 30-60 minute interview with your participant to elicit their natural production of 'yeah-no' in conversational speech. In the case of interview pairs, one student will conduct an interview with the participant to elicit natural production of ‘s/he’s like’. Record the interview with an audio recording device (smart phone, microphone, laptop, etc.).</p>\n<p>3. Administer a series of short questionnaires to your participant, investigating their implicit and explicit attitudes to the use of 'yeah-no'/s/he’s like as well as recording their background information.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to submit a data that will be made up of the following elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data (audio recording of the interview and interview transcript) </li>\n<li>A copy of the participant's signed consent form</li>\n<li>Completed questionnaires</li>\n<li>A brief field report with description of the data and source, some interpretation and reflection on your experience using this sociolinguistic method. For this element - word limit 500 words, +/- 10%</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each component of the small-scale study (including the necessary forms and questionnaires) has been pre-designed by the course coordinator and will be made available to students via the course Blackboard site. Each step of the study design will be explained in detail in lectures and tutorials, as outlined in Section 4, 'Learning activities' of the ECP.</p>\n<p><strong>AI and Machine Translation</strong>: This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
