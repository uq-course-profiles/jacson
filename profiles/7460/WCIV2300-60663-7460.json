Your group will pick the play and scene to stage, and each member of the group should have a speaking or acting role, however small. You will not be marked on your acting ability, but you must demonstrate familiarity and ease with the script; you'll also be marked on the quality and depth of your reflection and on your creative approaches to the task. You will have approximately 30 minutes to deliver your scene, although you need not take up this entire allowance of time. The essay must be uploaded by 2pm on Tuesday, 17 September, and your performance will happen in your seminar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More details on this assessment will be available through the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The University has a collection of resources to assist students with teamwork.
