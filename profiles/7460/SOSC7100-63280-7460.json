Students are strongly advised to read previous theses to get a sense of approach and consult with their advisor as well as Program Director.</p>\n<p><strong>Outline of the Thesis (indicative): </strong>Theses presented in the Program involve a wide variety of legitimate approaches and structures. The following outline of how a report might be constructed is intended only as a general guide to the key issues that might normally be addressed.</p>\n<p>1. Statement of the research problem - context of the research, theoretical or intellectual background in which the problem arises, why this is a significant problem, general formulation of the research problem.</p>\n<p>2. Central research - question provide your own conceptualisation of the problem, indicate your central argument and any hypotheses you may have developed on the subject. How will your research contribute to solving the problem? Subsidiary questions and limitations.</p>\n<p>3. Review of previous research - critical review of the literature designed to locate your research in the context of previous published work. Organised presentation of the major streams or schools of research and where your work is located. Identify unresolved issues or gaps in the literature. Locate your work in an academic dialogue and show how/where your research contributes.</p>\n<p>4. Research procedure - how you intend executing the task you have identified above. Detail your theoretical or conceptual framework. Are you adjudicating between competing or rival accounts? Describe your research design and method of approach. Describe any special analytical techniques and any important methodological issues.</p>\n<p>5. Research findings - provide an account of what your research shows. This section should focus on your theoretical, conceptual and analytical account of the findings reported.</p>\n<p>6. Conclusion - you now should review your analysis presented above in the light of your introduction and your review of previous research. What has your research added? What has it shown to be flawed? How have your research hypotheses been revised as a result of your research and analysis? It should also be noted that the thesis will usually be assessed by an academic identified by your supervisor within the school that your supervisor is located.</p>\n<p>Formatting: Use the UQ's Assignment Writing Guide: <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/study-skills/assignment-writing/steps-writing-assignments\">Steps for writing assignments - my.UQ - University of Queensland</a></p>\n<p>The length of the body of the thesis (from the first page of the first or introductory chapter to the final page of the concluding chapter) should be no more than 12,000 words. Text in figures, diagrams and tables is excluded from the word count. Fore-pages (title page up to the first page of the first or introductory chapter), appendices, and references/bibliography are excluded from the word count and page count. Confine yourself within the limit, as excessive length will be penalised. Note that appendices must contain only auxiliary material that is too detailed, technical or complex to be included in the body of the thesis but which is referred to in the thesis and is essential for the reader’s reference (for example technical details of statistical formulae, questionnaires, lengthy or complex tabular data or information that cannot be printed on a single page, even if folded).</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
