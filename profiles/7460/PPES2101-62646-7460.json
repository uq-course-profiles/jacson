Please relate your analysis to the conceptual literature on problem/policy framing [such as Carol Bacchi (2009) or BG Peters article (2005)].</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine that there has been a policy debate about whether ONLINE BETTING is a problem and whether it therefore should be tolerated, encouraged, regulated or banned.</p>\n<p>Your task would be to 'unpack' how a government policy assumes a particular view of the problem; or how different groups might interpret the policy problem from different perspectives.</p>\n<p>Some might regard all betting as morally offensive and as exploitation of vulnerable people. Others might regard betting as a personal choice and consistent with personal freedom and responsibility, and thus not a 'problem' requiring regulation. Some might regard the advertising of betting opportunities as inappropriate for children. Others might argue that online betting is deeply problematic because it is controlled by international corporations. These (and other) positions tend to be linked to different attitudes towards this powerful and growing industry. Some may want to ban specific forms of betting and advertising; others may want to protect children; some may focus on protecting gambling addicts and vulnerable families. Others might take a 'laissez-faire' attitude and regard it as a normal investment opportunity in a market society or as a harmless recreation activity. </p>\n<p>Remember: this is not an exercise in 'solving' the problem - it is an exercise in delineating how a problem has been characterised, and whether these interpretations reveal a narrow or comprehensive understanding of the problem.  </p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

Please relate your answer to the literature on criteria for assessing success and failure, such as the various writings of Alan McConnell and/or the work of Leutjens and t'Hart.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Select a policy example where the government has been actively pursuing a particular \"policy solution\" for some time (perhaps in conjunction with other partners).</p>\n<p>There are many examples that could be selected, ranging from PPPs in transport infrastructure, to offshore immigration control, to renewable energy, to pandemic response, etc.</p>\n<p>The underlying challenge is to think analytically about assessing the extent of success or failure. What would be some useful criteria? - for example, some criteria would be political (e.g. electoral popularity and community support). Other criteria would relate to the competence and reliability of the program itself (e.g. administrative efficiency, collaborative capacity). And other criteria might focus on actual outcomes or benefits (e.g. were services improved, were the promised results delivered?). It is likely you will need to use several criteria. And what if the results are mixed or 'grey'? Having decided on some criteria, <strong>apply</strong> them to a brief analysis of the chosen 'policy solution'. </p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
