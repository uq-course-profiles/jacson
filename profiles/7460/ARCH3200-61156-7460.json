The report will include activities completed each week during studios and set homework tasks. You will produce approximately 1-2 A3 pages of work per week for discussion during studio, which will form the basis of your assessment submission. This assessment task is the foundation for Assessment 2.</p>\n<p>Assessment 1 requires you to produce a 10-page A3 graphic report, structured in two parts. The report will include a combination of graphic elements (orthogonal and 3D drawings, mapping, sketches, diagrams, and photographs) and annotative text (maximum font size 12 for body text). The report will contain two parts:</p>\n<p>Part 1 - Research and Analysis</p>\n<p>Part 2 - Design Brief and Conceptual Design</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment task to be completed without use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed.  It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission.</p>",
