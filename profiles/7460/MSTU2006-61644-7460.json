It requires you to use two of the course's weekly topics as a starting point for further exploration. You may develop an essay that draws connections across topics from the first and second halves of the course, or two from just the second half. A good way to start is to use a key discussion point from one of the weekly seminars - find something that interested you and that sparks your curiosity in some way. Find another from another week. Try to bring the two together to design a question that can drive your essay. The question for your essay should be one that you could answer through a detailed comparative analysis of two films and/or TV examples - both of which are from the library course list -- and drawing on readings from the UQ Library course list.</p>\n<p>Your research question (including the topic weeks it relates to), should be at the top of page 1 of your essay.</p>\n<p>No other sources may be used for this essay without prior approval. Lisa will compile a list of further approved essay sources. Email <a href=\"mailto:l.bode@uq.edu\">l.bode@uq.edu</a> to have further sources for your essay pre-approved and added to the list.
