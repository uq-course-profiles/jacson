The exam/assignment is worth 30 mark, which is equal to 30% of the overall mark. The exam rule states that students must achieve at least 45% of the marks for this examination to pass the course and a pass grade overall of 4 or higher. That means you must get more than 13.5/30 in the final exam to pass. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Structure of exam:</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the exam is to examine what you understand about the application of theory to the MRI experiment. The exam is open-book and consists of 6 questions with multiple sub-questions similar in structure to the assignments given during the course. There will be no multiple choice questions. You should attempt all parts of the questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Materials in exam:</strong></p>\n<p>This is an open book exam. </p>\n<p><strong>Exam technique:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Do’s  </em></p>\n<p>Read the instructions and questions carefully.</p>\n<p>Understand and analyse the question.</p>\n<p>Answer the question that has been set.</p>\n<p>Attempt to answer all parts of the question.</p>\n<p>Make your diagrams and calculations clear.
