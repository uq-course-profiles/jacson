Each scenario has a number of videos relevant to the scenario that can be analysed. The group will be required to define the main aim of the analysis and define the quantitative or qualitative variables or principles that you will analyse in any number of the provided videos. The group will then perform a quantitative and/or qualitative analysis based on the video/s and present any key findings.</p>\n<p>You will have to submit a group report outlining the following -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clearly define the aim of your analysis, including a breakdown of any key biomechanical principles that will contribute to your analysis.</li>\n<li>Analyse the motion using appropriate anatomical and biomechanical principles using measurement tools within a video analysis software package, to provide a biomechanical description of the motion.</li>\n<li>Present the analysis within a document describing the aims, breakdown of movement and analysis/calculations and any appropriate graphical representation of the analysis.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A basic template for the report will be provided for this submission.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Analysis component (600 word maximum)</em></strong></p>\n<p>The analysis component is divided into two main sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Interpretation of data and recommendations:</em></strong> You will need to interpret the data that you have collected and analysed with your group and provide key outcomes of the analysis with respect to the aims outlined. You should interpret this data with respect to biomechanical theory or any relevant research literature (appropriately cited) and provide recommendations or potential intervention strategies based on the scenario requirements or highlight key limitations in the approach and/or future directions for investigation.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Reflection on practice:</em></strong> Provide a brief reflection of how the group see the skills you have learnt in this assignment, or in the course more generally, for conducting a movement analysis might be able to add to the needs of a client, colleague or student.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your group assignment will be graded based on both the group component and analysis components. There will also be peer assessment of your contribution to the group, which will be decided by the other members of your group. Please ensure you include a grade (0-3) for each of the individual group members contribution based on the criteria Group Work Contribution criteria, which can be found below.</p>\n<p>e.g. Group Work Contribution: Jill Bliggs = 3, Joe Bloggs = 3, Issac Newton = 2.</p>\n<p>You may wish to include some justification for the scores you leave, particularly if you give a very low score to an individual student. DO NOT PROVIDE A GRADE FOR YOURSELF. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<p>The software package for the video analysis is called Kinovea (www.kinovea.org) and is a freely available software package for Windows. This is also available at all library computers.
