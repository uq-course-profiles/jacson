This is what we call a middle ring suburb, still relatively affordable and not too far from the city. Banyo is well serviced by rail and bus and has a small commercial hub with convenience retail and commercial spaces. The large flat site will be used as our subject site for this studio. The site will accommodate a diversity of housing types including a 0.5 hectare parcel for our co-housing project which will be the subject of our second assignment. Further design brief details will be available in the course reader uploaded to Blackboard. Digital site information including a basic site survey and aerial photo are available for download.</p>\n<p><strong>PART 2</strong>: Case Study Housing (20%)<strong> </strong> – Group Submission</p>\n<p>Housing is a problem that must be considered at many levels, from policy, to the design of towns, suburbs, and precincts, to understanding precedent housing that has been recognised as delivering good outcomes for residents. Our first task will be to address two of these considerations, the design of a community and research into best practice housing types. The first assessment will be completed in a group comprising of 3 to 4 students. Group formation will occur in the first week of studio and will be formed by self-selection. The second part of the assessment task will involve the documentation of several case study housing projects chosen from Southeast Queensland. Each group will be assigned a case study to document. Further details of the case studies and the presentation format are available in the course reader and information uploaded onto Blackboard.</p>\n<p>For both parts the work will be completed as a group. Work will be submitted individually along with a completed peer evaluation rubric. Note that the peer evaluation will be common across both parts. The peer evaluation rubric will generate a multiplying factor that will be applied to the group grade to determine the final individual grade. Therefore, if your performance was deemed inadequate by the group consensus, your grade will be adjusted downwards to reflect the disparity in performance.</p>\n<p>The peer evaluation template will be issued as an Excel spreadsheet where you are to complete the fields and submit the spreadsheet with your assessment submission. Note that submissions without the peer evaluation spreadsheet are deemed to be INCOMPLETE. The spreadsheet MUST be submitted as an Excel document. DO NOT save as a .pdf format as the data cannot be integrated into the marking.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI or MT to support learning:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task.

There is another missing middle though, these are the families who do not qualify for social housing but are unable to adequately sustain a private rental or purchase a house in our current overheated and expensive housing market. Affordable and tenure secure housing is the largest oversight in the housing debate and a difficult one to execute by the private sector. Tennant led initiatives that use a form of shared equity to reduce the cost of purchase, construction, and ownership are gaining attention.One of these models that is gaining attention in Australia is co-housing. It not only promises a more affordable form of living but is also provides a more social and connected form of living.</p>\n<p>We will be building on work undertaken in the 2023 Dwelling and Density studio. Our client is the advocacy group Housing Oolder Women. We will be designing a co-housing community using the brief we developed in studio with HOW in 2023. You will be using the site set aside in the first assignment and design the project using in such a way that it will be a showcase for good suburban integration, sustainable density, high environmental and social performance, and adopting one of the forms of modern methods of construction we will explore in studio.
