You should develop the project plan through consultation with your supervisor.</p>\n<p><strong>Format of Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The plan should be prepared using a word processor. The page margins should be set to 2cm all round, the pages should be numbered and 12pt Calibri (or equivalent) or Times New Roman (or equivalent) fonts should be used. The first page of the plan (not counted in the total number of pages) should carry your project title, your name and student number, and your supervisor’s details. The maximum length of the plan should be an 8 page introduction plus a 1 page plan.</p>\n<p><strong>The first part of the project plan</strong> should be a thorough introduction to your area of research, which should be produced through careful consideration of the current scientific literature (and any company documentation where relevant) pertinent to the project. </p>\n<p><strong>The second part of the project plan</strong> should include a brief description of the main aim(s) of your research project, followed by a brief outline of the proposed research strategies that you will use to meet the aims of your project. No more than one page should be used for this section.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

They allow you to establish stronger contact with the audience and better convince them of your viewpoint through verbal and nonverbal delivery, as well as the ensuing interaction. Oral presentations have a price, however, in terms of the audience's time. If you give a poor 15-minute presentation to an audience of 200 people, you have wasted the equivalent of 50 hours of work — more than a week of someone's work time. Preparing effective oral presentations, like writing effective scientific papers, takes time, but it is time well invested. This assessment item will give you a chance to start building your oral presentation skills.</p>\n<p>Give a 15 minute presentation to your supervisor and research group members at the end of semester.</p>\n<p>Detailed information can be found below under More Information.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in assessment</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
