You have 60 minutes and one attempt to complete each task.</p>\n<p>After all ten Online Study Tasks are completed, your total study task score will be calculated. Please note that tasks not completed and awarded 0 points are included in the average calculation. The percentage of the maximum achievable points will determine your final grade for this assessment.</p>\n<p>The link to each week's Online Study Task will be available on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking Information</strong></p>\n<p>The weekly Online Study Tasks must be accessed, completed, and submitted via Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Answers will be assessed automatically, and results will be made available to students within the week of submission. Answers to questions will be rated as correct or incorrect. For each correct answer, students will receive 1 point. Each Online Study Task consists of 10 questions, and there are 10 tasks in total, meaning students can earn up to 100 points if they answer all questions correctly.

For this task, you need to find a dataset consisting of at least 3 columns of which at least one must contain numeric values. You then need to record a 10-minute presentation in which you describe, summarise, and visualise the dataset. In addition, you need to motivate and formulate at least one research question that you could answer based on the dataset. The motivation for answering the research question should be based on a gap in the existing body of research. Finally, we want you to elaborate on how you would proceed to answer, in detail, the research question (be specific!).</p>\n<p>Below, you will find some pointers on what questions should be answered in your presentation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Source</strong>: where does the data come from or how was it compiled?</li>\n<li><strong>Overview</strong>: What variables does the data set consist of and what do the variables represent? How many observations does the dataset contain?</li>\n<li><strong>Variables</strong>: What are the levels of categorical variables? What are mean, standard deviation, range, etc. of numeric variables?</li>\n<li><strong>Distributions</strong>: What are the distributions of the variables in the data set? (you can use tables and visualisations to address this)</li>\n<li><strong>Research question</strong>: What is a research question, that extends existing research, could be answered based on this dataset?</li>\n<li><strong>Possible research</strong>: How would one have to proceed to answer the research question based on the dataset?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prepare slides for your presentation and record yourself and the slides (we suggest you use Zoom and share your screen). The entire presentation should be between 9 and a maximum of 11 minutes (recordings must not be longer than 11 minutes). Your answers should be presented as a coherent, clear, logical, and engaging manner. Any sources and citations mentioned in your presentation need to be added in a reference list at the end of your presentation (which should also be formatted according to APA7).</p>\n<p>Your slides and your presentation should be engaging and informative. Your slides should not be too text heavy, and the slides should contain the main aspects of what you say/present. Use appropriate language without errors both on the slides and in your presentation. You are welcome to use visualisations and tables created by yourself and/or from the articles. Your face needs to be visible during the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement on Gen AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

It offers an opportunity to engage with a real-world, language- or culture-related data set chosen by the student, honing your abilities to describe, summarize, visualize, and quantitatively analyse data. By undertaking this assessment, you will gain insights into the approaches and practices employed by data analysts in the field.</p>\n<p>For the Statistical Analysis Report, you are required to write a concise report, limited to 2000 words (excluding R code, R output, and references). It is crucial that you also include the R code you use in the analysis. The report should encompass the following key aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Motivation and Research Question: Begin by providing a clear rationale for your research question, explaining its significance and relevance to the field of study.</li>\n<li>Hypothesis Formulation: Develop a hypothesis that corresponds to your research question, demonstrating a hypothesis-driven approach to your analysis.</li>\n<li>Data Description, Tabulation, and Visualization: Thoroughly describe the dataset utilized in your analysis, employing appropriate tables, figures, and visualizations to present the data in a comprehensive manner.</li>\n<li>Statistical Analysis Description: Describe the statistical techniques and methods employed to analyse the data. Provide a detailed explanation of the chosen approaches, justifying their relevance to the research question.</li>\n<li>Results Reporting: Present the results of your analysis using a combination of prose, tables, and figures. Ensure that your findings are clear, concise, and effectively support your hypothesis.</li>\n<li>Critical Evaluation: Conduct a critical evaluation of your analysis, highlighting any potential issues or limitations that may impact the validity or generalizability of your results. Offer thoughtful insights into how these shortcomings could be addressed or mitigated.</li>\n<li>References: Include a reference section following APA7 format, acknowledging any external sources used in your report.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By completing the Statistical Analysis Report, you will demonstrate your proficiency in data analysis, hypothesis formulation, result interpretation, and critical evaluation.
