The presentation will be done alternatively by different members of the group. This is a concise presentation (3-4 minutes) of the outcome of the practical. Being able to present concisely is an important skill that planning students should acquire and improve during this studio course - it is a very important skill to have in relation to 'Employability'. The group will get feedback from their peers and the instructor. It will be followed by a Wikipedia page to complete before the next practical. The completion of the 'pitch your idea' exercise (presentation) and the Wikipedia exercise are both compulsory to obtain the full mark of 10 for the semester. If you complete just one of the two you will receive a score of 0.5/1 for your participation mark.</p>\n<p>Feedback will be provided by the tutor or course coordinator on both the oral exercise and the Wikipedia exercise to ensure good progress on the report during the semester.

Each group will develop a regeneration plan for the next 20 years for the study area in South Brisbane located along Montague Road (see perimeter available on Blackboard, bordered by Brereton St, Cordelia St, Boundary St and the river) working within the existing planning framework set up by Brisbane City Council. In particular, the Brisbane’s inner-city strategy and the recent TLPI applying to Kurilpa Growth Precinct Area. Students will propose regeneration strategies in relation to the planning framework while taking into account the community aspirations/needs as well. Community aspirations can be grasped during a site tour on week 2 as well as through the visualisation of prerecorded interviews with community members (Available on blackboard). Students should be specific about the demographic projection for the study area based on ABS data (community profile). How many residents should be accommodated in the developed study area. In addition, students will specify the mix of dwellings in terms of price point for the new mixed-use building on Montague Road (affordable housing/social housing medium price/market price), the stakeholders involved in the development and delivery of the mixed-use building should be specified. In any case, the final regeneration plan should include housing affordability as a key component.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the regeneration plan will promote a vibrant and well-designed mixed-use strip along Montague Road that will be acceptable for the community. The redevelopment of the Visy site provides an opportunity to redevelop Montague Road in a ‘Boulevard Style’ that would result in an attractive environmental strip encouraging people to explore the whole length, with hubs of varying activities. Students will consider the connection between the two sides of Montague Road to develop a creative and sustainable precinct and promote a mix of uses (including residential development) aligned with the development outcomes specified in the TLPI for the Kurilpa Sustainable Growth Precinct and the community aspirations.</p>\n<p>The Plan is divided in two parts: Part I. Study area; Part II. Site.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
