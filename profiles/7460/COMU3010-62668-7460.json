Of course, you are encouraged to do all thirteen and we will use the result of your best ten to calculate your mark. Typically each task is made up of either multiple choice or true/false questions. These tasks help you assess your understanding of the weekly readings which are all contained in the compulsory and recommended books for this course. These tasks are designed to help you understand the lecture each week and you need to complete them before attending the lecture. The questions asked in these tasks relate to: 1) the topic of each chapter, 2) the argument made in each chapter, 3) the theories used or cited in each chapter, 4) the methods used or cited in each chapter, 5) the concepts developed in each chapter, 6) the types of data used in each chapter, and 7) the contribution of the chapter to the field of sociolinguistics. </p>\n<p><strong>Tasks open on Monday at 9am and are due by the time class starts each week.</strong></p>\n<p>Week 1, Chapter 1 of Blommaert, J.

You are then to prepare an oral review of this book. In the first class you will be randomly allocated to a presentation week and day. So that I can have a record of all presentations, our presentations are to be done during class hours via ZOOM.</p>\n<p>You need to present a fifteen minute oral review of the book you have chosen. Reviews focus on how the book adds to what we already know about topic (e.g. Does it tell us something new? Does it provide us with a new way of looking at old problems?)</p>\n<p>The marking rubric for this task presents you with a guideline on the types of things you need to cover in your review. You can use this criteria sheet to assess your own work once you think it is finished and do a practice run. Alternatively, you might like to work with another student and use the marking criteria sheet to assess and provide feedback to each other on practice runs of your presentations. Doing this will also help you further refine your review. We will also have work on this in class the week before presentations are due. If you are unsure of what the categories mean or what is entailed in doing a review, then it is recommended that you read pages 126-137 and 199-212 of Hay, I., Bochner, D., and Dungey, C. 2012. <em>Making the Grade: A Guide to Successful Communication and Study (4</em><em>th</em><em> Edition)</em>. Melbourne: Oxford University Press. If you are still unsure of the task after reading the guide, then please come and see me and/or ask in class.</p>\n<p>When you write your review please include headings covering Description, Analysis, and Evaluation. To get some idea of what a finished review looks like you might like to look at number of book reviews found in international academic journals in this field. Such journal include <em>Language in Society</em>, <em>Journal of Sociolinguistics</em>, <em>Journal of Linguistic Anthropology</em>, <em>Language and Communication</em>, <em>Signs and Society</em>. All are available online in the library.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
