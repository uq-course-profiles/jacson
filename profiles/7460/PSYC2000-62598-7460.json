This process is the first step in understanding and undertaking the research process. </p>\n<p>Students will be required to select a research topic from three options. You will be expected to read and review the literature with a critical eye. Essentially, we are keen for you to report what we know, what don't we know, and what would be useful to know, about your selected topic. Topics will be provided in tutorials and via Blackboard in the first week of tutorials.</p>\n<p>Guidance will also be provided regarding ways to critique literature in tutorials. Tutorial attendance is vital to ensure you have the necessary skills and information to write your review. Starting work on this assessment piece as early as possible in the semester, and making use of any recommended resources that your tutors highlight during tutorials or place on Blackboard, is highly recommended.</p>\n<p>1200 words(excluding reference list)</p>\n<p>You will be required to use <strong>APA 7th edition</strong> format for your literature review (resources regarding APA 7th edition referencing style and document formatting are available on the Blackboard site for the course), and your report should be fully referenced both in-text and in a reference list.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
