They are to be submitted online no later than 48 hours from the time that the test is opened. For example, the test assigned for week 3 will open Monday 5th of August 2pm and will be due <strong><em>by Wednesday 7th August 2pm</em></strong>. Quiz 4 is opened for 72 hours, taking into account the Public Holiday (07 October). Tests are set up as online quizzes. Solutions will be made available on the blackboard site after the due date, and no late submissions will be accepted without <strong>prior approval </strong>from the course coordinator. If you are unable to complete the tests within the given period you will need to apply for a deferred exam no later than 5 calendar days after the due date.</p>\n<p>The tests are not graded by the course coordinator or the tutors - they are graded automatically in blackboard. It is your responsibility to look at the answers provided. The tests are graded out of a total of questions across the semester answered correctly. These must be completed by the due dates. Each week, the number of questions will vary - some weeks might have 10 questions, others might have only 4 questions. This reflects the time needed to spend on each set of exercises. </p>\n<p>Details about the tests will be provided in week 1 of the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI use: </strong>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
