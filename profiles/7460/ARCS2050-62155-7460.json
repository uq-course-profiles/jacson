You can use the recording form provided, or create your own form (such as excel spreadsheet or notebook system).</li>\n<li>The person memorialised, their name, their age at death, their relationship to others on the memorial or in the grave, their religion, their sex, ethnicity (or country of origin), occupation, cause of death etc</li>\n<li>The year of the death</li>\n<li>The size and shape of the memorial</li>\n<li>The material that the memorial is made from</li>\n<li>Who erected and/or paid for the memorial (e.g. husband, wife, friends, workmates, public subscription etc)</li>\n<li>Any significant inscription and/or symbolism on the memorial (and your interpretation of what that symbolism means)</li>\n<li>The surface area of the memorial that relates to each specific individual (surface area is determined by measuring the length and the width of that portion of the memorial and multiplying them together). You can do this roughly - don't worry about curved edges etc.</li>\n<li>Take at least one photo of each grave and in at least one of the photos include yourself (take a selfie)</li>\n<li>Prepare and submit report that includes:</li>\n<li>A brief summary of the results (this information can be presented in tables, graphs or figures and you can select the key data that are relevant to your analysis below. Any pattern you discuss below should be reported in this results section.</li>\n<li>A discussion of two patterns you observe in the data (you<strong> don't </strong>have to use statistics to do this), for example (you can expand your analysis beyond this list):</li>\n<li>What are the ages ranges represented?. What can you say about the demographics of the area from your data (e.g. infant mortality rates)?</li>\n<li>What different materials are used at different times for memorials?</li>\n<li>Why are some memorials bigger than others?</li>\n<li>Do different symbols relate to different ethnicities, ages, sexes etc?</li>\n<li>Do different surface areas relate to ethnicities, ages, sexes etc?</li>\n<li>Are memorials built by husbands for wives more or less ornate than those built by wives for husbands etc?</li>\n<li>A discussion of which theme/s (select from the themes listed in the Week 3 lecture) best apply to your analysis and why it/these are a helpful lens for your analysis.
