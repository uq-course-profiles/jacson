As such, ten percent of your grade is attached to this assessment activity. Participation is not about making the most insightful comments or getting answers to questions right. It is about airing ideas, asking questions, and contributing to a productive classroom discussion, befitting of postgraduate study. This part of the assessment is a great opportunity for you to boost your overall grade, as students who attend all classes and always chip in with some ideas or thoughts will get full marks. If you attend all classes but never say anything, you will receive no points for this item of assessment. Conversely, if you attend all classes and always contribute, you will get the full 10 percent. The course coordinator and tutor will keep a record of who contributes. </p>\n<p>As there are 12 seminars but only 10 points awarded in total for seminar participation, students can miss two seminars without penalty. </p>\n<p>Students who are unwell or have extenuating circumstances for non-attendance can email the Course Coordinator Dr Andrew Phillips (andrew.phillips@uq.edu.au) with medical or other documentation. Make up work will be assigned in lieu by the Course Coordinator for students to be assigned marks when they cannot attend.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: Students who cannot regularly attend the 4-5:50pm Thursday time slot should reconsider their enrolment in this class.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT).
