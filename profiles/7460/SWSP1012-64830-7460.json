It is scheduled for Week 4 and comprises 20% of your course mark.</li>\n<li><strong>Assessment 2 </strong>consists of a set of group-based activities at the end of which you will submit a portfolio containing a <em>peer-reviewed conference abstract </em>on a human rights, social justice or diversity-related concern of your choice. The portfolio is due in Week 8 and comprises 30% of your course mark.</li>\n<li><strong>Assessment 3 </strong>entails the production of a <em>recorded conference presentation and PowerPoint slides</em>, based on the abstract produced for Assessment 2. In addition to the concepts tested in Assessment 1, this task also requires you to draw on concepts of agency, responsibility, and allyship for human rights, social justice and respect for diversity. This task is due to be submitted at the end of Week 13 and comprises 50% of your course mark.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be producing the conference abstract (Assessment 2) and the recorded conference presentation (Assessment 3) with reference to a <strong>fictitious student conference </strong>entitled <em>Advancing Human Rights, Social Justice, and Respect for Diversity in Australia Today. </em>At the same time, your course coordinator is part of an international group of social work lecturers who are working to organise an <strong>actual symposium </strong>where students from selected universities can share their concerns around human rights, social justice, and diversity and discuss ideas about how these might be addressed. The date of this envisaged symposium will fall within December 2024. Interested students from this class would have an <strong>opportunity to participate </strong>in this event, and updates will be provided throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>Your <strong>first assessment task </strong>is an <strong>in-class</strong>/<strong>in-person quiz </strong>is an initial task to assess your knowledge of the course material you studied during Weeks 1 to 3 of this course, that is (1) the concepts of <em>power </em>and <em>structure,</em> and (2) the concepts of <em>human rights</em>, <em>social justice</em>, and <em>diversity</em>. </p>\n<p>Your quiz is designed as a closed-book assessment and will contain 40 multiple-choice questions worth 0.5 marks each. The quiz is scheduled for Monday, 12 August 2024 at 08h00, and will need to be completed within 40 minutes (plus 10 minutes reading time). As this quiz is taken in class/in person, you must attend the lecture period during which it is scheduled to be able to complete this task. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This assessment task must be completed in person.
