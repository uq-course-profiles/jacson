Your final mark out of 10 will be calculated based on the requirements for Part 1 and Part 2.</p>\n<p>(For example, if you receive 4.25 for Part 1 and 5 for Part 2, your final mark for this assessment will be 4.25+5 = 9.25.)</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1 – Pre-class Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of the first section of this task is to prepare for class each week. From Weeks 2 to 11, you will be asked to read assigned readings and expected to listen to the online lecture before class. After completing the reading material and listening to the lecture, you will be taking a 15-minute online activity. The format of the questions will be multiple-choice, True/False, matching, filling the blank etc. The assignment will be available on our SLAT7001/2001 Blackboard site from 5 pm on Wednesdays until 7am on Mondays (before class). That means that 1) all students, irrespective of the tutorial session they are enrolled in will have five calendar days to complete each assignment, and 2) you will not be able to participate in the assignment of that week after class.</p>\n<p><strong>The 5 marks for Part A are calculated based on the average of 10 PCA scores.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 – Post-class Reflection</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of the second part of this task is to reflect on the weekly learning content after watching the video lectures, completing the readings and participating in the class activities. From Weeks 2 to 13, you will need to answer the questions in INSPERA after class.</p>\n<p>Please summarise your reflection on what you learned and how you think you may be able to apply them to your teaching/ learning context in 150-200 words. Your reflection should be thoughtful and insightful, but succinct.</p>\n<p>In your reflection, please respond to the weekly focus question (compulsory) along with some (or all) of the following questions each week.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions about course content:</strong></p>\n<p>·      What was the most important thing you learned during the class this week?</p>\n<p>·      What was something you already knew or had learned but was reinforced?</p>\n<p>·      Write down a question or query you have concerning the topic(s) discussed.</p>\n<p>·      What worked well for you in class? Please explain.</p>\n<p>·      What didn’t work well for you in class? Please explain.</p>\n<p>Additional questions that you may like to consider:</p>\n<p>·      What are your beliefs about teaching and learning?</p>\n<p>·      How have your beliefs changed? Or do you still have the same belief about teaching/learning?</p>\n<p>·      What other things should be covered in the course?</p>\n<p><strong>There are 12 Post-class reflections to complete, but you only need to complete 10 to receive the full 5 points in Part 2.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The 5 marks for Part 2 are calculated based on the average score of your best 10 responses. </strong>Please show evidence of your participation in the class activities by sharing examples in the reflection. The tutor will also check class attendance before marking. If the responses are not complete, partial marks will be deducted.</p>\n<p>This assessment will be delivered by Inspera. Inspera Assessment provides additional functionality to complement the existing suite of digital learning tools at UQ with a greater range of question types and accessibility provisions. Further details, including an introduction to Inspera functionality, practice opportunities, and where to go for support, will be provided on the Blackboard site for this course in Week 1 of the semester.</p>\n<p>If a technical failure occurs when you are submitting your assignment on Inspera (BEFORE the due date), please take clear screenshots of the issue and send them directly to the course coordinator and your instructor with an explanation of the problem. The course coordinator will advise accordingly.</p>\n<p><em>There is a make-up pre-class assignment available in Week 13, as such, extension requests are not necessary for this assessment. For the post-class reflections, you would need to attend class. If you cannot attend the tutorial session, please contact the course coordinator/instructor before the tutorial.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Al technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference Al use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of Al tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
