The majority of students will undertake a written project, but in a non-essay form, such as a website, blog, article for a news magazine or website like <em>The Conversation</em>, a government-style report, a green paper, a specialist chapter for an educational text, a short biography, a short film script, or another platform that allows you to engage with a specific audience. Some students will work with local cultural institutions, to form an exhibit or other output.</p>\n<p>Your Project is expected to integrate your primary research with judicious use of secondary literature, including scholarly books and journal articles from the field of History. It should demonstrate an awareness of the requirements of your chosen platform, some creativity in your chosen topic and research tasks, and high-quality written expression. The emphasis is on a completed historical product, ready for publication or transmission in some other form, or utilisation as an historical resource. It should be designed in a way that is appropriate for the client and/or audience that you have identified. </p>\n<p><strong>Word Limits: </strong>A final word count<strong> </strong>that is within ±10% of the set length (3500 words) is acceptable.
