The aim of the Applied Project assessment is to provide students with an opportunity to develop skills in diagnosing, planning, implementing, and evaluating organisational change interventions. The goal of the Applied Project is the generation of a comprehensive change management plan to address a current organisational challenge. This must be both theoretically based, and practically sound.</p>\n<p>As part of the Applied Project, students will have the opportunity to share their progress (e.g., preliminary diagnostic insights, initial hypotheses and plan developments) via a graded class presentation to peers with the aid of PowerPoints slides. Your presentation should be targeted to address an ‘audience group’ that you regard as most helpful for the development of your project, which could include your peers, client, or organisational change specialists. All group members must have a speaking role of some form.</p>\n<p>The primary aim of this presentation is to describe progress achieved towards your understanding of the selected organisational challenge, your methods for integrating theoretical models/frameworks into your methodology, and your preliminary thoughts about the design of a relevant organisational change management plan. Students are encouraged to use the presentation to propose any tentative ideas they are interested in receiving feedback on from their peers, prior to their incorporation into the final applied project proposal.</p>\n<p>Length:<strong> </strong>15-minute presentation delivered in class + 5 minutes of Q&amp;A</p>\n<p><em>Remember:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is expected that all group members will have a speaking role of some form. </li>\n<li>You need to email a copy of your presentation slides to the course coordinator by 4pm of the evening prior to your presentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You are also encouraged to apply feedback from your group presentation, to the development of a comprehensive and innovative approach to the organisational challenge and associated change management process.</p>\n<p>The report should give consideration to strategies and considerations for change, frameworks for implementation, and how the intervention could be evaluated. </p>\n<p>The assessment is designed to provide you with practice in developing well-justified, effective approaches to organisational development interventions, and communicating these in ways that your client will be receptive to. You may incorporate graphics, empirical literature, or self-sourced organisational data as you deem necessary. Please prepare this report assuming that your client has contracted you to produce this report independent of whether you or other professionals will facilitate delivery of the proposed change plan.</p>\n<p>You are not required to produce costings for the proposed activities, nor any detailed appendices (e.g., full communication strategy document), yet you may allude to these for the sake of completeness and provide example input.</p>\n<p>A further aim of this assessment is to develop skills in critically reviewing academic literature related to theoretical models of organisational change. This is critical competency to develop to be able to engage in evidence-based practice of organisational change management. Development of the ‘Critical Review’ will inform your consultancy’s preferred theoretical perspective, which can then be applied to the development of the ‘Organisational Change Management Plan’.</p>\n<p>To achieve this aim, students are required to develop an academically formatted ‘Critical Review of Organisational Change Model(s)/Framework(s)’ submitted as additional support of the ‘Organisational Change Plan’. You are only required to review the potential utility, (evidential) validity, and practical relevance of only the theoretical models that have informed your development of the ‘Organisational Change Plan’. The ‘Critical Review’ should be written in a form of a critical essay directed towards an intelligent lay audience familiar with principles of research and academic literature (e.g., course staff). Clients would not normally be privy to such documentation and, as such, you may not assume any prior theoretical knowledge of ‘Critical Review’ content in your ‘Organisational Change Management Plan’ (all relevant theoretical concepts must be re-defined in lay terminology).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Word count:<strong> </strong>3000 word maximum (excluding tables and figures) for organisational change report plus 500 words maximum (excluding references) for the critical review. The word count must be stated on title page of the submitted report.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
