One of the most important reasons for taking you to Stradbroke Island was for you to experience this for yourself in the context of the arguments for and against sand mining. This assessment has been designed to develop your ability to think critically about both sides of a complex conservation issue and to construct a fair and well-reasoned response to a challenging debate. Such a response is based on evidence and argument, rather than an emotional or intuitive reaction to the controversy.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Instructions - What You Will Be Doing</strong></p>\n<p>As explained below, this assessment task will include both a spoken and written component. The exercise will take the form of a brief, small-group discussion involving yourself, Berndt, John and one other student. This discussion will take place on campus in the days after our return from Stradbroke Island, and each student will need to make their own appointment to see Berndt and John during this time. The exact dates and times for these interviews, and instructions on how to reserve your appointment, will be explained during class. </p>\n<p><em>This assessment will take the form of a role-playing scenario…</em></p>\n<p>From the end of 2019, the long history of sand mining on Stradbroke Island officially came to an end. But for the purposes of this assessment, <strong>imagine that there has been a change in the Government of Queensland, and that the mining company has lodged a formal request to the new government to recommence sand-mining on Stradbroke Island.</strong> This request will be considered by the new minister for conservation and sustainable development. In the role-playing discussion that you will be participating in, the part of this minister will be played by Berndt, and John will take the role of his (long-suffering?) ministerial aide! </p>\n<p><em>You will take the part of an informed expert…</em></p>\n<p>Your role in this scenario will be as an expert advisor, who has been invited to a meeting with the minister to offer your advice on the government's Stradbroke Island policy. Specifically, you have been asked to offer your informed opinion on this question <strong>\"should sand-mining be allowed to continue on Stradbroke island?\"</strong></p>\n<p>You were asked to provide your input because the minister knows that you have conducted extensive fieldwork on Stradbroke island, investigating post-mining rehabilitation success (using ants as bioindicators, and surveys of vegetation diversity and structure). He is also aware that you have earned a reputation among the Stradbroke Island community as a fair and unbiased observer who has developed a strong understanding of the broader ecological, socio-economic and indigenous issues surrounding the sand-mining debate.  </p>\n<p><em>Choose your position…</em></p>\n<p><strong>Half the class will be arguing in favour of the proposition that sand mining should be allowed to return to Stradbroke Island, and the other half against.</strong>  Hence, you must identify whether you will be arguing either for or against the proposal at the outset of assessment task (we will do our best to give everyone their first preference of position in the debate, but because the class does need to be split half-half on this, please appreciate that some flexibility may be required). You may argue for your broad position in any way that you wish, as long as your conclusions are backed by evidence and a well-reas</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
