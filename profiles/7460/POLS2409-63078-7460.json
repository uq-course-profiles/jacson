During Week 1 the class will be provided with a list of approximately 70 terms that are crucial to understanding the course, organized by week.</p>\n<p>Each week I will select 3 terms that were covered during the previous week's lecture. During the lecture, you will be given 12 minutes to write a definition of one of the three terms I have selected from this list and displayed on the screen. <em>Please note that the time the quiz is offered will vary from week to week, but that it will occur at some stage during the scheduled lecture time depending on that week's structure. </em></p>\n<p>The definition has two parts: part A asks you to define the term. Part B asks you to explain why this term is important within the wider context of the twentieth century and/or the study of international relations. Examples will be provided in class and on Blackboard. Part A is worth 1 mark, part B is worth 3 marks (4 marks total). </p>\n<p>There are <strong>10 (ten)</strong>  opportunities to take the quiz, but you only need to do it<strong> 7 (seven) </strong>times, forming 28% of your grade.  If you do more than 7 quizzes, we will select your top 7 results. This means that you can miss up to three quizzes without a penalty. <em>Please note that there are </em><strong>NO</strong> <em>opportunities to re-take individual quizzes and no alternative assessment available except in the very specific circumstances outlined below. </em>In other words: be organized and try to take as many quizzes as early as you can! If you do more than 7 quizzes, you can seriously improve your grade as we will take your top results. Also note that the last quiz is held in week 11 and plan accordingly!</p>\n<p>Each week I will run through the definition from the previous week and provide examples of what constituted excellent work. As these terms are crucial components of the history of the twentieth century and the study of that century, I will be able to use your knowledge to enhance class discussion and overall learning in the course. The final exam for the course has a definitions component, so by doing this activity weekly and discussing the definitions during each lecture you will also enhance your performance on the final exam. </p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a Disability Action Plan that applies to the quiz please contact your tutor or the lecturer ASAP. We can make accommodations in the lecture for many of the issues documented in Disability Action Plans (e.g., if you cannot handwrite exams).</p>\n<p>If a student has a genuine (documented) reason they have been unable to attend the lecture on 7 occasions, a make up test will be offered late in the semester, using the same master list of definitions. There is already flexibility built into this assessment to miss up to three quizzes, so the make-up quiz does not apply to students who miss up to three lectures for illness, etc. The make-up quiz is <em>only </em>available to students who have a genuine, documented reason for missing more than three lectures. Reasons may include: work commitments that cannot be altered; sudden/serious illness that requires a lengthy absence; or another documented reason for a lengthy absence.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for alternative assessment, you must contact me by <strong>FRIDAY 16 AUGUST</strong> with your documentation. If there is an unforeseeable change to your circumstances (eg illness, new job) after that date, please contact me as soon as you can with documentation.</p>\n<p>There will be <em>one</em> make -up test offered and I will give plenty of notice of the date.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

(you do not need to worry about any problems relating to the space/time continuum or what happens if you remove objects or people). NB sadly you have no powers of assassination for this mission so you cannot simply remove a person. You also cannot perform an action that has the equivalent impact of removing a person (i.e., engineering an election so someone loses). The error should be an error of world politics, not domestic politics. You should choose one error/aspect of an error only; e.g., don't correct the entire peace settlement in 1919, but choose the aspect you think was the most significant error. If in doubt ask in the lecture or tutorial. </p>\n<p>*You may be thinking: what does most significant mean? It means the most consequential error: an error that had far-reaching consequences for world politics.</p>\n<p>Your assignment will consist of:</p>\n<p>-         Explaining why you consider this error to be so significant – why did you choose it?</p>\n<p>-         What led the players involved to make this mistake?</p>\n<p>-         Explaining how you would correct the error – what would have to happen for the error to go away?</p>\n<p>-         Outlining the best-case scenario for what would happen after your correction.</p>\n<p>-         Outlining the worst-case scenario for what would happen after your correction.</p>\n<p>You will write this assignment <strong><em>as an essay</em> </strong>that consists of five parts (those outlined above). You have 2000 words to divide up among these 5 parts. You will have to use your judgment to decide how many words each section needs to be (it will vary according to your choices). Writing this essay successfully will require research, just as you would do in a normal essay. You will need to do research for all five of the parts of the essay (to varying degrees) and use reference material and referencing just as you would in any essay. More information about this assignment will be provided in lectures, tutorials and on blackboard.</p>\n<p>Assignments should be typed (double-spaced), fully referenced, and include a reference list. The reference list is not included in the word count. Students are expected to use the referencing style outlined in the School of Political Science and International Studies Essay Guide.</p>\n<p>All assignments submitted are to be the original and individual work of the student submitting them. The assignment must be submitted electronically though Turnitin in Word.doc format (not PDF).  </p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
