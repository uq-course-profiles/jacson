The main function of the sign is to convey information about the site and its significance, ensure it is jargon free with the interpretative text accessible to a year level 9 education. Quality on-site interpretations do not contain too many words as quite often a visitor to a prominent archaeological site will not spend too much time reading large amounts of text. </p>\n<p>Your sign content should be considered as a “frame” that facilitates reading and interpreting the archaeological site within its landscape setting.
