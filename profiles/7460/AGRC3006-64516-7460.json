Using the Pastures Australia Selection Tool (<a href=\"https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/pastures/index.htm\">https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/pastures/index.htm</a>) make a recommendation on what would be a suitable pasture mix for planting, from a suitability and productivity perspective. The pasture mix should contain two pasture grasses and two legumes.</p>\n<p>Consider the following parameters associated with the location and characteristics of the paddock:</p>\n<p>·        Select Queensland then the Fitzroy region in the Pastures Australia Selection Tool.</p>\n<p>·        Medium term pasture (3-5 years)</p>\n<p>·        Rainfall – 560 mm</p>\n<p>·        Soil texture – Medium (Loam, clay loam)</p>\n<p>·        Soil pH – Alkaline (&gt; 7.5)</p>\n<p>·        Soil drainage – Well drained</p>\n<p>·        Level of soil salinity – Low (0-2 dS/m)</p>\n<p>In your response,</p>\n<p>·        Include the objective of the exercise and summarise in your own word’s information about the location and specifics of the paddock.</p>\n<p>·        List all the grasses and legumes that were identified as suitable using the Pastures Australia Selection Tool.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note that in the Pastures Australia Selection Tool the recommended species highlighted in green are considered most favourable followed by those in orange.</strong></p>\n<p>·        From the above list, recommend two pasture grasses and two legumes to plant as a mixture in the pasture.</p>\n<p>·        Discuss the respective attributes of the selected pasture species that make them most suitable for this situation (e.g. ease of establishment, nutritional quality, grazing tolerance etc).</p>\n<p>·        The fact sheets in the Tropical Forages database are a good source of specific information on individual pasture species. </p>\n<p><strong>Please note: This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

If possible, external students are welcome to attend the sampling practical. Data from the practical will be provided to all students via Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Method</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to work in small groups to estimate the yield and botanical composition of a pasture using different sampling methods. Specifically, you are required to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sample approximately 20 quadrats (50 cm x 50 cm) per group over the paddock to measure yield and botanical composition using various methods. Use a systematic grid pattern to locate the position of the quadrats. For each quadrat, note the yield score (1-10), rising plate meter measurement, the % of each component by dry weight, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dominant species if 3 species are present.</li>\n<li>Determine yield by the visual scoring method. Yield of the pasture can be measured by a visual scoring technique where each of the quadrats is scored between 1 and 10 (1 = lowest yield and 10 = highest yield in the paddock). To calibrate your yield scores, you need to select at least three reference quadrats against which all other quadrats are compared. You should locate the lowest yield in the paddock and give that pasture a yield score of 1 (note: bare ground is equivalent to a yield score of 0). Conversely, locate the highest yield in the paddock and give that pasture a yield score of 10. You should also locate a medium yield location and give a score of 4, 5 or 6 depending on its relative yield compared to the 1 and 10 scores. <strong>Spending time calibrating visual scores as a group is essential for accurate and consistent results.</strong></li>\n<li>Determine yield by the rising plate meter method. Rising plate meters can quickly estimate pasture yield by measuring the height of pasture under the weight of a standard plate (usually 4kg/m2).</li>\n<li>At the end of the sampling exercise, each group will provide yield scores and RPM measurements (only one group) for 10 quadrats that have been located to give a spread of scores from 1 to 10. These quadrats will then be cut to a standard height of 5 cm above ground level, with the herbage from each quadrat to be placed in individual bags.</li>\n<li>Place the paper bags in an oven and dry at 65oC for 48 hours. Weigh each bag, subtracting the weight of the packet so that you have a dry weight, yield score and a rising plate meter measurement for each of the hand-cut quadrats.</li>\n<li>All the data will be combined and provided to all students to undertake calculations of pasture yield, composition and stocking rates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Calculations</strong></p>\n<p>Calculations will be discussed in class and will include (a) Determining whether enough samples (i.e. quadrats) were taken to accurately measure the yield of pasture using both the visual score and rising plate methods, (b) quantifying and comparing the yield and botanical composition of the pastures using two techniques, and (3) determining the carrying capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Report submission</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Report requirements will be discussed in class but require the following sections - Introduction, Adequacy of the sampling regime, Calibration graphs and equations, Mean dry matter yield of the pasture, Botanical composition, Carrying capacity, Conclusion, References.</li>\n<li>Word Length should not exceed 2000 words exclusive of references, graphs, tables and figures. For all references (recommend using APA 7th referencing style), provide a reference list at the end of your report. No marks will be given for copied materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note: This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
