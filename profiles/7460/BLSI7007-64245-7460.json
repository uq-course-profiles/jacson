Rather than just learning about service design, you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learnt to a real service design challenge. To accomplish this you will complete two linked assessment tasks: (1) a Project Brief, and (2) a Design Portfolio.</p>\n<p>The first assessment task requires you to develop a 1,500-2,000 word project brief for a service design project. You should identify a service problem, challenge or opportunity related to your work or personal/family life. Contexts that may provide you with ideas include your workplace, service encounters you have experienced in retail or hospitality settings, your child’s school or extracurricular activities such as a sports team, your gym, a public service/community organisation where you volunteer, etc. Your project brief should include the purpose, scope, goals, context, key stakeholders, resources, timelines and deliverables for the project.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You will then use ideation, prototyping and testing techniques to design a service innovation to address the problem.</p>\n<p>Good design involves an on-going process of documentation and reflection about the process, content, and context of the design. Throughout the process you will develop a <strong>design portfolio</strong> based on your application of service design thinking tools and techniques to define, analyse and develop creative solutions for a service problem. Your portfolio can include a range of tools and media generated at each phase of the design process, including notes, sketches, photos, mood boards, videos, design ideas, storyboards, wireframes, worksheets, design activity plans, prototypes, etc.</p>\n<p>Your portfolio should be organised around the six phases of the service design process, including research, problem identification, ideation, prototyping and testing. The final stage should be presented as a plan for implementing the service innovation. Each phase of the design process should be accompanied by a short (200 to 300 word) <strong>reflection</strong> of the process – what did you do, what worked, what did not work, what did you learn?</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
