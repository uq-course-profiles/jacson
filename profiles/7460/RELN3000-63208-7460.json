For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write a government report. E.g.,<br/>\n<ol>\n<li>The federal government is seeking submissions on the future of the School chaplaincy program. Write a submission arguing for or against it.</li>\n<li>The state government is considering removing faith-based Religious education programs in primary schools. Write a submission arguing for or against this decision.</li>\n<li>Write a report for the state government on the significance of religion for the well-being of a particular diasporic community.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Produce an audio-visual documentary (min 5 mins, with scholarly script of approx. 800 words) or podcast. Examples can be found on Blackboard. E.g.,<br/>\n<ol>\n<li>Pauline Hanson attained electoral success partially through some strong views regarding Muslims. Canvas the views of Brisbane's religious leaders regarding her arguments. Alternatively, interview Muslims regarding the impact of her public pronouncements on their lives.</li>\n<li>Are churches in decline? Seek the views of a range of church leaders. What role do they see churches having into the future?</li>\n<li>Brisbane has many mosques, gurudwaras, synagogues, Hindu temples and Buddhist institutions. Who uses them and why?</li>\n<li>A day in the life of a person who has chosen a religious vocation.</li>\n<li>Explore the visual language of a religious building (or a number of religious buildings).</li>\n<li>Explain arguments relevant to religious doctrines or an event (historical or contemporary) relevant to religion. </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Write an editorial piece for a newspaper or an article for the Conversation (http://theconversation.com/au) on a current issue in the media involving religion</li>\n<li>Write an article for a music magazine (e.g., Rolling Stone, Rhythms Magazine) focussing on music with religious themes. This does not have to be (but could be) 'religious' music as such. </li>\n<li>Choose five religiously themed art pieces or museum objects from a gallery or museum in Brisbane and write a floor talk for a curator explaining their significance<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, do something similar as a short documentary</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Write a submission for a hypothetical legal case involving a religious issue. E.g.,<br/>\n<ol>\n<li>Is the federal government's School Chaplaincy program in breach of section 116 of the Constitution of Australia?</li>\n<li>Identify a behaviour that brings the 'free exercise of any religion' provisions in section 116 of the Constitution into conflict with another area of law. Write a submission that argues either that the behaviour should be permitted, or that it should not.</li>\n<li>You have been asked by a defendant's legal team to write a submission giving context to the action of the defendant that was in accord with his or her religious convictions but against Australian law. </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sky is the limit for this assessment piece. In 2019, one student invented a board game based on René Girard's theories about violence and the sacred.
