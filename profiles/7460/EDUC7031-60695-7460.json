This assessment task is natural, as teaching will be the main responsibility of students in the post-study TESOL career. Students will also have a great opportunity to learn from their peers’ presentations.</p>\n<p>The presentation will focus on only small aspects of the topic for the week. For example, related to the weekly topic of Reading, student presentations may prioritise techniques and strategies of reading or stages of reading, or how to deal with new words while reading, or reading on paper or on screen, or goals of reading etc.</p>\n<p>Each presentation will be 20 minutes. Some students will present in their tutorial group in real time, whether in the face-to-face classroom or on zoom, while other students will video record and upload it to the blackboard. The video recording must show the presenter as well as power point slides or any other materials that may be used.</p>\n<p>The presentations will start from Week 6. Students will be notified the presentation schedule by Week 4. The additional tutorial hour in the first four weeks of the course will prepare students for the presentation and other assessment tasks.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In this project you will design, develop, teach (imagine) and justify a segment of a TESOL program or syllabus for a group of students for whom you are or might be responsible. Your unit design should consist of <strong>at least 4</strong> lessons but should not exceed <strong>6 lessons in total</strong>.  Programs may be based on classes you have taught recently or classes that could be taught in EFL contexts, ELICOS, Migrant Education, schools (Pre, Primary, Secondary), or classes you’d like to teach, etc. either in Australia or overseas.</p>\n<p>In designing your curriculum, you should address the following:</p>\n<p>Part A.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The environment for your course, considering the nature of the learners, the teachers and the teaching situation</li>\n<li>The learner group and their specific language learning needs.</li>\n<li>The principles of language teaching and learning used to guide your design.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part B.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The goals of your unit</li>\n<li>Summary content and sequencing of a series of lessons</li>\n<li>Materials used for learning</li>\n<li>Assessment of learning, both formative and summative</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part C</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reflective justification of your design, drawing clear connections between part A and Part B. In this section you should argue the relevance of your curriculum design for the teaching situation and the needs of the learner group. The choices that you make in relation to goals, content, materials and assessment processes should be clearly justified in relation to research-informed theories of language teaching and learning. You should draw on course readings and current relevant literature to support your justification.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that your curriculum design project <strong>should not be based on an existing English language course book</strong>.  APA referencing must be used. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
