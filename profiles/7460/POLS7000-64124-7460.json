In turn, the nation has a specific history that we can trace, just as we can also trace the different ways in which nation and state have come together. Until the middle of the twentieth century the sovereign state coexisted with empire: sovereignty in the centre and empire in the periphery. Thus, is it relatively recently that this ordering of political authority collapsed, with the end of formal empire. While this change brought about recognition of the rights of colonised peoples, recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples took longer.

            "topic_description": "Sovereignty, decolonisation and indigenous rights Seminar time: Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:00 pm In discussions of politics the state and the nation can be taken for granted but they are, historically speaking, relatively recent developments and the territorial sovereign state should be understood as a particular institutional configuration of political authority, one that has been very successful (at least to date). In turn, the nation has a specific history that we can trace, just as we can also trace the different ways in which nation and state have come together. Until the middle of the twentieth century the sovereign state coexisted with empire: sovereignty in the centre and empire in the periphery. Thus, is it relatively recently that this ordering of political authority collapsed, with the end of formal empire. While this change brought about recognition of the rights of colonised peoples, recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples took longer. Thus, this week we apply some of the concepts we have been studying, particularly legitimacy, power, institutions and sovereignty as we consider decolonisation and the rights of indigenous peoples.",
