You will need to review relevant research studies on your selected topic to provide an adequate justification for the research. This is not an annotated bibliography; your aim should be to critically review the studies, synthesize the findings and draw on these findings to make a case for the proposed topic. This literature review can be used to help inform Assignment 2.  Performing this first assessment task successfully will require you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify clearly the research problem/topic/issue that you are proposing to investigate;</li>\n<li>Review and synthesize relevant, timely and substantive studies; and</li>\n<li>Identity a ‘gap’ - an under-researched area - in the literature to provide justification for the research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The review should focus on relevant and up-to-date research on the topic. Although a fixed format for the assessment task is not prescribed, it is expected that there will be:</p>\n<p>      * an introduction about the nature of the topic; </p>\n<p>      * a body where the studies will be reviewed and;</p>\n<p>      * a conclusion where justification for the 'gap' in the topic will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Length: </strong>2000 words</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
