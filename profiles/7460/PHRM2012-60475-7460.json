Community Placement (HURDLE Assessment)</strong></p>\n<p>The Community Pharmacy Placement is a compulsory component of PHRM2012. Students will complete a total of minimum 20 hours (maximum 25) of Community Placement over 4-5 weeks. Community Pharmacy Placement Site allocations are nominated by students and subsequently approved by the Placements Team in InPlace. Students must check in InPlace to see if their Community Pharmacy Placement Site has been approved before they can attend their nominated Community Pharmacy Placement Site. Students MUST meet the following three requirements to PASS PHRM2012. However, only the 5 Reflective Task will provide 20% weight of the Course grade.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Planned Placement Attendance: </strong>The planned placement attendance MUST be completed BEFORE the compulsory Community Pharmacy Placement can commence. For health and safety reasons, you MUST NOT start your placement until you have submitted your completed pre-placement forms so that they can be cleared/approved by the School's Placement Team.</li>\n<li><strong>Placement Evaluation (Work based assessment):</strong> At the end of the placement, the student MUST initiate the evaluation process by uploading a scanned copy of their completed formative Student Progress and Assessment (SPA) form containing the Preceptor's feedback to the ePortfolio. Following the initiation, the Preceptor will confirm the placement attendance and provide a summative evaluation of the placement performance in an electronic SPA form.</li>\n<li><strong>Five (5) Reflective Tasks (Professional Development Log): </strong>This requirement weighs 20% of the Course grade. These tasks include individual student's experiential learning in the context of National Competency Standards (3 tasks), Lifelong Learning (1 task) and Employability (1 task). Each reflection MUST NOT exceed 500 words. Student will record all Five (5) Reflective Tasks on their individual Placement experience using the SEAL model of reflection. The SEAL model Marking Criteria is closely aligned with the SEAL model. The Five (5) reflections will be marked together (cumulatively) as the Student demonstrates progression of their reflective skills throughout the Placement. See Blackboard for more details.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>The final decision regarding the overall Pass or Fail mark, as well as any additional/supplementary tasks, for this assessment component of the course will be made by the Course Coordinator (sometimes in discussion with the Preceptor).</em></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>B. Hospital Placement (HURDLE Assessment)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hospital Placement Completion: </strong>The Hospital Placement consists of EIGHT online modules of varying duration consisting of specific learning tasks that require submission of responses using links provided.
