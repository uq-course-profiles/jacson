With a human right to education and strategies that have an empirical basis, it is critical that such students are provided with interventions and strategies that are effective in decreasing the use of challenging behaviours and improving their quality of life.</p>\n<p>You will need to:</p>\n<p>1.    Read this helpful blog on Concept Mapping: https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learning-co-op/effective-studying/concept-mapping/ - :~:text=To make a concept map,read and not overly complex. </p>\n<p>2.    Make a choice of how you want to complete your Concept Map. You can either:</p>\n<p>a.    Draw your Concept Map using pen and paper. When complete, you will take a photo; or</p>\n<p>b.    Write your concepts on post-it notes and move these around on a table or board. Again, when complete, take a photo; or</p>\n<p>c.    Complete an electronic concept map. In class, we will show you one program called MindMup <a href=\"https://www.mindmup.com/\">https://www.mindmup.com/</a>  It is free to use. If you choose to use it, here are some tutorials to get you started: <a href=\"https://www.mindmup.com/tutorials/index.html\">https://www.mindmup.com/tutorials/index.html</a>  </p>\n<p>3.    Conduct a broad literature search and review peer-reviewed research literature in relation to the meaning of “<em>student quality of life</em>”, for school-aged students. When you investigate this, you need to look at student quality of life broadly (beyond school) as well as their educational quality of life (at school). </p>\n<p>4.    Conduct a second, more narrow literature search and review peer-reviewed research literature in relation to the <em>specific challenges</em> faced at school by one of the following group of students. You can, if desired, narrow this search to a particular age or year level, such as early childhood, primary or high school. You are then required to show how student quality of life can be strengthened (think about changes to systems, environments, practices). Your choice of student groups you can focus on include:</p>\n<p>·      Student with intellectual or cognitive disabilities</p>\n<p>·      Autistic students</p>\n<p>·      Students with a sensory disability impacting vision or hearing</p>\n<p>·      Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) students</p>\n<p>·      Students from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds</p>\n<p>·      Gifted and talented students</p>\n<p>·      Other students, by negotiation with the Course Co-ordinator</p>\n<p>5.    You may present a broad concept map that explores quality of life across multiple domains, or a deeper concept map that examines quality of life across one targeted domain. Your decision will be guided by the literature you identify through your search. If you exceed the 1,000-word limit, you may need to narrow your focus. </p>\n<p>6.    Present your findings as a concept map (see example below) showing how student quality of life can be strengthened your selected group of students by addressing the challenges they experience at school. We will discuss concept mapping at the Week 1 Lecture. The total word limit for your concept map should be 1000 words, with a margin of 1,100 words maximum.</p>\n<p>7.    Copy and paste either your photo or an image of your electronic concept map into a Word Document.</p>\n<p>8.    Below the image, provide a reference list using APA referencing style. The reference list will not contribute to your word limit.</p>\n<p>9.    Read the criteria sheet to ensure you have addressed all criteria. </p>\n<p>10. Upload your completed word document to Blackboard for grading before the due date.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
