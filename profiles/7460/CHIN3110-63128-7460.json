Then think about a possible solution or solutions. Remember to keep your audience in mind when you select your topic.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Organize your speech.</em></strong>  One possible way to organize your speech would be to do the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>o   Introduction<strong><em> –</em></strong> describe the issue or problem and why you think it is serious</p>\n<p>o   Body – Offer effective <strong>solutions</strong>.  Also, incorporate counterarguments.  State reasons why people may not agree with you, then provide reasons why your solution/s is/are better.  <strong>The bulk of your speech (the body) needs to be on developing your solutions, not on developing the issue/problem.</strong></p>\n<p>o   Conclusion – impress the audience to accept your solutions or to take action</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>You may use a PowerPoint presentation for this speech. If you are using it, include only key words or phrases on the slides, not sentences from your script. </em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Use sources to support your position/opinion/solution. </em></strong>Cite your source (author, year) in your speech. </li>\n<li><strong><em>Use vocabularies and grammatical structures we have learned in the class.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Practice your speech.</em></strong>  Your time limit is 10 minutes.  Make sure you stay within this timeframe.</li>\n<li><strong><em>On the day of your presentation, upload your script to Blackboard </em></strong><em>(</em>Assessment- Persuasive Speech-Presentation script)<strong><em>. </em></strong>The script needs to have both characters and pinyin. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
