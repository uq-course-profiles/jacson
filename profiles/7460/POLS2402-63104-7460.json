Liberals have since the eighteenth century exalted the benefits of 'free trade', based on the principle of 'comparative advantage', while mercantilists sought to harness trade instrumentally towards national development. But are these perspectives still relevant in a globalised economy? One of the most distinctive aspects of economic globalisation since the late 1970s has been the emergence and spread of complex cross-border 'value chains', whereby different aspects and stages of the production of goods, and even some services, happen in multiple countries and jurisdictions.

To answer this question, we need to understand the remarkable rise of global finance under globalisation - the topic of this week's lecture.

The growth of financial markets has facilitated the availability of plentiful, and relatively cheap, credit to consumers, companies and governments. The result is a rapidly growing mountain of household and sovereign debt. The encroachment of finance and financial products into increasing aspects of life is often called 'financialisation'. An example is the increasing reliance of Australian workers on consumer credit to finance their daily needs (credit cards), and their retirement (superannuation), not to mention their homes (mortgage). Governments are also increasingly financialised as their borrowing is shaped by bond markets, as are corporations whose value, and even very existence, is often shaped by dynamics on financial markets. This is not to even mention transactions in currency exchange markets, which amount to trillions daily. Why has global finance grown so fast over the past few decades? Was it inevitable?

In this week's lecture, we will examine some of the main explanations for capitalist crises and how to address them.

Cycles of boom and bust have been a constant feature of capitalist economies since their emergence in the late 18th, early 19th centuries. As Reinhart and Rogoff argue, however, every time contemporaries thought 'this time it would be different', only to be confounded. In recent years, the frequency, severity and geographical scope of capitalist crises appears to be increasing, culminating over the past 15 years or so in the GFC, Eurozone crisis, and the COVID19 downturn, which could herald a sustained economic depression. Just why crises happen in capitalist economies and what, if anything, could be done to avoid or ameliorate them is debated widely. In this week's lecture, we will examine some of the main explanations for capitalist crises and how to address them. Are we destined to live through perennial cycles of 'creative destruction', as Schumpeter called them, which destroy productive capacities and dislocate communities, or are there possible alternatives, within or beyond capitalism?",
