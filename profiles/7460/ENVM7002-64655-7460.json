Students should select the area based on their interests and the availability of information about the area. Using a combination of scientific articles and grey literature, describe the marine ecosystem, it's main ecosystem services, the stressor impacting the ecosystem, and the types of impacts the stressor is causing.</p>\n<p>Students should first research on:</p>\n<p>A. The biophysical characteristics of the ecosystem. That includes the biological and physical characteristics of the ecosystem and the ecological condition of the ecosystem, and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to stressors.</p>\n<p>B. The anthropogenic stressor (i.e., the human activity). This should include the trends in frequency and magnitude of the activity, and drivers of the stressor (e.g., economic value of the industry, food security, etc.) </p>\n<p>C. Impacts. A description of the consequence of the activity for the ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Understanding these three aspects will allow students to evaluate the risk certain stressors pose to a given ecosystem.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ASSESSMENT: </strong>Design a poster or infographic describing the impact of the stressor on the ecosystem. </p>\n<p>The poster/infographic should contain information from each of the elements laid out above (i.e., ecosystem, stressor, and impact). </p>\n<p>A poster template will be available on Blackboard. Your poster must be \"stand-alone\", i.e. understandable by an audience without attending a presentation or referring to supplementary material. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
