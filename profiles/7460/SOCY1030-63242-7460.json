Following the presentation of their video, each group will facilitate a 10-minute activity to support student learning.</p>\n<p>In videos, groups should demonstrate:</p>\n<p>·      their applied and critical understanding of the theory and concepts;</p>\n<p>·      the sociological/anthropological relevance and origins of the concepts;</p>\n<p>·      how the theory and concepts help us to understand the social determinants of health (in terms of class, gender, race and ethnicity).</p>\n<p>Videos should be thoughtful, engaging and original (going beyond what is presented in lectures). Said another way, they should not copy and paste content from the lecture; they should be original showing application beyond the examples provided in the course materials.</p>\n<p>To create the 5-minute videos, students can use whatever platform they are comfortable with. Adobe Premiere Rush is one platform available to UQ staff and students, sufficiently sophisticated, and relatively user friendly. This and others will be presented to students in a section 1 lecture (follow this link for details on video editing platforms/training available at UQ: <a href=\"https://uq.pressbooks.pub/digital-essentials-choose-the-right-tool/chapter/image-video-and-audio-tools/#video\">https://uq.pressbooks.pub/digital-essentials-choose-the-right-tool/chapter/image-video-and-audio-tools/#video</a>).</p>\n<p>In tutorial activities, students will be assessed on the quality of engagement fostered. These activities are up to you, but might include a case study reflection, interactive quiz or group media analysis task. Student-led tutorial activities will be recorded on the day, allowing the tutor to review the recording prior to finalising their mark and feedback. The recordings will be uploaded to a secure share folder for the course that will be deleted after 12 months.</p>\n<p>Peer- &amp; Self-Assessment through ‘Buddy check’: before (week 4) and following submission, students will be asked to complete a peer and self-assessment using the Buddy Check platform (link will be available through the assessments folder on Blackboard) that will be used to pro-rate a portion of the marks for this group assessment.</p>\n<p>See the course study guide for the suggested process.</p>\n<p>In the week 1 lecture, students voted to have ALL videos due at the end of week 5. </p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task (e.g., supporting the visualisation of the theory/concepts).

Building on the questions posed on page 3, the task sheet provided here is designed to help you in developing and structuring your report.</p>\n<p>For this assignment, students are encouraged to develop a topic statement (similar to an argument or thesis statement) reflecting their overall recommendation for addressing their selected health issue. This topic statement should draw on your description and theory-informed analysis of the health issue and it’s social, cultural and environmental determinants. It is recommended that your introduction include a topic statement and signposting.

Theory <em>x</em> is then applied to show ______, supporting a recommendation that <em>z</em>.</p>\n<p>Each body paragraph should have a clear focus, with a topic sentence at the beginning and transitions between paragraphs that help them to link together.
