Focused discussion, whether as a whole class or in small groups, is intended to stimulate critical thinking about the ideas presented in readings and other course material, and to facilitate the exchange of perspectives through which students can deepen their understanding of peacebuilding.</p>\n<p>Your active, informed participation is essential. You should prepare by completing <em>all</em> the required reading. You are also expected to read more widely, developing your own areas of particular peacebuilding interest, and following relevant current affairs.</p>\n<p>Marks will not be awarded for attendance alone, nor for the frequency of contribution. You should attend seminars prepared to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Answer each module's question(s);</li>\n<li>Critique or defend particular readings;</li>\n<li>Reflect on any unexpected insights, or ‘surprises’, you encounter in the reading;</li>\n<li>Draw connections with previous modules' reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prepare adequately, practice active reading. Begin by reviewing the module’s question and think about how you would answer it based on what you already know. Then skim each reading: what does it cover? What questions do you hope it will answer? Next, read the introduction and conclusion of each article, and identify what it argues and how it relates to the other readings. Finally, read the whole text of each article: what evidence does it present to support its argument(s)? What points do you agree and disagree with? What are you surprised by? </p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT).

Students can choose to analyse a range of initiatives implemented (e.g. a UN peace operation mandate), or choose to focus on one specific domain (e.g., SSR, justice, or economic recovery).</li>\n<li><strong>Critically evaluate the peacebuilding initiative(s)</strong>. What was the impact of the initiative, and why? Students should consider questions such as: What was the theory of change that underpinned the peacebuilding initiative? Was this appropriate for the context? What dilemmas or challenges did peacebuilding actors encounter in implementing the initiative(s)? Were these appropriately considered and addressed? What lessons can be learned from the case study? Factors you might focus on include (but aren't limited to): local ownership, inclusivity of marginalized groups, and effectiveness of international support.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide recommendations for improving peacebuilding practice: </strong>Based on your analysis, propose strategic recommendations for improving peacebuilding practice and enhancing sustainable peace in the context/case. Justify your recommendations with reference to lessons learned from the case study and relevant peacebuilding literature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
