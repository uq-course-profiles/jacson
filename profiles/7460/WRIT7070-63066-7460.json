Each report will differ depending on the manuscript you've chosen and your individual preferences and assessment. In writing up your report, however, you should aim to provide concise, comprehensive and constructive advice to the author. The report should offer specific suggestions (where appropriate), adopt a supportive tone, and list the strengths of the work as well as its weaknesses. Naturally, you should express yourself lucidly and carefully proofread your work so that it is mechanically flawless. High-achieving reports usually share some similar features: they are thoughtful, consistent and ultimately helpful to the author. Tip: grade one or more of the sample structural reports on Blackboard using the criteria sheet. Where can you do better? Which aspects of good practice can you learn?</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
