The written 'Literature Search + Review' assessment you submit earlier in the semester (due Week 9) will provide the foundational research for the group project. In the Weeks 10, 11, and 12 tutorials, you will bring together your knowledge from the 'Literature Search + Review' assessment along with what you have learned in your lectures throughout the semester to discuss ideas and work with your group members on the group project with tutor feedback in class. In the Week 13 tutorials, you will present the evidence-based solution or recommendation that you have designed with your group members. Thus, TUTORIAL ATTENDANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. Missing your allocated tutorial session in Weeks 10, 11, 12, and/or 13 will adversely impact your marks for this assignment. Please plan accordingly and sign onto a tutorial session which you can consistently attend throughout the semester, but especially in Weeks 10, 11, 12, and 13. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Please note that we will have measures in place to ensure that each group member contributes effectively to the group project.
