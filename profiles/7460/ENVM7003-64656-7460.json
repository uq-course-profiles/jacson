The presentation should captivate the audience. The accompanying research brief should summarise the overall research project (points 1-7 above) and should be creative and engaging. Groups will have 15 minutes to present their research project, followed by 5 minutes of questions from the audience. This will be accompanied by a 2-page research brief summarising your overall project.
