To complete this task, you should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select an example of everyday <strong>digital culture </strong>in a country other than Australia</li>\n<li>Describe and analyse the expressive and interactive aspects of your example as a <strong>social practice</strong>.</li>\n<li>Describe and analyse how the popularity of your example engages with and/or relies upon collective <strong>cultural norms</strong> in your chosen country<strong>.</strong></li>\n<li>Describe and analyse how your example helps us to understand <strong>cultural diversity</strong> in the world’s digital cultures.</li>\n<li>Offer conclusions about the <strong>contribution </strong>of your example to the wider field of global digital cultures (referring to one or more of the issues explored in the COMU 3300 course).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The COMU3300 Research Essay Guidelines</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Breakdown of Assessment:</strong></p>\n<p>In marking the content of your essay, the proportional breakdown of marks will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A well chosen example that allows effective execution of the essay components, with effective use of academic referencing, spelling and grammar (component 1 above ) (10 out of 40 marks).</li>\n<li>Demonstrated capacity to analyse the cultural dimensions of a specific social practice in your own words (components 2, 3 above ) (10 out of 40 marks)</li>\n<li>Demonstrated capacity to analyse your example of digital culture with reference to the cultural norms of a specific country (components 4, 5 above) (10 out of 40 marks)</li>\n<li>Demonstrated capacity to draw critical conclusions with reference to academic debates on global digital cultures (components 6, 7 above) (10 out of 40 marks).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tips on completing this assessment:</strong></p>\n<p>1. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate your capacity to research and analyse a specific instance of digital culture in a specific country (other than Australia).</p>\n<p>2. You need to ensure that you choose an example of everyday digital culture that you can clearly evidence, contextualize and assess critically. and a country that you can effectively research, describe and analyse in a cultural context.</p>\n<p>3. Your example should be supported by credible empirical evidence, which might include various sources of numerical data, graphics, public commentary, journalism, state policy, academic literature.</p>\n<p>4. The task of the essay is to employ a specific example of everyday digital culture in order to illustrate larger debates on global digital cultures.</p>\n<p>5. Your analysis should be centred upon your own interpretation of the cultural aspects of your chosen example and setting, supported but not driven by existing literature on the topic.</p>\n<p>6. You need to ensure that you choose an example that you can relate explicitly and productively to one or more of the theoretical issues covered in the COMU 3300 course.</p>\n<p>7. It may be a good idea to discuss your chosen topic and analytical focus with your tutor before you begin to write your final submission.</p>\n<p>8. There is no set number of references. The focus should be on the relevance and contribution of citations/quotations to the essay, your original analysis of the arguments that you reference and making sure all assertions of fact are supported by evidence of their source.
