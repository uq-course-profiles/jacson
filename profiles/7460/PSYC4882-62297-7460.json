Each student will present one paper during the semester. These papers have been chosen because they demonstrate how social psychological theories, models, and concept have been applied to understand the effect of genes vs environment on people. All are interesting in one way or another. None of the papers are perfect and some less so than others.  Do not be fooled by the length of the paper (some of the short ones are tricky) and do not be afraid to criticise the paper that you are presenting.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Tips for presenting the paper you've been assigned and the marking criteria can be found in the Presentation Criteria and Marking sheet on the course Blackboard site. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

We ask that you attend each of the presentations and come prepared to discuss the topic at hand. If you attend each of the presentations (in their entirety), actively contribute to the discussions, ask the speaker constructive and considered questions, demonstrate in your comments and questions that you clearly understand the topics that we’ve discussed, then you’ll be awarded full marks for participation. <strong>This element is worth 5% of your final grade. </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To be able to participate in this way it is necessary to adequately prepare for each session.  In the sessions that you are not presenting in you will need to come to class having read two of the papers that will be presented. These papers will be assigned to you. <strong> Prior to the session you will need to submit via Turnitin two questions for each paper that have occurred to you as a function of reading the paper assigned.</strong> <strong>These questions need to be submitted by 11am on the morning of the class</strong>.  Questions sent late will not be accepted to count towards your preparation mark. The questions you pose may be specifically about the paper (and may be asked of the presenter to clarify understanding) or they may be bigger philosophical questions about the area that could be used to provoke debate in the class. During the ‘open discussion’ part of the session for each paper you should feel able to ask your questions and/or contribute to the debate to earn your participation marks. Note: You do not need to prepare and send questions for the week in which you are presenting. <strong>This element is worth 10% of your final grade.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Note that the preparation and participation marks are independent of one another. There may be occasions where you fail to send through the questions as evidence of your preparation, but then manage to contribute meaningfully to the class. Similarly, there may be weeks where you have generated questions and emailed them through but do not attempt to contribute meaningfully in class.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In each seminar class, students will present. Each member of the audience (who has not presented in that session) will be asked to provide a rating out of 15 for each of the speakers along with feedback on the presentation (grade sheets will be distributed in each class). Each talk will be rated on Research and Delivery. These grades will be weighted and compiled with my assessment into a single mark. The feedback from the audience will be contribute to the 5% for the “Presentation Peer Review” and the comments will be returned to each speaker.  <strong>This element is worth 5% of your final grade.  </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
