It also shapes the way you may engage in your own learning experiences or how you might design and deliver learning experiences for others such as your students or colleagues. So, what is your personal philosophy of learning? To begin, you will write a blog entry summarising your current personal philosophy of learning. At the conclusion of Module 3 (Week 9) you will write a blog entry demonstrating how your personal philosophy of learning is informed by the focus, readings, activities, and discussions of the course so far, and additional literature pertaining to the science of learning. At the conclusion of the course, you will complete a final Blog (Week 12), reflecting on how your personal philosophy of learning has been informed by the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Guidelines:</strong> The blog entries will need to attend to the criteria as described in the EDUC7059 criteria sheet. The following questions serve as a guide for your blog entry responses.</p>\n<p><strong>Entry 1 – Formative assessment</strong></p>\n<p>The first of your blog entries needs to respond to the question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is your current personal philosophy of learning?</li>\n<li>What experiences/ ideas/ beliefs/ existing theories underpin your current philosophy?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Entry 2 - Formative Assessment</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>How does information from the recent Science of Learning lectures, readings and discussions inform/challenge/support your personal philosophy of learning, i.e.: how is your personal philosophy evolving?</li>\n<li>What might be some practical ways you could apply these insights from the Science of Learning into your practice as a learner or teacher/ leader of learning?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Final Entry</strong> <strong>SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT</strong>(Your final grade will be based on this response)</p>\n<p>1.  Reflect on your initial blog post.

The Science of Learning takes a multidisciplinary approach to understanding how people learn, the factors that affect learning, and what the implications of these findings are for teaching, learning design and learning technologies (Hayes, 2006). However, the inclusion of neuroscience in the study of learning has been the focus of an ongoing debate: over 20 years ago Bruer (1997) claimed that neuroscience was unable to offer direct, practical applications for classroom teachers. Today the debate continues as questions continue to be asked as to whether new understandings of brain structure and function can improve teaching practice and fundamentally, augment learning (Bowers, 2016). Contributing to this debate is the misuse of neuroscience research and findings in educational practice, evidenced through the prevalence of neuromyths, and a poor understanding of <em>how</em> to effectively translate research – particularly neuroscience research - into practice in unique teaching and learning contexts. Despite the ongoing debate and the noticeable challenges, the inclusion of insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology is increasingly popular in education and workplace training, with recent reviews of Initial Teacher Education in Australia calling for an understanding of ‘the brain and learning’ to be included as core knowledge (Australian Government, 2023).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your task is to <strong>demonstrate an understanding of the complexities and possibilities surrounding the critiquing, interpretation, and use of multi-disciplinary research in practice</strong>. You are to <strong>review the literature on both sides of the debate</strong> surrounding the ‘role of the brain in learning and <strong>present a well justified position in relation to your own professional context. </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>You must draw on course readings, course materials, and additional literature to clearly communicate the arguments and your position.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use the following questions to guide your response:</strong></p>\n<p>1.   Define the Science of Learning drawing on current literature, evaluating and describing the similarities and differences with related fields such as educational neuroscience, cognitive science, and the Learning Sciences.</p>\n<p>2.   Why is there still an ongoing debate about the role of the brain in learning? What are the contemporary and historical arguments for and against the inclusion of neuroscientific evidence in education?</p>\n<p>3.   What role do translational complexities play in the current debate relating to the role of the brain in learning? What cautions would you suggest (informed by the literature) practitioners in your professional context take when translating research into practice?</p>\n<p>4.   Reflecting on your responses above, present your position on the debate surrounding the ‘role of the brain in learning’ in your professional context. </p>\n<p><strong>Assignments should include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a clear introduction with an opening hook, outlining the organisation of the article and your key points to be addressed.</li>\n<li>a detailed discussion providing a response to each of the four key questions outlined above, using literature to support your discussion and to substantiate your position.</li>\n<li>a clear conclusion summarizing the main points of your discussion in relation to your own professional context.</li>\n<li>a correctly formatted reference list.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

However, seeking ways to overcome these complexities and challenges has immense value for the field and reciprocal benefits for both educators and researchers (Hobbis et al., 2018). Levin (2013) conceptualised the process of knowledge mobilisation as involving three domains: knowledge production, knowledge use, and knowledge mediation. Knowledge brokers – individuals who can act as a conduit between research and practice – are fundamental to effective knowledge mediation, supporting educators and other users of Science of Learning research to effectively engage with and apply research in contextually relevant ways (Brown, 2020; Cooper et al., 2020; Farley-Ripple, 2017; Gorard et al., 2020; Hobbis et al., 2019; Neal et al., 2015).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can play an important role in your context as a mediator of the science of learning by communicating clearly the relevant Science of Learning findings and principles and illustrating how these can be applied and evaluated in your own context.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your final assessment task is to prepare a professional presentation that explains and illustrates ways to mobilise a Science of Learning Principle into your teaching/ learning/ training context. </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The presentation is to be suitable for educators in your context and must feature some key practical applications. </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use the prompts below to guide your presentation.  </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Clearly set the context for your presentation, i.e.: who the audience is</em></li>\n<li><em>Clearly articulate and explain your chosen principle.</em></li>\n<li><em>Explain the role of the chosen principle in the learning process relevant to your identified audience.</em></li>\n<li><em>Synthesise and clearly communicate the key research supporting this principle</em></li>\n<li><em>Provide clear illustrations of how this principle can be applied into practice in your audiences context.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Your presentation may be presented as either a PowerPoint presentation, a keynote presentation, a video, or a podcast.  Regardless of mode, the translation presentation must:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>adhere to a maximum time limit of 10 minutes or 1500 words equivalent</li>\n<li>include an APA formatted reference list</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
