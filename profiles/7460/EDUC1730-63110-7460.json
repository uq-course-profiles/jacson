You can talk to a student from the class you are working in this semester, or may invite students that you know through family, friends or other connections. Ideally it should be a face-to-face conversation, but if this is not possible, then an online meeting is acceptable. If it is the latter, please make note of this in your assignment.</li>\n<li>Have a conversation with this student. Try not to make it into a formal interview – it is much easier to encourage young children to talk with you if you ask questions in an informal manner such as when you might play a game or go for a walk around the school together.</li>\n<li>Ask the student if it is okay for you to take audio or written notes to record the responses and comments they make.</li>\n<li>Note the student’s age, gender and any other personal characteristics that may be relevant (Indigeneity, ethnicity, languages spoken, special needs, etc). For example, if a student speaks more than one language, then that will be relevant to their uses of literacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The conversation should focus on two areas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, gather as much information as you can about the student’s areas of interest outside of school. For example, sport, music, computers, books etc. Are they passionate or very interested in a particular issue or topic in daily life? Think about the student’s virtual school bag. What expertise do they bring to the classroom?</li>\n<li>Second, talk about their experiences at school in relation to English and literacy. For some young children you may need to talk about reading or writing rather than English or literacy. You might like to ask students what they think makes a good teacher of English or literacy. You could ask students to assess their own abilities (e.g., Do you think you are a good reader? Why do you think this?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From your notes of this conversation, develop a literacy learning story that contains a 1) profile for the child and 2) reflection on your learning (1000 words for each section).</p>\n<p>In the profile include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal characteristics: age, gender, and any other personal characteristics that you consider relevant. Try to create a written image of the child so that the reader of your literacy learning story can imagine who you spoke to</li>\n<li>Interests and abilities: include information about activities both in and out of school</li>\n<li>Perceptions of English and literacy classes and teachers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the reflection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write about your learning from conducting the interview</li>\n<li>Specifically refer to both sections of the conversation</li>\n<li>Think about and discuss what implications these responses have for your future teaching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be assessed on your ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly describe the student, including their personal characteristics and engagement with English and literacy activities and practices.</li>\n<li>Synthesise critical and insightful understanding of the literacy experiences described by the student.</li>\n<li>Reflect on the implications raised by your literacy learning story for you as a teacher of English and literacy, based on your engagement with the course content and readings.</li>\n<li>Write a literacy learning story (profile and reflection sections) using appropriate styles and presentation.
