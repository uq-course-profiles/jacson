In preparation for each tutorial, you should read the required reading, and think about the relevance of the readings to peacebuilding. While discussion will be focused through the readings, you should also aim to build on your wider reading and learning in your peace and conflict studies. The criteria sheet for this item makes clear that attendance alone is not sufficient; you need to be an active participant in discussion, and should aim to sometimes lead discussion ‘from the floor’ by linking to what others say and posing questions to your colleagues. </p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<p>If a medical or other circumstance means you are unable to attend a particular tutorial, you may be permitted to undertake alternative assessment. Please contact the course coordinator directly <em>before </em>the date of the tutorial you are unable to attend. If the permission is granted, the course coordinator will liaise with you about the alternative assessment. If you have disability action plan (SAPD) or Student Access Plan (SAP) that specifies that you are unable to participate in tutorials, please contact the course coordinator to liaise about alternative assessment.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

You should identify a country, or region of a country to nominate your case.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Prepare a 5-minute video self-recording introducing the peacebuilding case that you will focus on during the course. Your video should specify the:</p>\n<p>o  Country or geographical region that you have chosen</p>\n<p>o  Main actors or parties to the conflict</p>\n<p>o  Core sources or causes of the conflict</p>\n<p>o  Key challenges for peacebuilding</p>\n<p>o  Possible focus that you may take for the Case Analysis assessment item, with an explanation about why this is important – either to the conflict case or for other reasons you wish to present. (Foci may include – but should not be limited to! - the security-development nexus, gender, coloniality/ethnicization, Indigenous peoples, gender, young people, transitional justice, DDR, memorialisation etc. You should choose a single focus.)</p>\n<p><strong>Guidance for video submission </strong></p>\n<p>o  Prepare your recording by Zoom through your UQ-linked profile by selecting the ‘Record to the cloud’ option. After recording you will be emailed (or can access) a link to your recording. To submit your video presentation, paste the ‘share with others’ link to your recording in the submission link in Blackboard.</p>\n<p>o  Please adopt a casual yet professional style.</p>\n<p>o  You can simply record to camera – you do not need to prepare a presentation.</p>\n<p>o  You should prepare notes to guide your presentation to camera. (It is common for people to believe that they can simply ‘talk’ without having a plan, but this rarely works well.)</p>\n<p>o  It is not necessary to script your presentation (and typically best not to). Please do not aim for perfection. It can be tempting to try re-recording to eliminate errors, but it is natural that your video recording has some minor errors in it (you do not need to produce a newsreader or studio quality video).</p>\n<p>o  10% above or below the length limit is fine.</p>\n<p>o  If you need to refer to sources in your video, please give enough key information for the viewer to be able to search for and find the source. E.g., for an academic article, the author, year, and name of the journal.</p>\n<p>o Begin your video by saying “Hello, my name is …. and this is my case description video’. </p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

Your proposal may target, for example, a national or regional policy maker, a United Nations agency, a religious body/bodies, Indigenous peace actors, a local community, or other actors/conflict parties of your choice – even insurgents.</p>\n<p>Please make clear your choice of target audience (the recipient for your proposal) on your title page and in your introduction.</p>\n<p>The introduction to your proposal should briefly summarise your peacebuilding case, the analysis conducted in the previous analysis report, and explain how you structure the remainder of your proposal report. The body of your report should draw upon relevant academic, professional and grey literature. It should:</p>\n<p>o  Develop your proposal in response to conflict dynamics or challenges.</p>\n<p>o  Clearly explain your proposal both in broad terms (what is the type of assistance/intervention proposed) and in the details (who should be involved, how will it bring about changes in dynamics).</p>\n<p>o  Identify the challenges and limitations of your proposal. </p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
