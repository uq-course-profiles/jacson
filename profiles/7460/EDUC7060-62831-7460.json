It is designed to foster an in-depth inquiry into the <strong>factors</strong> <strong>that</strong> <strong>contribute to the creation and maintenance of workplace cultures</strong>. This will be done by <strong>contextualising workplace</strong> <strong>culture</strong> <strong>through</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>critical</strong> <strong>literature</strong> <strong>review</strong>. <strong>You will explore workplace culture through a leadership lens.</strong> It is thus essential for you to engage with the relevant aspects of Themes 1 and 2 for the assignment. Note that it is appropriate and highly-encouraged to draw on material from outside the school/educational leadership domain for this paper. It is expected that you select at least five relevant sources for this task.</p>\n<p>Use the following question to provide a focus for your essay:</p>\n<p><strong>How has globalisation impacted the creation and maintenance of workplace cultures in your context (or one you are familiar with) in recent times?</strong></p>\n<p>Some suggestions on the topics that you can cover are as follows (these are suggestions and not compulsory options):</p>\n<p>•       <em>Globalisation has brought about rapid developments in technology and communications and how has this impacted your organization? </em></p>\n<p>•       <em>Globalisation has brought about changes within learning systems (ideas, values and knowledge with the changing roles of students and teachers).

Has this affected work place culture?</em></p>\n<p>•       <em>Globalisation has resulted in a borderless society and has that impacted workplace culture? </em></p>\n<p>•       <em>Global education has resulted in cross national boundaries, and interconnected systems on ecological, cultural, economical, political and technological grounds.

Methods (approximately 400 words)</p>\n<p>In the methods section, describe how the interviews were conducted. Provide a brief account of how questions were structured (e.g. open ended or closed) and why. A basic text on qualitative approaches to data collection (particularly interviews) will prove helpful.</p>\n<p>iii. Analysis (approximately 2,000 words)</p>\n<p>The analysis section is the principal part of the report. In the analysis, present and interpret interviewees' responses in light of relevant literature. The subject provides considerable relevant literature, but this needs to be supplemented with other relevant sources. </p>\n<p>iv. Conclusion (approximately 200 words)</p>\n<p>The conclusion summarises the main findings of the study and makes an assessment of the educational change in light of interviewees' responses and relevant literature.</p>\n<p><strong>OR</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Task Option B</strong></p>\n<p>As for task option A, but based on an interview with two (2) principal/senior administrator rather than three to five educators.</p>\n<p><strong>OR</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Task Option C</strong></p>\n<p>Develop your own topic in conjunction with the lecturer.
