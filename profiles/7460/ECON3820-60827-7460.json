During your first tutorial (Week 2) you will be allocated a week in the semester to present the key findings of your analysis. Your presentation is a short summary of key points and should last for 5-7 minutes. The presentation will be followed by class discussion and tutor feedback, designed to help improve your essay. </p>\n<p>FINAL ESSAY (20% of course marks). After your presentation you will have TWO weeks to make updates and improvements to your essay before submitting the final version via Turnitin. The essay should be a maximum of 2,000 words, excluding references.</p>\n<p>Points to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use any referencing system, so long as it is consistent, professional, and in alphabetical order.</li>\n<li>You are expected to have more references than just the two articles you are reviewing. </li>\n<li>When you submit your final essay, please use the provided template (located in the course blackboard) for a cover page including your name, student ID, course code/name, essay title, and the number of words in your essay.</li>\n<li>There are no other specific formatting requirements, but please ensure your essay is clearly structured, flows well and is professionally presented.</li>\n<li>In tutorials, you are expected to make critical comments and pose questions of other students' presentations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
