            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Interest in robotics (automated technology) is increasing in the horticulture sector due to a number of reasons, but particularly due to challenges associated with sourcing human labour for repetitive tasks. Students are to prepare a report that compares and contrasts the use of robotics (automated technology) with traditional practices/methods for a contemporary challenge related to a task/process. To complete this assignment, you may find it useful to first explore the definition of robotics (automated technology) and how to effectively write using ‘compare and contrast’, then select a horticulture industry of your choice (e.g., nursery, floriculture, vegetables or fruit) and for a particular enterprise (e.g., stone fruit orchard, hydroponic strawberry farm), research a production task/process where robotics (automated technology) could be used to overcome a contemporary problem.</p>\n<p>Note, selecting a production task/process where robotics (automated technology) are <strong>not</strong> already commonly used will demonstrate a higher level of critical thinking. For example, equipment that is used to sort individual fruit by weight and colour are commonly used in packing sheds, however, you may find equipment designed for packing lines with new capabilities that enhance shelf life and would be appropriate for this assignment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Guide for preparing the report</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Outline your chosen horticulture industry and the importance/purpose of the task/process you have selected. Explain the traditional practice/methods for the horticulture task/process you have chosen, including the contemporary challenge(s), and the robotics (automated technology) that could be used to solve the problem. (200 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Body</strong></p>\n<p>Compare and contrast traditional methods and the use of robotics (automated technology) for your chosen horticultural task/process. Ensure that you include scientific, plant/crop physiology, literature when comparing the differences and similarities. For example, if your task is pruning fruit trees, you would include the scientific reason for how much wood to remove and from where. (1200 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Restate the importance/purpose of the horticulture task and the challenge that could be solved by using robotics (automated technology). Summarise several key points resulting from the compare and contrast process. (150 words)</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>The majority of your papers should be published within the last 10 years.

It is recommended that you use either the block method, alternating method or similarities and differences method. Useful tips for these methods and using a Venn diagram to collate a list of similarities and differences to help organise your points can be found at <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/compare-contrast/\">https://www.grammarly.com/blog/compare-contrast/</a> You are welcome to include a diagram (e.g. Venn) in your report.</p>\n<p>Your assignment should contain headings and subheadings for clarity, and images (with sources referenced).

Within this period, you should talk for 5 minutes and answer questions for 2 minutes.</p>\n<p>PowerPoint presentations should be visually attractive and use images to explain your points rather than typed words. Keep word use to a minimum and use a clear font, such as Arial or Courier. Avoid reading directly from slides as it prevents you from connecting with your audience.</p>\n<p>Practice your presentation beforehand. Use language that is listener-friendly and scenarios that people can easily relate to. Pretend that you are describing your work to your parents or your best friend who is not necessarily a horticulturist but is educated and interested. Add a little humor to keep the presentation entertaining and interesting. Use voice tone and hand gestures to transmit information.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
