The Australian Curriculum has identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures as a cross-curriculum priority. You will also demonstrate your ability to embed Indigenous knowledges and perspectives in your curriculum area and discuss the theories, literature and policy that inform how and why teachers play an important role in shaping social and political discourse in Indigenous education.</p>\n<p>To do this work effectively, teachers must have the ability to engage in critical self-reflection and be proactive in identifying gaps in their knowledge and skills. As part of this portfolio, you will develop a future professional learning plan that outlines your plan to engage with a range of materials and learning to continue your professional learning and development in Indigenous education.</p>\n<p>There are three parts to your professional portfolio. In all sections, you are required to use scholarly sources (using APA) and refer to Indigenous education policy, relevant theories and literature to support the development of your portfolio.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Part A (500 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Professional statement</p>\n<p>You will write a professional statement outlining your intent to address the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers and the Australian Curriculum cross-priority aimed at addressing improving Indigenous education outcomes and practices. The statement can be added to your professional portfolio and <strong>can be written in first person</strong>. Your statement may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference to Indigenous education policy, the Australia Professional Standards for Teachers and the Australian Curriculum</li>\n<li>Your professional values</li>\n<li>Reference to reconciliation</li>\n<li>Theories and literature that have influenced your theories</li>\n<li>Reference to Indigenous aspirations in education</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Part B (2000 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Lesson plans and rationale</p>\n<p>You will develop two lesson plans that clearly demonstrate your ability to embed Indigenous Australian knowledges and perspectives into curriculum. You may use a lesson plan template used in your curriculum area but all lesson plans must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning objectives</li>\n<li>Year level</li>\n<li>Key learning area</li>\n<li>Time frame</li>\n<li>Pedagogical adjustments</li>\n<li>Indigenous material and resources used (with evidence of rigorous selection of the type of resources used)</li>\n<li>Mechanisms for evaluation of the lesson</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rationale</p>\n<p>The rationale will address the reasons why it is important for teachers to be capable and confident in addressing issues in Indigenous education, including engaging effectively and collaboratively with Indigenous students, families and communities, embedding Indigenous perspectives and how to teach Indigenous students.</p>\n<p><strong>This rationale</strong> <strong>will be written in third person</strong> and will reference scholarly sources only. This can include policy documents and peer reviewed literature. In the rationale, you will need to address:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why it is important for teachers to know Indigenous education policy and how to include it in their practice</li>\n<li>How theories can assist in addressing the issues</li>\n<li>How embedding Indigenous knowledges and perspectives addresses issues in Indigenous education and broader social issues</li>\n<li>Why it is important for teachers to engage and work in partnership with Indigenous peoples and communities</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Part C (500 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Indigenous Education professional development</p>\n<p>The professional development plan can be written in first person. This section is designed to allow you to self-assess gaps that might still exist in your understanding of Australian histories, your culture and standpoint, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and histories and Indigenous education frameworks and approaches. You may identify materials from a range of sources including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indigenous community events and organisations</li>\n<li>Professional development sessions</li>\n<li>Books</li>\n<li>Web based resources</li>\n<li>Documentaries</li>\n<li>A suggested template for your plan is below</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Gap area <strong>I</strong> Resource (reference or information <strong>I</strong> How will engaging with resource address the gap <strong>I</strong> How does this address policy (APSTs, Aust.
