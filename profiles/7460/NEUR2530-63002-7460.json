The learning task can be from any school, sporting, or clinical setting you like - you might like to choose something that you might one day be required to “teach” in a professional setting, or just a movement that interests you. Specific examples will be considered and discussed in the workshops designed to help you to prepare for this report. You will need to identify the key control characteristics of a motor skill task that you will need to teach, provide the context of the learning setting and the experience level and movement background of your “client”, and then outline an instruction, practice, feedback and assessment plan for the client. You will be judged on the quality of your skill analysis and skill acquisition plan, and especially on your demonstration and application of motor control and motor learning principles.</p>\n<p>In groups of 3 or 4 people, you will be required to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agree on a motor skill and learning context with your group, and sign a group contract that describes group member contributions.</li>\n<li>Identify and describe the key control features (e.g. importance of feedback, feedforward control – speed-accuracy requirements, perception vs decision vs control importance – etc) and neural structures that are relevant to a motor skill that you aim to help your hypothetical client to acquire. </li>\n<li>Describe the learning context and movement background of your hypothetical client. This will be important for making decisions about what tools and strategies you should use to facilitate skill acquisition.</li>\n<li>Describe the methods you will use to assess your client’s level of expertise on the skill – and the schedule of when these assessments will be performed.</li>\n<li>Describe the approach you will take to providing information about the skill to the client, and the details of the practice you will have them undertake. Consider issues such as the type and frequency of instructions/demonstrations, feedback and task modifications. Make sure that you give a rationale based on your conceptual understanding of motor control and learning for each component of your approach. </li>\n<li>Rate your group members on the degree to which they fulfilled the group contract.</li>\n<li>Detail the prompt history of your AI generative writing (or lack there of). What limitations did you encounter writing this assignment and how were they addressed?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Format:</strong> Structure your report into sections according to the 4 main task components. Each section should address the marking criteria through a combination of paragraphs, dot points, and/or tables. The precise format is open, but you should aim to make it easy for the person marking the piece to identify how you have addressed the criteria, and for a person reading your report to follow the plan you outline. You must also append a copy of your group contract.</p>\n<p>AI generative writing is permitted for this assignment, which allows for a complex/authentic assessment using AI to support learning. Whether AI generative writing is used or not, an AI appendix section must be included to detail a history of prompts used (see Blackboard assessment details). Outside of the AI Appendix, a maximum of 10 pages is allowed (5-6 pages should be sufficient if you are concise). </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
