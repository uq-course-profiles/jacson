As a teacher, you will need to demonstrate an understanding and importance to the learning of mathematics and numeracy. Mathematics is a key learning area in primary school curriculum and has been identified as a gatekeeper subject for employment and further education. Primary teachers need to embed numeracy across the curriculum as a general capability in the Australian Curriculum.</p>\n<p><strong>Task:</strong> For this task, you are to use contemporary research perspectives of mathematics and numeracy to select and critically evaluate two digital resources that illustrate teaching numeracy and mathematics in action (500 words each). One selected resource must be a strong example and one must be a poor example in relation to contemporary research.</p>\n<p>You will need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage with contemporary research literature to:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>examine the pervasive role of mathematics and numeracy across the curriculum and how this potentially impacts on life after school in personal and community life, work and further education;</li>\n<li>understand the importance of student dispositions, attitudes and affects in relation to learning mathematics;</li>\n<li>demonstrate knowledge of research into how students learn mathematics and numeracy and the implications for teaching.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Search for, identify and critically evaluate two digital teaching and learning resources of varying quality (strong and poor) for numeracy in mathematics and broader curriculum areas.</li>\n<li>Select the <em>better </em>of your two digital resources to share with your peers in a class wiki.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Digital resources </strong>in this assignment are technological tools that a teacher and/or students can use to develop students’ understanding and appreciation of mathematics or numeracy. They must be interactive rather than static (eg not Youtube clips) and aim to develop students’ mathematics or numeracy. They must be freely available at no cost.</p>\n<p><strong>A critical evaluation</strong> in this assignment is an academic argument that weighs the benefits, limitations and further insights about the extent to which a digital resource develops students’ mathematics or numeracy, using (citing) contemporary research to justify points.</p>\n<p>For the task, you must complete the following:</p>\n<p>1. Structured description and critical evaluation for each of two digital resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One digital resource that <em>best </em>exemplifies learning mathematics and/or numeracy in terms of contemporary research. Include a title, image, URL and short description of the resource (50 words), followed by a critical evaluation (500 words).</li>\n<li>One digital resource that <em>poorly </em>exemplifies learning mathematics and/or numeracy in terms of contemporary research. Include a title, image, URL and short description of the resource (50 words), followed by a critical evaluation (500 words).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Uploaded copy of the title, image, URL and short description of the best digital resource from #1a in the relevant category of the class wiki in Blackboard. It is not ideal, but acceptable (no penalty) if someone else has selected the same example.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The fact that you can make your own presentation media means that you can bring relevance from the real world into the classroom. You can also make the link between Mathematics and Numeracy more readily than in the past. In the classroom, teacher media production serves as an important model for students who are making their own media using devices such as iPads. Your use of digital media tools will allow you to develop technical and communication skills in critical and creative ways to expand curriculum learning opportunities for all students including those from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds. At the same time, you will develop knowledge and understanding of the kinds of teaching strategies needed for using ICT such as those involved in the use and production of presentation media to support and expand curriculum learning opportunities for students. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Task:</strong> For this assignment, you will work in a group of 2 to create a teaching video, digital media or multi-media slide deck (eg Powerpoint, Google Slides, Apple Keynote) for a primary school aged audience that explores a real-life mathematics scenario.

To be sustainable teacher-produced media, it just has to be competently made in a timely fashion. The information has to be correct. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part B: The Research Report</strong></p>\n<p>This task also requires you to individually produce a research brief (1000 words) in which you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make clear connections between the real world context you selected and the numeracy in it </li>\n<li>Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of research into how students learn the mathematical concept you are exploring and the implications for teaching of embedding it into a real-life context</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
