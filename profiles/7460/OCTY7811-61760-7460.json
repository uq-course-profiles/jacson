Students will then be required to record themselves presenting their poster in a short video which will be uploaded onto learn.UQ and shared as a study resource. Each presentation should provide information regarding the origin, termination (or branching) and function of their allocated cranial nerve or blood vessel, including relevance for occupational performance. These posters and the associated presentation will be marked and feedback will be provided. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Students must complete and submit an individual contribution sheet outlining the percentage of contribution of each member of the group. Each student in the group must complete a separate individual contribution sheet and indicate the contributions of all group members including themselves. The % given to each student by each group member will then be added and the overall grade will be adjusted according to contribution. For contributions of 95% and over students will receive 100% of the group mark. For contributions of less than 95%, the individual mark will be 90% of the group mark. However, if contributions total less than 55% for the assignment then that student will receive 55% of the group mark (the minimum mark based on the individual contributions however will be a passing mark). Individual contribution sheets are to be submitted online via Learn.UQ. Details on use of Individual Contribution Sheet will be provided on Learn.UQ.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
