Please choose the articles very carefully (i.e., from reputable peer-reviewed journals), as the credibility of your selected sources will be assessed. For each article answer the following questions in your presentation:</p>\n<p><strong>1. What is the phenomenon under investigation and what research question(s) did the article attempt to answer?</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the phenomenon or topic the article investigated and state the research question(s) and, where relevant, any hypotheses that were tested.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What was the motivation for study?</strong></p>\n<p>Describe the motivation for the research undertaken. If possible, specify how it relates to, refines and extends. Describe the gap the articles aimed to fill. Be specific. Name and cite the previous studies where appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What methodology was used?</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the research methodology used to address the research question(s): Who were the participants? How was the data collected and analysed? How many participants were analysed? What corpus was used? What tools/techniques/procedures/methods were used?</p>\n<p><strong>4. What were the findings?</strong></p>\n<p>Briefly state the results of the study. Were the research question(s) addressed? Were the hypotheses proved or disproved? What did the study find?</p>\n<p><strong>5. What were the limitations and implications of the study?</strong></p>\n<p>What were limitations or shortcomings of the study? Evaluate the study's value (contribution to the field) and shortcomings (and were there any suggested improvement to mitigate those limitations?).</p>\n<p>Prepare slides for your presentation and record yourself and the slides (we suggest you use Zoom and share your screen). The entire presentation should be between 9 and a maximum of 11 minutes (recordings must not be longer than 11 minutes). Your answers should be presented as a coherent, clear, logical, and engaging manner. Each article should be no longer than 4 minutes. Your answers should be presented as a coherent summary of the articles. Bibliographic details for each article should be presented in APA 7 citation style when you start summarising and discussing the paper. Any sources or citations mentioned in your presentation need to be added in a reference list at the end of your presentation (which should also be formatted according to APA7). After completing the summary and description of the two articles or studies, compare and critically evaluate the articles. This should also take about 3 minutes. Comment on differences and similarities across the articles. These common features might include the kind of research questions asked and the motivations used, the object of study, etc. Evaluate the methodologies and the presentation of results in the articles. Have the articles answered the research questions? Were the data and methods appropriate to answer the research questions? How were the results presented? Was one study better than the other and, if so, why and how?</p>\n<p>Your slides and your presentation should be engaging and informative. Your slides should not be too text heavy, and the slides should contain the main aspects of what you say/present. Use appropriate language without errors both on the slides and in your presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement on Gen AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task.. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
