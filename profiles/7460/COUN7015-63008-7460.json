Imagine that you are the therapist listening to this client tell their story.</p>\n<p>This assessment is designed to evaluate your clinical skills in reflective listening, asking broader and deeper questions that further your understanding of the client experience (using the biopsychosocial-spiritual (BPSS) model as a framework), and in case formulation (understanding the main presenting issues for the client and why they are occurring). </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will watch a 10-minute video vignette of a client describing their experience with a health condition or capacity challenge. After watching the video, you will have 50 minutes to complete the assessment tasks.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Tasks:</strong></p>\n<p>Reflective Listening Skills:</p>\n<p>a. Identify two instances in the video where you could have made a simple reflection. Provide the specific time point in the client vignette and the reflective statements you would have made.</p>\n<p>b. Identify two instances where you could have made a complex reflection. Provide the specific time point in the client vignette and the reflective statements you would have made.</p>\n<p>Exploratory Questioning within the BPSS Framework:</p>\n<p>a. Identify two questions you would ask the client to gain a broader and deeper understanding of their experience, using the BPSS model as a framework.</p>\n<p>Case Formulation (BPSS Model Application):</p>\n<p>a. Based on the client's story presented in the video, identify two main presenting issues for the client. For each presenting issue, describe the relevant BPSS factors involved and how they may interact or contribute to the issue.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Please note that you will be evaluated based on your ability to demonstrate reflective listening skills, formulate appropriate questions within the BPSS framework, and identify presenting issues while considering the interplay of biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors. Assessing these skills will be contingent on your ability to provide clear and succinct written responses that express your approach.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
