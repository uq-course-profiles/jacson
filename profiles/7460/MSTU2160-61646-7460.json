This would involve responding to discussion prompts on the microphone in the seminars, and, in the workshops, participating in in-class archive research training exercises, analysis of primary sources, and writing short viewing reflections during class time, which we can then use as basis of further discussion. Those students who find speaking in class difficult will be given the option of synchronous participation using the Google Doc that will be sent out each week.</p>\n<p><strong>If you cannot attend class due to illness, or have not participated in the in-person class: </strong>You can earn marks by doing the catch-up worksheet. The worksheets will be placed on Blackboard in the assessment folder, and each week will have a different set of short questions and tasks. While it is recommended that you submit weekly in order to keep up with the course, the final deadline is 4pm Friday of Week 13. They are to be submitted via the assignment submission button in the worksheets folder on Blackboard. </p>\n<p>In terms of learning outcomes, in-person participation is better, as students learn the archive research skills in the workshops (and these skills are the key to doing well in the archive research essay), gain continuous feedback within the seminars and workshops, and can talk their ideas through and test them with others, in more depth. </p>\n<p><strong>For marking criteria and more information please see the assessment information on Blackboard.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Academic Integrity and AI/MT:</strong> </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
