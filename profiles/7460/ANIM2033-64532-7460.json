The exercise aims to introduce students to stakeholder engagement and basic conflict resolution strategies.</p>\n<h4>Activities:</h4>\n<p><strong>Activity 1: Pre-Meeting Preparation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students will be assigned roles such as local government officials, conservationists, local business owners, and community members.</li>\n<li>Meet with your stakeholder group.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Discuss the potential impacts of the facility on the local community and environment.</p>\n<p>Create a spider map that details your group’s major concerns, values and objectives (see page 1-4 of the role play instructions on blackboard). The spider map will not be assessed, but can be added as an appendix to the position statement (optional)</p>\n<p>Prepare for the meeting. As a group, answer the questions on page 6 of the role play instructions (on blackboard). The answers to these questions are not assessed but the group discussion will help you prepare your position statement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individually</li>\n<li>Prepare a concise position statement outlining their stakeholder’s perspective on the zoo's opening. This will be submitted individually and will be assessed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Activity 2: Participation in Townhall Meeting</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each stakeholder group presents their position in a 3-minute speech. Each stakeholder group will allocate a spokesperson for this.</li>\n<li>Engage in a structured discussion, with each student responding to at least two other stakeholders’ positions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Activity 3: Reflection Report</strong>:</p>\n<p>Individually</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write a reflection report discussing the insights gained from the role-play about human-wildlife conflict and stakeholder engagement.</li>\n<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of different arguments and strategies presented during the meeting.</li>\n<li>Use the questions on page 8 of the role play instructions to guide you (see blackboard).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables (individually)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A position statement (500 words)</li>\n<li>A reflection report (1000 words)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The position statement and the reflection report are due on Friday week 4 at 2:00PM.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The role play will take place during the workshop in week 3 from 2PM-3:30PM. This scheduling applies to all students, including both internal and external participants.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Attendance Requirement:</strong> Like an exam, the role play is a crucial component of your assessment and require either in-person attendance or participation online. </p>\n<p><strong>Rescheduling Due to Conflicts:</strong> If you have prior commitments, such as work obligations, that might conflict with your scheduled role play time, it is your responsibility to arrange for these commitments to be rescheduled. The role play must take priority as it is integral to your assessment in this class.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning Ahead:</strong> Please review your schedules now to ensure availability during your assigned role play time slot. If you foresee any conflicts, make arrangements as soon as possible to avoid any issues.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: This is a mandatory component of the course, and your proactive planning and attendance are essential for successful completion. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The IUCN Good Practice Checklist is a tool designed to guide conservation practitioners, researchers, and students in evaluating, planning, and implementing human-wildlife conflict management strategies. It consists of key questions that are structured around foundational principles critical to conflict resolution and coexistence strategies.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h4>Instructions:</h4>\n<p><strong>Select a Conflict</strong>: Choose a real-world human-wildlife conflict. Briefly describe the involved species, affected human communities, and the geographical context.</p>\n<p><strong>Good Practice Checklist Application</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify Conflict Levels</strong>: Assess and categorize the conflict level using simple criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong>: Discuss potential ethical issues and the roles of primary stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Ecological and Social Contexts</strong>: Provide a general overview of the natural behaviors of the involved wildlife and basic social factors affecting the conflict.</li>\n<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: Suggest methods for involving key stakeholders in resolving the conflict.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic Planning and Actions</strong>: Propose straightforward, actionable steps for conflict management based on class discussions and readings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management Plan Components</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preventative and Mitigation Strategies</strong>: Outline basic strategies to prevent and mitigate wildlife damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Simple Monitoring and Evaluation</strong>: Describe how the plan’s effectiveness could be checked through simple measures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Report and Presentation</strong>: Prepare a short report and a presentation that summarizes the management plan, focusing on the application of the good practice checklist.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h4>General Instructions:</h4>\n<p><strong>Familiarization</strong>: Begin by thoroughly reading the Good Practice Checklist available in the IUCN guidelines. Understand the intent and focus of each question within the checklist.</p>\n<p><strong>Application to the Conflict Scenario</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For each relevant section of the checklist, clearly articulate how it applies to your selected conflict scenario.</li>\n<li>Provide specific examples where applicable to illustrate how the checklist guides the decisions and strategies in your management plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Integration</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate responses to the checklist into your overall management plan, using them to structure the report.</li>\n<li>Ensure that each part of the checklist is addressed in relation to the conflict scenario, emphasizing how it informs your proposed strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reflection</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reflect on the checklist’s role in shaping your approach to human-wildlife conflict.</li>\n<li>Discuss any limitations or additional considerations that might extend beyond the checklist’s scope.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Simplicity and Clarity</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on applying the checklist to ensure that all basic aspects of conflict management are covered. Use the checklist to structure your report, addressing each point in a clear and concise manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic conflict management report</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Submission format:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Word Limit</strong>: Your report should not exceed 2500 words. Each section of the checklist should be addressed succinctly, providing just enough detail to show understanding and application without extensive depth.</li>\n<li><strong>Report Structure</strong>: Organize your report to follow the structure of the checklist, with each section of your management plan corresponding to checklist items.</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Aids</strong>: Include tables, figures, or charts that help illustrate how checklist items are applied within your management plan.</li>\n<li><strong>References</strong>: Cite all sources appropriately, including any direct references to the IUCN guidelines and the checklist.
