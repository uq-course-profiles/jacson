The schedule for this exam will be posted on Blackboard in Week 10. The following aspects of spoken Chinese will be assessed: pronunciation; the range/accuracy of grammar and expressions used; fluency and quality of content. The exam is also used to assess the ability to ask and comprehend the other speaker as well as to respond in an appropriate manner as both an interviewer and an interviewee. <strong>Palm cards are not allowed in Oral Interview.</strong></p>\n<p> There are two parts to the oral exam: role-play and question-and-answer.</p>\n<p> <strong>Role-play</strong>: you are expected to perform with your partner one of four role-plays based on the lessons covered this semester. A handout on the scenarios of the role-plays will be provided in Week 11. You should prepare ahead for all the role-plays. The details of each role-play given in the handout are guides only. Feel free to express your creativity and depart from the details if you so desire. Either way, you will need to extend a bit on the basic framework provided. Ten minutes before your exam time slot you will be randomly allotted one of the four role-plays. Your role-play should last around 2-3 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Question-and-answer:</strong> your assessor(s) will ask each of you a number of questions. You should respond with an answer of moderate length (that is, not just “yes” or “no”). Try and extend a bit on the questions asked. A handout of sample questions will be provided in week 13. You should prepare ahead as most questions will be drawn from this list. There may be a couple of follow-up questions in some instances. The question-and-answer session should last around 7-8 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation guidelines will be available in Blackboard.</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task..
