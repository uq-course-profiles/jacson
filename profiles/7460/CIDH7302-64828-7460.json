In the synthesis, you will briefly outline the healthcare setting of your choice and create a problem statement. Your problem statement will define a challenge faced by the healthcare setting that can be addressed by a digital health intervention. Discuss why this problem needs to be addressed and how it will advance the Quadruple aim of healthcare.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
