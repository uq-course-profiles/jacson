The thesis should introduce the project, explaining the motivation and the wider context of the research field. It should show familiarity with the literature (and the literature review that was due half-way through will likely form the basis of this part of the thesis). The description of the project should be thorough enough that a new student wanting to reproduce the work would be able to do so, based on the information given. The thesis should show clearly what aspect of the project work was performed by the student. Results of the research should be clearly presented, and interpreted, with an explanation of how the findings fit into the current state of research in the area. The student may want to include in their conclusion options for how this project could be extended in the future.</p>\n<p>Length is around 50 pages. This length is a guideline. Heavily theoretical theses tend to be shorter, while experimental theses with many plots and a lot of data to display tend to be longer. Conciseness and clarity is appreciated by assessors.
