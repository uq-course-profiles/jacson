These components may vary slightly depending on the specific requirements of the research proposal and the academic discipline.

This document should have an interesting title and project Summary, along with other sections for Introduction, Background, and Project Timeline. References are an essential part and should be presented in the standard Author/Date format. Students are encouraged to use Endnote or other referencing software but should not rely solely on it, as there is no guarantee that it will format references exactly as prescribed. The reference list is not included in the word count.</p>\n<p>We expect students to incorporate background information on the research topic, outline the significance of the study, and briefly introduce the research question or hypothesis in the introduction. In the Background section, students need to provide a critical analysis of existing literature relevant to the research topic. They should demonstrate their understanding of the current state of knowledge in the field and identify gaps or areas for further investigation. The Research Objectives section should contain clearly articulated statements of the goals or research questions that the research aims to address.</p>\n<p>Please be mindful of the word limit while describing the research design, methods, and techniques that will be used to collect and analyse data.
