Details are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Prac worksheets (10%): </p>\n<p>Each student will attend 2 prac sessions during weeks 2 to 5. The prac worksheets for pracs 1 and 2 will be available on Blackboard in week 1. Students will be required to follow the prac worksheets to complete all the specified tasks and answer all the questions given in prac worksheets. The completed worksheets will need to be submitted at the end of prac sessions for marking or will be marked during the prac session. The 2 prac worksheets will be on the following topics:</p>\n<p>Prac worksheet 1 (weeks 2 and 3): Operational Amplifiers- Compare the real world characteristics of a widely used op-amp to its specification. Measure and compare bias currents, offset voltage, input impedance, output impedance, saturation, gain bandwidth, CMRR. Weight: 5%</p>\n<p>Prac worksheet 2 (weeks 4 and 5): RLC Circuits- Compare the real world responses of series and parallel RLC circuits with the calculated responses. Measure and compare for step, ramp and sinusoidal inputs. Weight: 5%</p>\n<p>2. Design challenge report (20%):</p>\n<p>A 15 page report jointly written with a lab partner on the solution to the Design Challenge, including theoretical grounding, design basis, experimental results and discussion. Details of the report format are available for download from the course web page. To be submitted on Thursday of week 13, by 4 pm. <strong>Due date: October 24, 4pm via Blackboard</strong></p>\n<p>Only electronic submission is required. Electronic submission is to be made through Blackboard Turnitin. Hardcopy submission is not required.
