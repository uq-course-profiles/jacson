For full details, including the marking rubric, please refer to the course Learn UQ (Blackboard) site.</strong></p>\n<p>In Week 5, students will be allocated to groups for their second assessment task: Group presentation (in-class) – Case analysis. PowerPoint slides are due in Week 9, and presentations are conducted in-person outside of tutorials during Week 10. The purpose of your conversation is to (1) <em>analyse </em>the case study provided, taking into consideration the main character's developmental tasks and transitions across their lifespan; their current level of functioning, including both strengths and difficulties; and sources of risk, adversity, and resilience in their life; and (2) <em>consider </em>ways of supporting the main character in coping with past and current adversities, risks, and difficulties, promoting their strengths, and enhancing their resilience. This task requires students to work in groups of three to four to prepare and present a professional conversation about the case study provided. The conversation will be maximally 6 minutes per group member, that is, a total maximum of 18 minutes for a group of three students and 24 minutes for a group of four. Your presentation will be supported with PowerPoint slides, to which all members are expected to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.  </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
