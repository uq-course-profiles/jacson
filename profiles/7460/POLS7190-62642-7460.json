The videos are due in the range from 16th August to 16th October.</p>\n<p>Your reflection should aim to link your experience of learning with a) one of the required readings for the chosen week you are reflection upon, b) the class discussion for the week in which you are submitting and c) one of the course learning objectives (Section 5 in this document). Please note that this assessment item is not asking you to demonstrate your knowledge, but to reflect upon how you are coming to know. Appropriate self-analysis and critique is crucial for this task. Consider, for instance, that our relationship with our knowing can be emotional. Learning may be challenging, confronting, affirming, disarming, surprising, frustrating. You should openly discuss these and other experiences in engaging with the topic (including readings, class discussion, links to learning objectives) and link that with your experience of learning.</p>\n<p>You are not required to refer to readings beyond those for the weekly topic, but if you do refer to additional sources, you should give sufficient details for your viewer to trace the source. E.g., for a journal article, author name, year, journal name (adding a page number if a direct quote). </p>\n<p><em>If you choose</em>, one of your video submissions may be a plan for the Issue Analysis and Commentary paper or (for your 5th and final video) a reflection on your overall experience with your course. These videos should (similarly to the regular submissions) link your planning for the paper or experience of the course with your coming to know in relation to the course learning objectives (Section 5 in this document).</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT). Failure to comply with this direction may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Guidance</em></strong></p>\n<p>Prepare your recording by Zoom through your UQ-linked profile by selecting the ‘Record to the cloud’ option. After recording you will be emailed (or can access) a link to your recording. To submit your video presentation, paste the ‘share with others’ link to your recording into the submission link in Blackboard. Other guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare notes (minimally) or a script (maximally) before you deliver your presentation to camera. It is common for people to believe that they can simply ‘talk’ without having a plan or a script, but this rarely works well.</li>\n<li>Do not aim for perfection. It can be tempting to try re-recording to eliminate errors, but it is natural that your video recording has some minor errors in it (you do not need to produce a newsreader or studio quality video).</li>\n<li>Observe the video length limit (10% under or over is fine).</li>\n<li>Begin your video by stating: \"My name is [XX] and this is my [insert first, second, etc,] video reflection.\"</li>\n<li>See the criteria sheet for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
