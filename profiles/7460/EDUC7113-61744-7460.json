            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Task 1: Action research problem statement Action research in education is a reflective research practice that many experienced teachers engage in. It usually relates to improving practice with a key question asking – “How can I improve what I do in relation to…” (see for instance Getting to Know the Problem, Trying to Find a Solution section in McAteer chapter). However, if you are not currently practicing as a teacher you may look at inquiring into something that you are interested in, perplexed by or want to change by analysing documents (policies, curricula, websites) to inform your future practice.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>For the action research to be manageable within the semester time frame, it is preferable to focus your inquiry on analysis of texts that are publicly available (e.g., curriculum and policy documents, websites), and/or self-reflections of own practice. Inclusion of reflections of small number of colleagues can be manageable, if you have no intention to publish from this analysis (while coursework is exempt from ethical approval, publications are not). </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Define your inquiry by forming a problem statement and key question and sub questions. Use p. 15 of Efron and Ravid (2013) as a guide for writing a problem statement and pp. 31- 33 for guidance on research questions. The purpose of this task is to clarify focus of your inquiry. (300 words, written submission) Prepare and submit a presentation to introduce your problem context and argue the significance of your inquiry in that context.

(Read pp. 17-31 on developing a literature review in Efron &amp; Ravid, 2013) • Consolidate all this information into a literature review. • Plan actions that you have and/or will undertake over the next 1-2 months to understand the phenomena of your inquiry informed by your review of the issue. List what you will read, what documents you will analyse, and what data you will gather (e.g., personal reflections of practice) to understand your inquiry, noting the time period for each action</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Please see Task Description on Blackboard site for more details.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The report documents the actions that you took to understand the literacy and numeracy education issue further, and your reflections and interpretations of these actions. From the documents (e.g., policy documents, websites, reports, teaching reflective journaling/ drawing/ memos) that you gather identify themes and patterns (see Ch. 7 of Efron &amp; Ravid (2013) on qualitative data analysis) and discuss these in relation to what the literature says. Then write conclusions and implications from your assessment of the issue (see pp. 215-217 Efron &amp; Ravid (2013) for a guide). Use Efron &amp; Ravid (2013) as a guide for writing a report. The required sections are mapped out on pp. 226-230, though those of you not focusing your inquiry within a teaching context you will not have a research site and participants section. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Please see Task Description on Blackboard site for more details.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
