Google Scholar, PubMed, Food Science and Technology Abstracts) or from CDC (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/multistate-outbreaks/outbreaks-list.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/multistate-outbreaks/outbreaks-list.html </a>). In the analysis of the food poisoning outbreak you should provide details of where it happened, how many people became ill, what symptoms presented, what the average incubation period was, what food(s) were implicated and then confirmed, how the outbreak was investigated, what pathogen caused the illness (how was this pathogen confirmed?). How the organism contaminated the food and/or was allowed to multiply should be made very clear. Details on how the outbreak could have been avoided should also be discussed. The case analysis should clearly demonstrate relationship between the most common symptoms and incubation periods with that typically caused by the pathogen. You should provide some detail on the characteristics of the foodborne pathogens in context of the outbreak analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra information: </strong></p>\n<p>Remember that you will be delivering this presentation to your classmates so it is important that your group make sense of the material and present it in a clear understandable manner. The number of slides should be around 10-12 and it should go for at least 9 minutes and no longer than 11 minutes. The slides should have not too much text and there should be a good mix with diagrams, pictures, tables etc. The sources of all figures etc should be acknowledged in the particular slides that they are used.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips for food poisoning bacteria oral presentation slide organisation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong> -</strong>Always have bacterial names in italics (for the first time, write the bacterial name in full [e.g. <em>Escherichia coli</em>], then every time after that you can abbreviate the genus [e.g. <em>E. coli</em>]</p>\n<p>-Use dot points and not sentences (less text is better)</p>\n<p>-Include pictures, diagrams and tables (but make sure you explain them)</p>\n<p>- Include one final summary slide which summarises the main points of the talk.</p>\n<p>Useful link:</p>\n<p>Bad Bug Book: http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/intro.html</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
