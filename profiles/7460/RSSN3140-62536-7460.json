The assessment will consist of a <strong>8-minute multimedia video-presentation in Russian to be submitted via Blackboard during the Examination Period as an mp4 file along with the transcript. </strong> </p>\n<p>To prepare for the presentation, students are to schedule 3 meetings 40-50 minutes long (preferably in person, but also possible by Zoom or other video-communication platform) during which they will ask their interview partner and answer about themselves a series of questions related to the topics discussed in class. The goal is to have a real conversation in which students and members of the Russian-speaking community learn about each other and form shared inter-cultural knowledge. The presentation should aim at consolidating the most important information about the interview partner from all three meetings. While showcasing the students’ knowledge of vocabulary and grammar learned this semester, the presentation should not only <strong>synthesize important differences and similarities between the partner and the students </strong>that transpired from these meetings but also<strong> highlight the inter-cultural learning </strong>that happened during the interviews. </p>\n<p>Also as part of preparation for the presentation, after each interview meeting, students are asked to write a short summary in Russian of what they learned about/from their partner and submit it via Blackboard for formative feedback (<strong>3 summaries total, at least 300 words each). </strong>Although the summaries are not assessed, their goal is to help students to consolidate what they have learned and use the feedback to prepare for the presentation. </p>\n<p><strong>The due date for the assessment (upload of the presentation and script on Blackboard) is 5pm on the Friday of Week 1 in the Examination Period</strong>. </p>\n<p>*The suggested timing of the interviews is around Weeks 4, 8 and 12 is to help the students pace themselves.
