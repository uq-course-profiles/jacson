Identifying a meaningful action you can take at a local level will reinforce the connection between the course material and your local concerns. \"Actions\" can take many forms, from professional to personal activities. At professional levels this may be in relation to: changing how your agency, company or group operates; the type(s) of work it does, specific projects; or how your workplace functions? At a personal levels this could changes you make to your behaviours/lifestyle, or participation in volunteer activities etc.   </p>\n<p>In the planning/proposal stage and final report, you will be assessed on your reflection and evaluation of the action, not the action itself.</p>\n<p>This is an individual task.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For this assessment item prepare an \"Action Plan\" using the following headings in a structured document, up to 2500 words, (include figures, tables and references if helpful). References are not included in the word limit:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Action Plan Headings:</em></strong></p>\n<p>i) Title page</p>\n<p>ii) Table of Contents</p>\n<p>iii) Declaration of AI Generated Content</p>\n<p>1. Reflection on discussions and materials from Tutorials 1-4 (weeks 1-4) and relevant literature to justify selection of your \"Global Change Action\"</p>\n<p>2. For your selected global change - what types of Actions been taken to adapt or manage it previously?</p>\n<p> 3. Outline the action you will take and its expected outcomes</p>\n<p> 4. Outline the process(es) you will use to assess how effective your action was</p>\n<p>5. References</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Examples of “actions” you could take include:</strong></p>\n<p>- research an issue and write to your local Member of Parliament about it (eg climate change policy, energy policy, environmental conservation policy) or local councillor (eg urban planning, transport planning, bikeways, green space)</p>\n<p>- join a volunteer event/group, eg planting on campus, community garden, refugee support</p>\n<p>- join an advocacy event, eg a protest, march etc</p>\n<p>- assist with a citizen science initiative (eg bird observations, classifying coral online)</p>\n<p>- make change in your home or workplace - eg reduce waste, identify energy policy and discuss with decision makers how to change</p>\n<p>- make change in your home or workplace - eg reduce waste, identify energy policy and discuss with decision makers how to change</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Example of what is not a suitable “action”:</strong></p>\n<p>Discussing a global change concept or response with family, friends, colleagues.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
