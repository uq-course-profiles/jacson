Write a project report describing recent mathematical and statistical results, techniques, and applications to a readership of mathematics and statistics graduates. The exposition will show the student can (1) Use rigorous mathematical argument, draw conclusions from empirical evidence, and efficiently implement mathematical and statistical techniques as appropriate. (2) Explain ideas clearly making appropriate use of examples, counter-examples, special cases, graphs, tables, and visualisation techniques. (3) Place results in the context of the development of the area, and compared alternative approaches. (4) Use appropriate referencing to original results and a consistent bibliographic style. (5) Write clearly in a consistent style and with good organisation."
