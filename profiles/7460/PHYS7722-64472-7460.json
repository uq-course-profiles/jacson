The default is that the Supervisor's mark and Examiner's mark should carry equal weight.</p>\n<p> In all project assessment, comparison should be made not with other students within the year, but with previous students and with standards at other Australian and overseas universities, having in mind that Masters results should reflect not only an assessment of achievements within the Masters year, but also a judgement on the potential of students to carry out independent research work in the future.</p>\n<p> Students are strongly urged to submit a draft of their report to their supervisor for feedback well before the due date!</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
