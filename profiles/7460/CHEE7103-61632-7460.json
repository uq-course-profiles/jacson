Essentially, this is an oral presentation with supporting visual aids (e.g. PowerPoint slides) of the <em>Executive Summary</em> in the Design Package 2 Team report.</p>\n<p>The final presentations are scheduled in blocks during examination period. Each team of students needs to only attend one block/session to present their work and listen to the presentation of up to 3 other teams.</p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>\n<p>Criteria &amp; Marking:</p>\n<p>Your team’s Final Presentation will be assessed by team mentors using the marking rubric. Each team watching a session will score the other teams presentations – this peer assessment is also a team activity and your team leader must submit your evaluations to the teaching staff member when you leave the presentation session. The mentors and course coordinator will consider the peer marks in awarding the final presentation mark.</p>\n<p>All team members will receive the same mark unless there are exceptional circumstances where an individual did not contribute.</p>\n<p>Penalty for not completing peer assessment:</p>\n<p>If your team doesn't submit peer assessments for the other team in your session, your team will have 2 points (from 10 points) deducted from your Final Presentation score.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to attend the Final Presentation at the scheduled time, please submit an extension request as per UQ Extension Policy. Your team will continue in the scheduled time, and approved alternative time examinations for final presentations will be arranged for individuals to present their assigned section and answer questions at a later date.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
