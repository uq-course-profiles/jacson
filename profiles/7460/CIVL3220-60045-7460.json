Some <strong>important</strong> information includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It will be assumed that you have studied the practical handout prior to your arrival in the laboratory, so you will be given minimal instruction.</li>\n<li>Many of the practical classes in this course involve the use of machines and equipment in a laboratory environment. For safety reasons suitable clothing and covered footwear must be worn during the practical class. Thongs and open type sandals are not regarded as safe footwear. Safety glasses must be worn at all times.</li>\n<li>Students must wear safety shoes, long sleeves and long pants to all practical sessions. Shorts and T-shirts are not acceptable and you won't be admitted to the practical class without the correct PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) - SAFETY FIRST is the rule at all times.</li>\n<li>It is a condition of entry to practical classes that you have completed the Student Safety Declaration Form provided by your tutors before the class. When you arrive at the practical venue, it is also compulsory to sign in, and sign out as you leave the laboratory. If you do not sign in and sign out, we will assume you have not attended the session.</li>\n<li>You must bring drawing instruments including: a protractor, ruler, and compass to the practical class. These drawing instruments will also be required for the rock mechanics exam.</li>\n<li>You will not have time to read through the laboratory handout during the laboratory session, so it is important you study the provided handouts prior to your session.</li>\n<li>Obey the instruction of your tutor and standard procedures relating to the mine (e.g. use of safety tag).</li>\n<li>Report all accidents or high potential incidents immediately.</li>\n<li>NO SMOKING, DRINKING OR EATING during practical sessions.</li>\n<li>During practical classes, students are to remain in the areas designated by the tutor all the times.</li>\n<li>Leave the laboratory or work area in a clean state.</li>\n<li>Always be sure of what you are doing. If not sure, ask your tutor.</li>\n<li>Report any malfunction or damage so that it may be rectified before the next laboratory period.</li>\n<li>The tutor is given the responsibility to ensure compliance with these rules. As such, he or she may require a student to leave a practical for non-compliance. A student asked to leave would then need to seek permission to attend the practical at a later time if approved by the Course Coordinator.</li>\n<li>All practical last a full 3 hours. Each series of practical sessions is designed to supplement the formal lectures in the subjects. Generally, experiments have been selected to illustrate material presented in the lecture course. However, some experiments involve topics, which cannot be presented effectively in the lectures.</li>\n<li>Students arriving more than 10 minutes late will not be permitted to start a practical. Students unable to attend a practical because of extenuating circumstances must contact the Course Coordinator to obtain written authorisation to attend another practical.</li>\n<li>A report cannot be submitted on the results of a practical which has not been attended by the student, unless approved by the Course Coordinator in written before the relevant practical session(s).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The prac exercises have been designed to provide an introduction to, and an awareness of, basic measurements and test procedures in rock mechanics. You will be provided electronic access to Rock Testing Lab Book. This Rock Testing Lab Book must be printed out and brought to both rock testing practical classes. You will need to access the appendices during prac so you need to print the whole book. Five rock tests will be carried out over two laboratory sessions. Students will carry out laboratory testing of supplied rock samples, record the results and report them in the provided Lab Book. Some analysis outside of laboratory time will be required. Submissions received after the due date (or extended due date) without prior agreement will not be marked. You should use the electronic form of the Lab Book as a template for your report.
