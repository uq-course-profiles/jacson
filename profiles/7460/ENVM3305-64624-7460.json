The impact may emerge from any stage of the mining life cycle (exploration to mine closure) and affect any environmental value (e.g. land, water, biodiversity, cultural heritage). The innovative approach may include efforts to minimise impacts (e.g. through applying new technologies to extract minerals, or modification of processing conditions to produce benign tailings) or to overcome impacts post-mining (e.g. development of seed germination techniques for rehabilitation). As it is a short presentation, you can be quite specific and narrow in focus, but you should give a clear description of the scientific principles involved and the evidence for the efficacy of this novel management approach.</p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions on key things to include in your presentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe the innovative approach to assessing or managing the impact, along with how, where and why it was developed and how successful has it been.</li>\n<li>Describe the environmental impact your approach seeks to address, describing where and how it occurs, and why assessing and managing it is a challenge.</li>\n<li>Evaluate its potential for broader application of this innovative approach (e.g. is it easy to implement, data intensive, expensive?) and give recommendations on how to address any remaining challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose a topic that interests you. In the third practical of semester (Week 3) run your proposed topic by one of the demonstrators so that we can limit overlap in topics among students and ensure your chosen topic is specific enough to meet all assessment criteria.</p>\n<p>The presentation will be judged on the breadth and quality of literature reviewed (be explicit about any knowledge gaps that limit understanding of the impact and its management) and the structure and content of PowerPoint slides. Please be sure to include references where appropriate and use reputable sources (journal articles, government and industry reports) rather than websites.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The assessment should cover all potential environmental impacts, including those to the atmosphere, waterways, soils, fauna, flora, visual amenity and cultural heritage. It should outline a detailed methodology for assessing the significance of these impacts for key stakeholder groups and propose a suitable management plan that could be developed pending the outcome of the impact assessment.</p>\n<p>The final report should be clearly structured (making use of sections, subsections, figures, tables and supplementary materials) and demonstrate familiarity with current literature and research methods relevant to identifying, assessing and managing environmental impacts of mining. Appropriate references must be used to support the proposed methodology and reasoning. There is no word limit, but the proposal should be no longer than 50 pages (30 pages is a rough recommended length). Marks will be distributed among group members based on a peer assessment process.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
