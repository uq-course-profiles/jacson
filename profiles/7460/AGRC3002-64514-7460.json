You are interested in developing agronomic systems that are well adapted to climate change that are likely to take place or is already taking place in your region. You need to consider which aspects of climate change (eg, increased temperature, increased frequency of drought, increased sea level causing salinity problem etc.) are an issue in the region. The key issues to be addressed in this assignment are, for a location of your choice, to describe climatic variability and climate change and discuss their likely overall impact as well as the specific effect of a particular aspect of climate change (eg flood occurrence) on crop productivity under the current cropping system, and possible agronomic modifications to maintain or even enhance crop productivity.</p>\n<p><strong>Your presentation should contain sections on:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quantification of climatic variability and likely climate change for a selected location,</li>\n<li>The potential impact on crop productivity under the existing agronomic practice of a main cropping system for the location and</li>\n<li>Modified agronomic methods for the location including at least 3 of the following items for the existing main cropping system or alternative cropping system; crop calendar, cultivation method, variety, fertilizer, plant population and weed control.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your report will be assessed based on the content for each of the tasks mentioned above.</p>\n<p>The assessment guidelines and marking criteria sheet can be found on the course blackboard site: <strong>Agronomists Report-Pre-recorded Presentation &amp; Marking Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

This assessment task is designed to encourage you to start making notes on field observations and or points that may be useful to reflect on at a later date. Photos are also an excellent way to get snapshots and records of what was observed for reference at a later date but these should always be accompanied by some notes. For the purpose of this activity no photos are required just notes and a summary of data to remind you what you were observing. Eg. 1/8/2019 Plant establishment counts in wheat were X% lower in the rainfed environment compared to the irrigated environment…..  </p>\n<p>The journal should include notes compiled from each of 4 practical session conducted throughout semester, field walks, shed meetings, entomology practical and reflections on any discussions had in practical sessions.</p>\n<p>Your compiled journal should consist of a maximum of one A4 (400 words) page per day/field visit (typed). Each days entries will be weighted equally. Compiled notes need to make logical sense when read in terms of flow of record keeping but doesn’t necessarily have to be all in sentence structure, ie dot points are acceptable for certain parts, but they must make sense to the reader as a summary of the observations/activities for the day. As a minimum entries should include: date, time, location, weather conditions (eg. cloudy, sunny, hot and dry), crop and crop status/development, observations, if an experimental site record whether treatment effects are apparent and what/how these appear. Writing should describe observations clearly and neatly. Descriptions should be unambiguous such that a person returning to the site could find the patterns described in your journal using your notes. Reflections need to briefly summarise material delivered, identify what was interesting and what you gained from the session (max 400 words/session).</p>\n<p>Marking criteria will be provided on blackboard.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
