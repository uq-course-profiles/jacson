You are to participate in an asynchronous discussion following the SOAP structure. How do you interpret the provided signs and symptoms and what differential diagnosis are you suspecting, justify why you suspect them. The discussion will then flow on to identify what diagnostic interventions you see as relevant and what you will achieve with them. When results are known, the discussion will focus on developing a problem list. The last step is to develop a management plan that addresses the problem list. All discussions will be monitored and moderated by the course coordinator. The agreed management plan has to be presented as a document on the <em>discussion board</em>. You will actively participate in your assigned group activity and discussion, and also read the information from the other group discussion activity.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
