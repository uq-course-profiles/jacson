In this report, you will be required to provide an overview of the current research and literature on teachers’ health work in school communities and advocate for ONE of the above projects. Your literature review should provide insight into the role of student health and wellbeing strategies in promoting inclusive student participation and engagement in learning.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>APST: 2.1, 4.1, 4.4, 7.1, 7.2</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
