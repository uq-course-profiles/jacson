You’ve just completed your training in medical affairs and you become aware that your company may potentially be about to breach a legal code, similar to that of a previous competitor case. So, the Board of Directors has asked for an urgent meeting with teams from R&amp;D, regulatory affairs, PV, compliance, and marketing and sales.</p>\n<p>You are to present a poster presentation of <strong>no more than 4 minutes; </strong>the presentation is to provide:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A basic overview of a historical case (product/company and nature of the complaint regarding the advertising/marketing).</li>\n<li>Explanation about the code/s that were breached. In addition, describe any sanction/s and fines that were put in place by regulators and how this could have been avoided. What other legal aspects (e.g. regulations) could be implicated in your allocated case? Are there other historical cases that can help inform your company?</li>\n<li>If the initial meeting with the board of directors concludes and it's found that there is likely to be a breach of code, then name THREE key stakeholders that you’d like to have onboard for future meetings. How might this task group help your company avoid damaging commercial impact?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will also be asked a series of questions after your presentation (no more than 1 minute). Questions will be mostly general and asking for more detail.</p>\n<p>Poster style:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your poster should be presented as a SINGLE PowerPoint slide for projection as an e-poster. The slide must contain no movies, transitions or animations, i.e. the slide is static.  </li>\n<li>The poster must contain a clear title.   </li>\n<li>The bottom left-hand corner of your poster must contain your name.  </li>\n<li>Where possible the use of tables, diagrams and/or images to explain concepts is encouraged. Minimising the quantity of text and use of bullet points also strongly encouraged. </li>\n<li>Consider the viewer's ability to read the poster when selecting font size, style and images. </li>\n<li>Bring the PowerPoint compatible slide on a USB drive for submission at the start of the presentation session. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This oral assessment will be recorded and retained as per university policy. The recording will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed if required for the purposes of moderation of marking; provision of feedback to the student; and/or re-marking following a successful re-mark application.</p>\n<p>See Blackboard for more details.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
