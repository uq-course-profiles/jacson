Students are required to complete the pre-class reading and the associated workbook tasks and submit via the submission link on the course blackboard. This assessment item covers core themes and concepts discussed in the course and are designed to provide the foundations of topics we will explore in more detail in the online modules and then consider in an applied way in the tutorials. In the tutorial each week we will run feedback activities within groups aimed at giving students the opportunity to critically review their responses based on deeper consideration of the topics and through application of this knowledge. In line with this, students should also <em>bring a copy of their submission to the tutorial each week</em> to assist with the critical review and feedback activities that will be run. Students are then strongly encouraged to revise their submissions based on clearer or deeper understandings that may arise from these discussions. Following tutorials, students are strongly encouraged to edit and revise their workbooks. This revised work will then be compiled for the two final workbook compilations (see below). </p>\n<p>The tutorials and workbooks are at the core of learning in this course. As such, <strong>Tutorials are compulsory</strong> - non-attendance at a tutorial and/or non submission of a weekly workbook <strong>will incur a 5 mark penalty </strong>on the relevant final workbook compilation. </p>\n<p><strong>Workbook Compilation I:</strong> The first 2 responses, are to be submitted online as <strong>a single file</strong> to the course Blackboard site on the set date. This file will constitute your Workbook Compilation Part I and your marks and feedback from this assessment task will ensure you are meeting the learning objectives of the course. Workbook I is worth 25% and is <strong>due Friday Sept 6th at 2pm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Workbook Compilation II:</strong> The remaining workbook responses, are to be submitted to the course Blackboard site as a single file on the due date. This file will consitute your Workbook Compilation Part II which is worth 35%. <strong>This is due Friday Oct 25th at 2pm.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
