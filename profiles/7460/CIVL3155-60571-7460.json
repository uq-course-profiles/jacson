The aim is to provide feedback on students' learning of the concepts that underlie the course content and exam questions. Solutions to the CAFS questions are provided after the quizzes and students are welcome to discuss them further in tutorials and contact sessions. Assessment will be by Multiple Choice Questions, using polling via TurningPoint (also called Point Solutions) responseware (virtual \"clickers\" on mobile phone, tablet or browser). The quiz will be run live over Zoom and TurningPoint, during scheduled lecture sessions.</p>\n<p>Students may work in pairs or small groups.</p>\n<p>Final marks will be based on the scores for the best 2 out of 3 quizzes to account for one off technology issues or absence. Re-weighting of marks will apply if more than one quiz is missed for approved reasons. Dates for CAFS classes are given in the lecture schedule on Blackboard, but are subject to change (at least one week notice of a change will be given).</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
