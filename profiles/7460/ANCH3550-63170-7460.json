The aim of a pitch is to persuade a stakeholder such as an employer, prospective client, collaborator, or funding body that your project is viable, achievable (e.g. in terms of timeline and resources), and ultimately worthy of their support. It also provides a stakeholder with the opportunity to offer their valuable feedback. </p>\n<p>The stakeholders eager to support your project are the ANCH3550 Course staff. They have established a not-for-profit foundation with the aim of making the course content of ANCH3550 accessible to as many different audiences as possible, so that collectively, we can inspire positive and innovative change in the modern world through knowledge of the past.</p>\n<p> Your role is to create a pitch which will convince your stakeholders not only that you have plans for a clearly defined project website based on ANCH3350 course themes and materials, but also that you have both identified the persona you will use on the website (e.g., as an Ancient History academic expert, inspirational educator, influencer, blogger) and chosen an appropriate target audience. Your pitch must also outline the formats you will use to share your high-quality content.</p>\n<p> Ultimately, your pitch should demonstrate how you will use your workplace-transferrable skills in planning, research, organisation of data, communication, and digital literacy acquired and/or developed through studying Ancient History at UQ and in ANCH3550 to bring the project to completion.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Word Length: </strong>750 words</p>\n<p><em>Further information will be available on Blackboard under the Assessment Tab</em></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates a student's abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
