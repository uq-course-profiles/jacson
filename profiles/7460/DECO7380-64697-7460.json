A detailed assessment brief will be provided on Blackboard. You will do this using the Studio 3 Wiki platform where you will create and maintain a Design Journal page alongside your Studio Portfolio on which you keep a record of your work as you go through the semester. These journal pages will be reviewed by the teaching team on a regular basis as part of weekly report-back in class to make sure that all students are making progress. If you are found to not be updating your page appropriately, this will trigger a closer engagement with the teaching team to make sure that you are not putting yourself at risk of failing the course.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In Studio 3 where we do not have a final examination, this assessment item plays a similar role, where you are required to demonstrate what you have learned across the whole course.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of a portfolio in a design course is for you to gather together examples and evidence of the work that you have done throughout the course. Traditionally, portfolios are collections of work that individuals can share with prospective employers or potential collaborators as examples of the work that they have done. In a course like DECO7380, the work you contribute to your team's outcome will be heavily influenced by your skills and background, as well as by the nature of the project you have worked on. The contents of your portfolio might therefore include design work related to any number of things, including: project inspirations from existing products or services; user research to learn more about the context of use; sketches and schematics relating to data structures; visual designs of interface elements; reports on technology spikes; code snippets to explore functionality, etc.</p>\n<p>A studio portfolio will show off not only what work you have done, but also what you learned as a result of doing it. This reflective component is important so that you can demonstrate deeper learning. Your reflections will feature in this studio portfolio through a combination of how you provide a commentary on the work that you are featuring, along with the inclusion of a reflection section accompanying each topic covered in the portfolio. The reflection will be an opportunity for you to connect the work you have collected for display with what you have learned through working on it.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
