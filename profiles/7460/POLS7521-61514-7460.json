The report should be an essay reflecting on your field experience in terms of your role in an organisation that has an overarching purpose but confronts challenges and limitations that may be organisational, political, financial, or of another relevant type. You are not expected to advance an argument, as you would for a research paper, but you should place your experience in the context of what you have learned during your course work. This involves drawing upon some of the theoretical and practical approaches that you have studied and applying them to your field experience. A minimum of five (5) academic or policy-related texts should be used in the essay. This could include scholarly articles of an academic nature that provide a framework for thinking about organisational constraints, for example, or legislation or your organisation's publications that act as evidence for the constraints or purpose that you adduce in your report. </p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
