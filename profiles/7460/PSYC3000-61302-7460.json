The issue should be real, and verifiable within reason. Once identified, you will design an intervention to address the performance issue. The intervention must have strong psychological component, but a multidisciplinary approach is encouraged.</li>\n<li>You will nominate someone from your group to submit a 1-page document (no longer) summarising the underlying cause of the performance issue, as well as any precipitating factors, perpetuating factors, timeline &amp; logistics, and intended outcomes.

Once they have a job in their field, the only sport psychology readings to which they tend to regularly have access are articles published in applied/practical magazines or on online platforms. The first part of this assignment requires you to critically evaluate one of these articles. You need to determine if these readers are getting clear, understandable, correct, and useful information. The second half of this assignment requires you to write an applied/practical article of your own using theoretical principles and practical psychological skill information. It must be on a different topic than the article that you review, but written for the same magazine. All topics must be approved by your tutor before you begin.</p>\n<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>\n<p>Part 1: Select an applied sport psychology article from a digital or print magazine (e.g., The Conversation, The Society Pages, Australian Golf Digest, Ironman, Soccer International, Australian Tennis Magazine, Triathlon &amp; Multisport, Blitz Martial Arts Magazine). The article must be directly related to psychology (articles about physical technique are to be avoided). The article must be published within the last 12 months. Because you are being given a free choice of what article you choose, you must include a copy of the article with your assignment. In a maximum of 500 words you need to summarise the main points of the article, determine whether the writing of the article is clear and understandable (e.g., uses terminology relevant to the particular sport), and lastly support your opinion as to whether or not the article would be useful to the reader.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Keeping in mind your review of the article you read, you now need to write a practical or applied article of your own. The article may be on any practical topic in sport psychology. The article you write may NOT be on the same topic as the article you read, however, it must be written for the same magazine. The article must be simply written, practical, and aimed at a lay readership, but it must be scientifically sound and accurate. The article you write must contain no more than 750 words.</p>\n<p>Format of Complete Assignment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Double space</li>\n<li>Number pages</li>\n<li>Your critique should follow the citation of the article in proper APA7 format</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
