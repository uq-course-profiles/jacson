The topics will be accompanied by some <strong>prompting or guiding questions to help you write your essay.</strong> Answering these questions is <strong>not</strong> mandatory, they are included just to guide you (more information about topics and readings on Bb).</p>\n<p><strong>b) </strong>You must apply <strong>critical reasoning</strong> to build your essay on the topic you select. One of the mechanisms for developing and visualising critical reasoning is an <strong>argument map or mind-map</strong>, which can be <strong>executed manually or computationally (using </strong><a href=\"https://coggle.it/\">Coggle</a> <strong>maps</strong>). The 'map' will be inserted to your essay (as an image or graph). This aspect of your essay is important and has a value <strong>(5/40 pts)</strong> which will be marked on the essay rubric (more on this on Blackboard). Please, include it in your paper in the introduction, theory section, or appendix. The words in the argument map <strong>will</strong> <strong>not</strong> be included in the word count. There will be exercises in tutorials about this task.</p>\n<p><strong>d) </strong>Develop a <strong>well-supported argument that is critical and may engage (if relevant) with potentially problematic cultural or ethical issues. </strong>This argument will be supported on (d.1) some of the academic, peer-reviewed, recommended readings; (d.2) professional literature (from digital media professional websites and/or reports from well-known communication/media/market research companies - Some of them provided on Learning Resources); (d.3) a real life example of a brand, company, organisation, or institution using digital media or AI tools or assets in public spaces (news media, social media, owned media, event). The idea is that you link some or all these elements to build your argument.</p>\n<p><strong>To achieve a passing grade of 20 or above you must include a minimum of three academic references and use at least two professional resources (websites, reports, or others) which should be also referenced</strong>. Use <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">APA 7th referencing style </a> to cite the material. Please <strong>note that citations alone are not considered sufficient</strong>. Students must demonstrate that they have indeed<strong> read, used, and engaged with the cited material</strong> by, for example, providing some short quotations (direct or paraphrased) from some of the works cited to develop their argument on the chosen topic. The essay will be practiced in tutorials.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' <strong>human capabilities to (a) learn and understand theory, (b) search for themes and real-life examples relevant to a specific topic, (c) connect these items with theory, and (d) find patterns</strong> <strong>without</strong> <strong>the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</strong> <strong>Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct</strong> under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It will be informed by weekly activities (during lectures and workshops), and also the feedback you obtained from your tutors for assignment 2.</li>\n<li><strong>The pieces of content your will plan and produce for your portfolio strategically aim to build online engagement, impact, and expertise for our client</strong>. The content should be <strong>data-driven, memorable, meaningful, and newsworthy</strong>. The task will be developed in groups (already self-enrolled on Bb for the Concept Plan)<strong>. </strong>The portfolio should showcase a rich multimedia immersive, blog-type (or news style) story, copy, or text that will include a set of digital elements/assets (in writing, visual, and/or audio format) that must be well-articulated and coherent. The portfolio will be produced using <a href=\"https://shorthand.com/\">Shorthand</a> (training will be facilitated in classes and online). </li>\n<li><strong>The story should have the potential to be deconstructed in various transmedia assets to be used via used in shared, earned, owned and paid media (e.g. posts, tiles, graphs, instastories). The Shorthand link (with password if any) must be copied to your report (and also to your Bb submission).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The portfolio submission will include</strong>:</p>\n<p>a) <strong>Text in the form of a</strong> <strong>story in blog post style </strong>(<strong>800 words</strong>) written using Shorthand. You will be telling a <strong>memorable, newsworthy, engaging story for your client. </strong>The story will strategically and effectively communicate/promote your client's message <strong>enhanced by digital tools to engage key audiences and build reputation/authority for your client</strong>. <strong>This story will include: Photo(s)</strong> - shot with your smartphone and/or professional equipment hired from MaPS; and/or taken from the client website, or free copyright websites;</p>\n<p>b) A <strong>90 seconds to 2 min-video</strong> (could be broken for example into two 1' videos) - shot and edited with your smartphone or professional equipment hired from MaPS; you may also use material from your client's website or free copyright sites (music, videos, animation);</p>\n<p>c) An <strong>infographic or fact sheet with relevant information</strong>. Other type of graph(s) or statistics may be included.</p>\n<p>d) All these items should be articulated in the <strong>Shorthand story’s layout; however, some assets may be submitted separately to Bb for better visualisation </strong>(if distorted on Shorthand). You will also suggest the use of the content you produce on other platforms (website, microsite, and/or social media platforms).</p>\n<p><strong>Separately, via Blackboard (which allows uploading multiple docs) you will also submit the following pieces</strong>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Video script(s)</strong> - approx. <strong>300 words</strong> (you may also include a <strong>podcast script</strong> if applicable; chat with the course coordinator);</li>\n<li><strong>One-week media calendar (approx. </strong>200 words). Calendar must be relevant to the project and consistent with dates provided by the client (if any).</li>\n<li><strong>A 700-word Report</strong> that outlines and justifies the multimedia content strategy that you created to respond to the brief. This is an important part of the assignment. The Report will briefly describe the strategic process that led you to produce the multimedia content in the Portfolio and explain why this content is <strong>potentially effective </strong>to fulfil your client’s digital content needs. Finally, briefly discuss (just a few lines) any cultural, legal, or ethically relevant issues that may (or may not) be involved in the project. Cite any supporting material (use APA 7th). Include a cover page with the group names, title of the portfolio, make it visually appealing and consistent with the client’s look and feel, and a reference list at the end (these elements will not be included in the word count). <strong>The text in the report is different from the text in your Shorthand story</strong> (these are two different items).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 1</strong>: If you cannot, or do not want to produce a video, and a<em>fter consultation with the course coordinator,</em> you may develop instead a 1-2-min informative (<em>flash briefing</em>) podcast using your smartphone or MaPS' audio studio facilities. You will embed this podcast(s) in your Shorthand. <strong>You may also develop both, video and podcast</strong> but just if you are familiar with these techniques. Mixed media assets or texts are welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 2</strong>: Class time will be spent on developing the skills required to create the portfolio. It is important that your take training or workshops provided by MaPS from week 2 onwards (e.g., Video production and editing; Photography, Audio Recording, etc. - see Bb for Calendar and registration in O week). InDesign and WordPress may also help. MaPs offerings in semester 2 will be posted to Bb, Learning Resources in week 1. You can use resources available via <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training/linkedin-learning-online-courses\">LinkedIn Learning Online Courses</a> (UQ Library); Shorthand and Adobe Suite (both available to UQ students). The use of <strong>Canva </strong>is also recommended for infographics, fact sheets, and calendars.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 3:</strong> groups <strong>will informally pitch their portfolios' in workshops (5/6 mins per group) in week 12 to receive feedback one week before final submission</strong>. Note that you will present just some of the main assets, <strong>NOT the full portfolio)</strong> Presentations will be coordinated with your tutors. More information relevant to this task will be posted to Bb. Pitches will be assessed by tutors in the oral presentation and be part of the 'Multimedia Content' item in the rubric <strong>(2 pts). More information on Bb.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 4: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' <strong>human creativity, capabilities and knowledge preferably without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As we are aware that some digital tools involve AI generated assets/material, students are advised that a generalised and intentional use of AI technologies to develop this assignment may constitute student misconduct</strong> <strong>under the Student Code of Conduct</strong>. If for specific reasons you feel tempted or compelled to use AI generated material for one of the items in the portfolio, you must consult with the course coordinator and tutor (in person and in writing), explain your reasons, and, if accepted, <strong>reference it in your work</strong> (via caption or footnote); also reference, explain, support, and justify any AI use use in the Report section, as <strong>otherwise student misconduct may apply. Your human creativity is crucial for this assignment. </strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
