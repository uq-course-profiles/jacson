The presentations will be recorded as part of the standard Echo360 recording of the class. The presentations will be availble on Blackboard for all students to see when they open the lecture recording.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Component 2: Written Reflection (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>Each student is expected to write a 900 (plus or minus 100) word critique of the process of preparing the presentation. This is done individually (even if you worked on the presentation as a pair) and is due by 2pm on the day immediately before your presentation (i.e. Wednesday). In this critique I need you to answer (based on the literature and the theoretical approach) the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What background research did you do? (Don't just list the items that you read, tell me how they helped you to create your presentation)</li>\n<li>Why did you choose the case study you chose?</li>\n<li>What other case studies did you consider and why did you reject them?</li>\n<li>What elements of the theory does the case study you chose particularly illustrate?</li>\n<li>Where did you get the images for the PowerPoint?</li>\n<li>If you worked in pairs how was the workload distributed?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Component 3: Critical Engagement/Participation (8%)</strong></p>\n<p>Each week you are expected to participate as an audience member during other students' presentations by asking questions or making comments based on the readings and your knowledge of the theory.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

To make this assignment managable for yourself, you should select one theoretical perspective (it doesn't have to be from this list) and just use that. You will also need to illustrate it with at <strong>at least two archaeological science case studies</strong>. You <strong>cannot </strong>use the same case study/ies you included in your presentation assignment.</p>\n<p>The target audience for your poster is a conference of theoretical archaeologists.</p>\n<p>To answer the question start with the set readings from the course and then you are expected to research beyond those set readings to create your answer. Find case studies in your additional research to help you illustrate points that you want to make. The answer is to be presented as a poster.</p>\n<p>Your poster will be A3 in size and coloured. It also has to be accompanied by a single A4 page containing your information sources including references and image sources. Submit your poster as a pdf through Turnitin on Blackboard. Do not submit a hardcopy of the poster.</p>\n<p>For information on creating a poster you can google \"creating a poster in Powerpoint\". There are many websites that provide advice. </p>\n<p>We will also spend time in week 7 of the course running through the requirements for this assignment and the basics of setting up Powerpoint to make a poster.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use:</strong> This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
