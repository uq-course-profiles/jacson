You will consider the case of a 1-month-old child for whom you have just completed an audiological assessment. This assessment included a full case history, auditory brainstem responses, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, and otoacoustic emissions. The full details for this case are presented in the Case Study folder in the Assessment section of the AUDL7123 Course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Your task for the case report assessment is to <strong>write three (3) documents:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>An audiological report for the child. </strong>Your audiological report is to be addressed to the child’s Family Doctor. It must include pre-amble, case history, test results, impressions, and recommendations, and be written with the target reader in mind. There is no word limit for this report, although its length should reflect the need for clear and concise writing in audiology reports.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>A letter presenting to the parents of the child. </strong>Your letter is to be addressed to the child's parents. It must include pre-amble, introduction, body, and conclusion, and be written with the target readers in mind. It must not include formal referencing (e.g., in-text citations and a reference) but can include informal referencing (e.g., web page addresses) if desired. There is no word limit for this letter, although its length should reflect the need for clear concise writing when communicating with parents.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>A short essay justifying your audiological report. </strong>This critical essay is to be presented in academic style. It must include an introduction, body, conclusion, and referencing (in-text and reference list) in American Psychological Association format, version 7. In your essay, you must justify your reporting of the child's audiological test results. For example, if you reported the ABR results were consistent with a particular degree of hearing loss, then you will need to argue how you came to this conclusion. Your arguments must be referenced to professional and scientific literature where possible. The maximum word count allowed for the essay is 1000 including all words in the introduction, body, conclusion, and appendices (if used). This count includes words in the in-text citations but not words in the essay title or reference list. You will be penalized and absolute value of 10% for the whole case study if you exceed this word limit (e.g., if you scored 80% for the whole case study but your word count for the essay was 1001, then your score for the whole case study would be reduced to 70%).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
