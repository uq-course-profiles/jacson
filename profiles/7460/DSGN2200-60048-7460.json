In Assessment Task 1 (A01), students investigate successful case studies of various organisations—commercial, non-profit, and community-driven—that address wood-based products EOL from a circular design perspective. This analysis helps identify gaps and opportunities for similar organisations that operate in the current Australian timber construction market, aiding them in transitioning to a circular economy (CE) model through the adoption of 'Rs' strategies.</p>\n<p>In teams of four, students will redefine EOL scenarios for a real-life timber building and accordingly propose a transformative business/organisation structure for a wood-based product EOL organisation to enable its transition to a CE within the timber construction industry. This involves identifying an innovative and relevant focus for the proposed organisation within a defined scope, demonstrating a thorough understanding of key stakeholders, and developing effective design strategies, tools, and outputs to enable the organisation's circularity goals.</p>\n<p>The outputs for are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Weekly outputs - </strong>10% (to be submitted via padlet on the day before class in weeks 2 - 6, by 4pm)</p>\n<p>Through structured studio sessions, students in their groups will engage in critical reading and discussions, along with background research. Students will collaborate to produce weekly outputs allowing them to progress towards their final submission.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Industry Pitch</strong> Verbal Presentation to industry in class (Week 6) for formative feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Design Process Report</strong> (curated booklet)</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
