This assessment will be comprised of four laboratories:</p>\n<p>- Laboratory 1 (10%): This lab consists of two parts, namely three-phase load measurement (Part I: 5%) and Transformer testing (Part II: 5%). The laboratory will be conducted face-to-face during scheduled laboratory sessions, week 4-7 (specific session allocations will be provided on the course blackboard). Check the course blackboard page for specific deadlines and other details. There is no need to submit a separate report for laboratory 1, both parts will be assessed and marked in the lab. Due date: Sept. 13.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the laboratories (Lab 2-4) students will write reports individually based on the experimental data given and submit them via the course blackboard page.</p>\n<p>- Laboratory 2 (5%): Induction Machines. Due date: Sept. 20</p>\n<p>- Laboratory 3 (5%): Synchronous Machines. Due date: Oct. 11</p>\n<p>- Laboratory 4 (5%): DC Machines.
