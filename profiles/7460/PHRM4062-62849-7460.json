Each Student must attend and complete their Placement for <strong>4 (four) consecutive weeks and at least 150 hours in their Placement pharmacy during Weeks 1 to 4 of Semester 2. </strong>Any alterations to the set timeframe must be discussed with the Course Coordinator and approved prior to the Placement.</p>\n<p>All Students are expected to be available to <strong>commence classes in other Year Four Courses in Week 5, as per their individual timetable</strong>.</p>\n<p>The start and finish time each day will depend on the agreement between the Student and their Preceptor. If the Placement includes a public holiday relevant to that Placement site, the Students are expected to attend/not attend the placement site in accordance with usual practice at that site e.g. if the facility is not open during the public holiday then the Students do not attend and that time is included within the 150 hours.</p>\n<p>It is expected that students will attend their experiential placement sites on a full-time basis from Monday to Friday over the 4 consecutive weeks of the placement period. In the case of illness, students are NOT expected to attend their placement and should inform their Preceptor and The School Office (<a href=\"mailto:pharm.studentadmin@uq.edu.au\">pharm.studentadmin@uq.edu.au</a>) as soon as possible. Students away from their placement site for greater than TWO days due (i.e. on the third day) to illness should obtain a medical certificate and provide this to the School Office and their Preceptor.</p>\n<p>Students are advised to contact the Course Coordinator to notify of any prolonged absence (greater than THREE days) from the placement site due to illness. Additionally, irrespective of medical certificates, any cumulative absence over the 4 week period longer than 3 days must be immediately brought to the attention of the Course Co-ordinator.</p>\n<p><strong>PRECEPTOR'S CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT ATTENDANCE AND EVALUATION OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE</strong></p>\n<p>The Preceptor's confirmation that the Student has attended their placement and their evaluation of their performance during the Placement are each compulsory components of this course. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Throughout the Placement, Students are expected to seek guidance and constructive feedback from their Preceptor. This is how they will know how they are progressing and/or if they need to approach anything differently.</li>\n<li>Students are encouraged to meet with their preceptor (about mid-way through the placement) to discuss their progress, using the SPA form to guide the discussion. Students can use the SPA Form as many times as they like during the Placement, to initiate, guide and inform discussions with the Preceptor, at a mutually suitable time. These SPA forms would be 'formative' submissions to allow feedback and would not be the final evaluation of the student.</li>\n<li>Towards the end of the placement period (e.g. from Wednesday of the last week) the student should upload at least ONE scanned copy of their formative SPA form to the link on Blackboard (under the Assessment tab) entitled \"Formative SPA Form Submission Link\" </li>\n<li>The student will be prompted to submit to their preceptor via the ePortfolio </li>\n<li>This process will then trigger an email to the Preceptor that will allow them to complete the final 'summative' student evaluation via an electronic SPA form and allow them to confirm student attendance for 4 consecutive weeks full time </li>\n<li>This email that the Preceptors will receive will have in the subject line: \"Work Assessment from UQ ePortfolio - Surname (of student), Firstname (of student)\".</li>\n<li>*please note - the 'Surname' and 'First name' will appear as they are in Blackboard, i.e. there will be no preferred names, nicknames, etc. </li>\n<li>The Preceptor will indicate their confirmation of your placement attendance as well as their evaluation of your Placement performance as either Needs Attention, Developing, or Satisfactory across several criteria outlined on the SPA Form.</li>\n<li>The Course Coordinator will review these evaluations and take necessary action where/if needed.</li>\n<li>The final decision regarding the overall Pass or Fail mark for this assessment component of the course will be made by the Course Coordinator, in discussion with the Preceptor. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students are able to confirm submissions and review pending or marked submissions by using the 'My Results' section inside the UQ ePortfolio, or by viewing if the item is indicated to have been submitted in the top right hand side corner of the submission page. Students will be able to view the mark in 'My results' once the mark has been released. The result will appear as 'pending' prior to the mark release. Once marked, the mark will appear as N/A since it has no numerical value. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
