The topic will be agreed upon primarily between the student and the advisor, although the advice of the course co-ordinator may also be sought in this matter. Students are <strong>strongly </strong>urged to follow carefully the advice of the advisor (and course co-ordinator, if applicable, in relation to the matter of topic formulation. Outcomes are much less likely to be satisfactory in cases where the student's topic gives cause for reservation with the advisor.</p>\n<p>For matters relating to presentation, the student should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>follow the advice of their advisor;</li>\n<li>consult the <a href=\"https://music.uq.edu.au/files/16914/music-academic-writing-guide.pdf\">School of Music Academic Writing Guide</a></li>\n<li>review previous theses that are recommended by the advisor or course co-ordinator as exemplary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the deadline for submitting a complete draft of the thesis to your advisor for final review is Friday in Week 12 of Semester Two. Advisors cannot guarantee to read your final draft with sufficient attention after this time as well as have it returned to you with sufficient time for you to take meaningful action on suggestions. (Of course, it is expected that you will have been submitting material throughout the year regularly). Advisors are not obliged to read and respond to lengthy written material after this time.</p>\n<h3>Additional Comments on the Thesis</h3>\n<p>Many but not all academic theses follow this standard structure - but note that specific topics may warrant modified approaches. Please consult with your advisor about the appropriate format for your thesis.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that the following elements are usually deemed essential to the production of an academic thesis:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Stating rationale and/or purpose of study, as well as outlining and elaborating the research topic/question.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Body</strong></p>\n<p>Usually a number of chapters, comprising, among various possible elements: an examination of current research and related literature to the central purpose of the study leading to relevant research questions and hypotheses (effectively, a literature review); application of a valid research method and approach to address the principal questions or hypotheses, statement of results and discussion of the findings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Synthesising the main aspects of the study. The discussion and anticipation of further study demonstrate an awareness of the implications and further application of the findings in a broader context.</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Students should download the template that is provided to students in the PGCW Community Blackboard Site and use this to prepare the final draft for submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong></p>\n<p>You are required to use 12pt font size, Times New Roman and 1.5 spacing.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
