Entry-level students have access to the Social Change Academy and the learning that occurs though the academy stays with them as they progress through their careers. The vision for The Social Change Academy is that the knowledge, understanding, and skills developed through the academy will shape the ways in which occupational therapists of the future will practice and have flow-on effects for our most disadvantaged and vulnerable client groups. In previous years, the social change academy included video descriptions of occupational injustices. In 2024, your informational graphics will be downloaded by course staff and added to the Social Change Academy site for future students to view and use in preparation for examination in the first year of their studies.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>See the Task Description File on Blackboard.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
