State what that career may be up front!! I want to know why corals reefs are relevant for your future. </p>\n<p>II.              You are to write a summary of each of the topics below (using professional grammar and scientific style) relating to Heron Reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef. <strong>Do not use ChatGPT or other online tools</strong>, as it is important for you to be able to express yourself with this material. Use at least three references for each topic and present them using the format shown below. You will need to investigate the literature concerning the Capricorn–Bunker groups of the southern Great Barrier Reef, focusing primarily on Heron Reef, where your field studies will occur. Although you may reference previous summaries, such as Jell &amp; Flood (1978) and Jell &amp; Webb (2012) as guides, you will be expected to focus on literature after 2013 so as to be up-to-date. The following topics should be covered:</p>\n<p>1.     General setting</p>\n<p>2.     Local climate</p>\n<p>3.     Remote sensing maps</p>\n<p>4.     Reef ecology</p>\n<p>5.     Reef sediments</p>\n<p>6.     Subsurface geology</p>\n<p>7.     Geophysical data</p>\n<p>8.     Cay formation</p>\n<p>9.     Cay biology (plants and birds)</p>\n<p>10.  Anthropogenic history of Heron Island/Reef </p>\n<p>This project will require library work and not just internet searches. The document should be typed in 12 point font, and 1.5 line spacing. The references for each heading should follow the appropriate paragraph and be listed in alphabetical order by first author and then by date for the same author. Complete references are required, meaning authors, date, title, journal, volume and page numbers. Use the following format as an example (but you need only have three references):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong># Palaeoclimate</strong></p>\n<p>Understanding palaeoclimate is critical for understanding and predicting the reactions of modern reef communities to past environmental change (Webb, 2024). Such data are commonly retrieved by studying cores of long-lived coral colonies (Thompson, 2022) and cores through entire reefs (Jell and Webb, 2012; Salas-Saavedra et al., 2018), such as the Heron Island Bore of 1937 (Richards &amp; Hill, 1942).

The report should be structured in the following format:</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.              Title</strong></p>\n<p>2.              <strong>Abstract </strong>An abstract should contain a brief (200 word) summary including, aims, methods, some results and conclusion with significance/implications.</p>\n<p>3.              <strong>Introduction</strong> This should rely heavily on your previous report. It could be written before going to Heron Reef! It should cover the following areas and include a location map.</p>\n<p> <strong>Location</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Aims</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Previous work</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Regional setting</strong></p>\n<p>4.              <strong>Methods</strong> (These should come from your field notes and instructions provided on the reef.)</p>\n<p><strong>5.              Results</strong></p>\n<p><strong>General description of zonation across Heron Reef, including the distribution of sediment, ecological communities and physical data </strong>(You will need to have access to the group map in order to do this description, so be sure that you make a copy (photograph) of the map while on Heron Reef)</p>\n<p> <strong>Characteristics of each zone</strong> (including topography, cover, coral communities and sediments – use the data from your traverses)</p>\n<p> <strong>Nature of boundaries between zones </strong>(based on your descriptions as recorded in your notebook)</p>\n<p> <strong>One individual sediment sample </strong>(document your sediment sample composition in detail, but then include the data from all groups in the report for analysis if possible)</p>\n<p>\tWhile on Heron Island each group will conduct granulometric analyses on six sediment samples, three from each traverse (three North side and three South side). Everyone should take a turn at all parts of the analysis and each group member is responsible for one sample. Each individual will carry out a rough compositional analysis of one or two sediment samples from the group traverses so that all are analysed. Composition should be determined by grain counting for all coarse sediment fractions (down to 0 to 1 phi or so). Each of the six samples must be done. This will provide data on both grainsize and composition that can be compared to ecological and physical data gathered on the traverses. The report should contain data for each sample, including grain size (Wentworth Scale), basic parameters, like rounding, and sorting, and composition for your group, and then overall data from all groups. Raw data for your sample should be included as tables and cumulative frequency graphs with all grain size parameters determined for each sample. Other graphs and plots can be shown to compare all samples.</p>\n<p>\tAdditional data that can be included are the hydrodynamic information from waves and tides collected from the southern reef flat while in the field and beach survey data. These data can help inform your understanding and interpretation of the processes acting in the habitat zones (see Processes producing zonation below) and the sediment composition and granulometric data.</p>\n<p><strong>6.              Interpretation and discussion </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Test the four key hypotheses based on the maps and any provided air photos:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a.     The reef flat zonation provided in Jell and Webb (2012) can be observed north and south of Heron Island.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The reef flat zonation on Heron Reef is the same both north and south of the cay.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The reef flat zonation on Heron Reef has remained constant since the time of Jell and Flood’s (1978) paper.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Heron Island has not moved or changed size or shape since 1978.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Also discuss the following:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Relation of Hypothesis Map to Interpretation map</strong> – Be sure to explicitly state how your interpretation zonation relates to your data and how it may differ from the hypothesis map and discuss the potential reasons for any differences. Use evidence from your data – such as placement of zonation boundaries in relation to your cover data.</p>\n<p><strong>Processes producing the zonation -</strong> Relate your data and the map to reef processes you have learned about throughout the semester and measured through the various survey techniques. (This will require you to integrate what you have learned doing assignments and in lectures before the field trip with what you have observed on the reef. So be sure to have your lecture notes and other resources for writing this section.)</p>\n<p>7.              <strong>Inferred internal carbonate facies distribution - (</strong>include a N-S cross section to a depth of 50 m, based on your traverses on the western end of Heron reef and description of each facies, including texture, composition, and rock type – be sure to use proper limestone names). If you use vertical exaggeration on the drawing be sure to label it or provide both lateral and vertical scales. Be sure to use standard rock terminology for the limestones beneath the reef and discuss your interpretation in the text. Once you have observed modern reef processes and facies distributions on Heron Reef, you must integrate your knowledge of reef history and sea level change to determine what most likely lies beneath the surface. This is a critical skill for understanding and interpreting ancient reefs. (The cross section should be based on your data and understanding from the literature.)</p>\n<p>8.              <strong>Inferred changes associated with current/predicted environmental challenges </strong>– briefly discuss how the reef you have observed might change under predicted sea level rise, ocean acidification and coral bleaching scenarios. </p>\n<p>9.              <strong>Conclusions</strong> (Your conclusions should be based on <strong>your own data</strong>)</p>\n<p>10.           <strong>References</strong> (Follow the format of the Australian Journal of Earth Sciences, but do not capitalise all letters in author names.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The report is to be typed in 12-point font using 1.5 line spacing. Although there is no firm length limit, try to be concise and keep the report below 40 printed pages.</p>\n<p>Assessment will be based on: the quality and completeness of coverage; the degree to which <strong>your</strong> observations are interpreted in light of sound background information; the level of insight shown in analyses of the data collected during the trip; the overall integration of data from all groups and the literature; and the professionalism shown in the presentation. It is critical that you analyse your group’s data and discuss it in relation to the reef zonation and processes while on Heron Reef. Then, you can combine all groups’ data to improve your individual report. <strong>Please be advised that ChatGPT does not know what you will observe and so cannot help you write your report</strong>. <strong><em>Hurdle alert</em>:</strong> <strong>You must pass this assessment with a mark of 50% or better to pass the course!!</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
