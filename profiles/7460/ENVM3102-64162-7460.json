Formatting and Referencing Requirements</p>\n<p><strong>1. Preface</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this assessment item is to prepare a plan for your industry placement project. The Project Plan should detail the plan of approach for the project. It should be developed in consultation with your academic supervisor. It is a very important part of the industry placement process. Whilst the assessment task is not intended to be onerous, it is important to do well so that you have a clear plan for your project.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Project Plan Instructions, Format and Word Limits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each student is required to complete a ‘Project Plan’ using the format outlined in the table below.</li>\n<li>This is an individual assessment. Students must submit their own work.</li>\n<li>Students are to write and submit their Project Plan in their own document (word or pdf).</li>\n<li>Structure your Project Plan according to the template provided below (but not as a table), with each section titled with the Section heading listed in the table below.</li>\n<li>There is no word limit per se, but recommended word lengths for relevant sections are provided below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Project Plan Template</em></p>\n<p> <strong>Section</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Suggested Content</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Word Length</strong></p>\n<p>   1. What is the Title of your project?</p>\n<p> You can choose your own title. Good titles have meaning and give the reader insight into what the report is about. For example, <em>‘Assignment ENVM3102’</em> has no effective meaning, but this one does: '<em>A survey of frog species abundance and distribution in the upper parts of Oxley Creek Queensland'.</em></p>\n<p> No more than 30 words.</p>\n<p>   2. What is the Aim of your project? </p>\n<p> This should be one clear sentence that provides a succinct summary of what you report aims to achieve. For example, for the frog project noted above, the Aim could be: <em>What is the abundance and distribution of frog species in the upper parts of Oxley Creek Queensland?</em></p>\n<p> No more than 30 words.</p>\n<p>   3. What are the Objectives of your project?</p>\n<p> These should be written as no more than three specific Objectives that in effect, break the Aim down into manageable parts. For example:</p>\n<p><em>1. What is the abundance of frog species in the upper parts of Oxley Creek Queensland’?</em></p>\n<p><em>2. What is the diversity of frog species in the upper parts of Oxley Creek Queensland?</em></p>\n<p><em>3. What factors may be influencing the abundance and diversity of frog species in the upper parts of Oxley Creek?</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> No more than 30 words per Objective, no more than three Objectives.</p>\n<p>   4. How will your project have ‘Impact’?</p>\n<p> You should design your project so that it has pos</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Subject to commercial confidentiality constraints, your poster may be displayed at next year’s ‘Industry Placement Poster Showcase Event’ convened by the school, that will be attended by incoming Industry Placement students, host organisations and employers (past, current and future), UQ staff and your peers. It is a good opportunity to showcase your work. In those sorts of forums and events, Posters are a useful way of communicating your work. Good posters strike an effective balance between attention-grabbing graphics and important detail to engage browsing attendees at the event.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>2. Poster Instructions, Format and Word Limits</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each student is required to complete a ‘Poster’ as per the following instructions.</li>\n<li>This is an individual assessment. Students must submit their own work.</li>\n<li>For some tips on what makes a good scientific poster see:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/node/4290/4\">https://web.library.uq.edu.au/node/4290/4</a> (UQ Library)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://guides.nyu.edu/posters\">https://guides.nyu.edu/posters</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf\">https://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students should submit their poster in PowerPoint or PDF.</li>\n<li>Good quality posters do not just display thousands of words. They offer a concise summary, usually with some meaningful and compelling graphics, and work to attract and engage readers.</li>\n<li>There will be some examples of good posters from previous cohorts of the course available for your review on the course Blackboard site.</li>\n<li>Your poster should include:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The title of your project</li>\n<li>An introduction to your project highlighting why it is important</li>\n<li>A summary of your methods</li>\n<li>A summary of your results</li>\n<li>A summary of your recommendations and key findings</li>\n<li>Any relevant acknowledgements</li>\n<li>Your name</li>\n<li><br/></li>\n</ol>\n<p>3. Due Dates and Late Penalties</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The submission date is listed in the Course Profile.</li>\n<li>Extensions must be negotiated in advance of the due date.</li>\n<li>Late submissions must be approved by the Course Coordinator, or they will receive a grade of Fail.</li>\n<li><br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>4. Submission Method and Marking System</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This assignment is assessed as PASS/FAIL.</li>\n<li>The Course Coordinator may request students to revise and resubmit the assignment if it is incomplete, until it meets Pass standards (see criteria).</li>\n<li>Make your submission as a word document or pdf.</li>\n<li>Make your submission via the Turnitin link on the course blackboard page before the due date.</li>\n<li>Include your name on the poster.</li>\n<li><br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>5. Formatting and Referencing Requirements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whilst there is no specific formatting requirement for the post (you choose what you think is best for your project to achieve the purpose of the activity) please note the following advice from the UQ Library about how to format a good Poster</li>\n<li>The poster should be on A1 paper</li>\n<li>Use a 3 or 4 column format</li>\n<li>Try to keep 40% of the poster as white space, with no text or images. It helps organise the flow of information and prevents cluttering</li>\n<li>Keep a margin around the edge of the poster</li>\n<li>Use a large heading for your title across the top and sub-headings on your columns</li>\n<li>Text size recommendations</li>\n<li>Title heading 85 point font</li>\n<li>Subheadings 36 point</li>\n<li>Body text 24 point</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.clips.edu.au/posters/\">CLIPS website</a> has information on what to put in a science poster</li>\n<li>In PowerPoint <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-size-of-your-slides-040a811c-be43-40b9-8d04-0de5ed79987e\">Set the size of the slides</a> to the poster requirements before you start</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/save-powerpoint-presentations-as-pdf-files-9b5c786b-9c6e-4fe6-81f6-9372f77c47c8\">Convert your slide to a PDF</a> before you print it to keep the formatting as you intended.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/layout-and-composition-grids/designing-the-poster-grid?u=2340058&amp;auth=true\">Layout and Composition: Grids (LinkedIn Learning, 1h1m)</a> looks at how to use grids to create strong and consistent designs for posters.</li>\n<li>Don’t forget to include references and attributions.</li>\n<li>Try not to cut and paste illustrations from other sources.
