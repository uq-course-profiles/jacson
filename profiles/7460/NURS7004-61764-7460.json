The development of a Conceptual Framework for the Nurse Practitioner outlines the systemic process to ensure the essential elements of clinical practice, governance, evaluation, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n<p>The aim of this assessment is for you to build a Conceptual Framework to implement the role of a Nurse Practitioner within practice.
