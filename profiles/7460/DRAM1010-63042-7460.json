You must bring a copy of the relevant text (e-copies are acceptable) and any additional material to every tutorial, and you must have read the text at least once. From weeks 2-9, your participation grade is based upon your participation during class tutorials, while for weeks 10 and 11 we assess participation on the basis of 2 x 150-word written responses to the lecture topics, to be submitted within the relevant week to evidence your engagement with the last third of the course.
