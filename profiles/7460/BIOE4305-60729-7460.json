For example, one might say that the first telephone was an <em>invention</em>, the first cellular telephone either an <em>invention</em> or an <em>innovation</em>, and the first smartphone an <em>innovation.</em></li>\n<li>For a biomaterial employed in an implantable medical device, innovations may have happened in the chemistry, composition, structure (morphology), processing (manufacturing methods), design and surgical procedure or technique. This can extend further into methods of packaging, sterilization and storage etc.</li>\n<li>Much can be learned from device failures and recalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional Notes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly 5 pages limit for the body of the report. Table of contents, reference list, appendices, and title pages are not included in page count. Pages in the body of the report after page 5 will not be included in the grading assessment.</li>\n<li>You may include up to <strong>two half page figures</strong>. They must be relevant, referenced if appropriate, and utilised in the body of the text to improve communication with the reader.</li>\n<li>Plagiarism is in violation of UQ policy. The matter will also be passed to the School of Chemical Engineering for assessment, which may result in disciplinary action taken by the School.</li>\n<li>APA referencing style must be used throughout all assessment items in this course for all referencing, in-text references, and reference lists. Failing to reference completely may result in accusations of plagiarism, and marks will be lost for insufficient or incorrect referencing.</li>\n<li>Pages are to be formatted so that there is a 2 cm margins left and right, 2.5 cm header and footer. Text must be in professional font style of your choosing with a size equivalent to Times New Roman 12 pt. Paragraphs must have a 1.5 line spacing, 6 pt. spacing between paragraphs, no hanging indents, and alignment justified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
