The first task is to develop a comprehensive, culturally responsive, and evidence-based management plan to support the client’s transition and ongoing care in the community. Students will be required to: 1) assess and interpret case-based information related to a client with communication and swallowing impairments; 2) develop a culturally responsive management plan that addresses the client’s needs; 3) apply evidence-based practices in the creation of the management plan; 4) demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills in the context of community health care.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Part B requires students to complete a reflection task following attendance at the lived experience community showcase in Week 13. Students are required to provide a written reflection pertaining to the lived-experience of a community client that influenced understanding of challenges faced by individuals with communication disorders or gender-affirming communication care needs. The reflection must demonstrate a clear connection between the chosen client's lived-experience and an evolving approach to speech pathology service provision.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A detailed task description and marking criteria will be made available on the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
