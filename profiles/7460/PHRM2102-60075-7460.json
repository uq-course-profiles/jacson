            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>The oral consultation examination is a school-based exam that is scheduled during the examination period. The exam will likely run over two days; students will be notified of their allocated session via Blackboard prior to the exam revision period.</p>\n<p>The skills and competencies assessed at each station are mapped to Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) that will underpin your clinical placements as you progress through the degree.</p>\n<p><strong>Station One [Dispensing accuracy]</strong> in a dispensary setting <strong>[5 minutes; 5%]:</strong></p>\n<p>You will be presented with images of two dispensed items [2.5% each] showing: 1. the original prescription, 2. the printed label, and 3. the product.</p>\n<p>The scenario is you are completing a final check as the pharmacist. There is an error that you need to identity for each dispensing by writing it down on a blank sheet of paper that will be provided and handing your responses to the examiner at Station Two. No resources are allowed for Station one.</p>\n<p><strong>Station Two [A Medication history, B Resolving a medication-related problem, C Patient education]</strong> in a hospital setting [total 15 minutes]:</p>\n<p><strong>A. Medication history: Discussion with patient about their health and medication [5 minutes; 5%]:</strong></p>\n<p>Before a ward round, you decide to complete a full medication history for a newly admitted patient. Determine the use of existing and new medication/s. Ensure patient centred care (PCC) issues are raised including non-pharmacological aspects are ascertained such as difficulties with taking medications, lifestyle, cultural, and social. There are multiple patient centred care issues that are to be identified and addressed. You will be provided with the patient's medication chart so you can reconcile any discrepancy with the doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>B. Resolving a medication-related problem: Doctor (and patient) [5 minutes; 5%]:</strong></p>\n<p>At this station you are required to <strong>identify, explain, and discuss with a doctor</strong>, any potential clinical issues that are identified as the pharmacist. You will need to consider the patient's medicines from a medication chart; the new and all existing. A significant clinical issue will need to identified with the new medication only, there is only one new medication. Issues could include clarification of dose, appropriateness of dose, drug interactions, monitoring, appropriateness of therapy, therapy optimisation, contra-indications or precautions, and allergies and/or previous adverse drug reactions. You will need to prioritise any potential clinical issues and focus on just one - the most significant clinical issue. Complete medication reconciliation based on a single discrepancy, a full medication review is a not required.</p>\n<p><strong>C. Patient education</strong> [<strong>5 minutes; 10%]:</strong></p>\n<p>After resolution of the clinical issue, students will then <strong>provide patient counselling </strong>to the 'patient' for the solution that was agreed to with the 'doctor'. During this station the student will need to explain to the patient how to use the medication (as though the patient is about to be discharged) including: dose, frequency, duration, adverse effects and their management, monitoring and follow-up with the GP, and lifestyle issues in patient centred language. This station requires addressing all PCCs issues raised by the patient in <strong>A</strong> by offering some practical and useful advice.</p>\n<p>Although not strictly timed as follows, estimated timings for the station are: <strong>A)</strong> 5 minutes to take a patient and medication history <strong>B)</strong> 5 minutes perusal to reflect on information gained from the pharmacist-patient consult, take notes, and peruse resources; and to<strong> </strong>discuss and resolve the identified issue with the doctor, and<strong> C) </strong>a further 5 minutes to provide patient counselling. Students need to manage the 15-minute block for Station Two to ensure that the required tasks are completed in the allocated time and students are permitted to switch between A, B, and C as deemed appropriate to gather more information, seek clarification or complete counselling. The focus is on communicating and explaining, and you should demonstrate understanding of the medication, medical condition and the context, including the patient’s situation - hence patient centred care (PCC). Resources are allowed for Station Two (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Station Three [Simple diagnosis and provision of OTC medicine] </strong>in a community pharmacy setting <strong>[5 minutes; 5%]:</strong></p>\n<p>A new customer presents to your pharmacy with a concern about a skin problem. You are to complete a consultation including a medication history, make a diagnosis, and provide an OTC product recommendation and patient education (as a new medicine).</p>\n<p>No resources are allowed for Station Three.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: </strong>Students are permitted to have <strong>ONLY</strong> a pen and blank paper and an <em>approved</em> calculator into the exam (these items are provided). Students are <strong>NOT</strong> permitted to bring any other resources into the exam; this includes but is not limited to, notes, phones, textbooks or watches. Students can access key clinical resources for Station Two: the AMH and APF as hardcopy only; TG and MIMS as electronic copies. These resources are provided by the school, student copies are not allowed. Students should ensure they are familiar with these resources prior to the exam. </p>\n<p>This oral exam will be recorded and retained as per university policy. The recording will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed if required for the purposes of moderation of marking; provision of feedback to the student; and/or re-marking following a successful re-mark application.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
