It shouldn't just list and summarise what you've read. Unlike other assignment types, you're often expected to determine the purpose of a literature review yourself.</p>\n<p>Commonly, a literature review is written to help develop and justify a novel research question. But they have many other uses. For example, you may use a literature review to develop an argument that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>justifies the significance or interest of a research question</li>\n<li>demonstrates your professional competence in a field of research</li>\n<li>critically reviews theory or methodological approaches</li>\n<li>weighs evidence to reach a conclusion or recommendation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>UQ Literature Review Guide: </strong>https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/study-skills/assignment-writing/how-write-literature-review</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Literature Search UQ Library:</strong> https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/library-search</p>\n<p><strong>Word count: </strong>4000 words (excluding references).</p>\n<p><strong>Referencing guide:</strong> https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7</p>\n<p>The Assessment Criteria describes how the Assignment will be assessed (<em>please refer to AGRC7200 blackboard for criteria</em>).</p>\n<p>Given the flexibility around how the reports are structured in this course, supervisors should modify the Table of Contents according to the discipline academic writing standards.
