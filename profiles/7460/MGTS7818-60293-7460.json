At this time, you will gain sign off by your client on the scope of your project based on the information delivered in your consulting proposal.</p>\n<p>Your consulting proposal should reflect a clear understanding of the engagement, context, methodology and timeframes your team will use to deliver a strategic and actionable recommendation and plan. The objectives and activities your outline within your consulting proposal will vary depending on the client situation.</p>\n<p>The consulting proposal should be scoped so that it provides substantial value for the client but also represents a realistic body of work that can be completed by the team effectively during the course of the semester.</p>\n<p>Further consulting proposal guidelines will be disseminated via the Practera platform.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The presentation will be supplemented with a client meeting to facilitate Q&amp;A. The presentation should use an appropriate storyboard logic structure, graphics/illustrations and appropriate text. Slides should not be text-intensive, but rather an appropriate amount of text to substantiate the key points being made in the storyboard. It is not a Word document transplanted into a PowerPoint and should include significant graphics and pictorial content to make the document reader-friendly for most audiences.</p>\n<p>The consultancy presentation and report should contain the following (but not limited to) sections (noting that content will be dependent upon the client needs):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview of client problem</li>\n<li>Viable strategic options</li>\n<li>Description of methodology</li>\n<li>Recommended implementation steps, schedule and financial implications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, your report should contain any supporting evidence collected and driven by the work executed. This should include any and all primary and/or secondary data results and reports used by the team to substantiate recommendations and client outcomes. All spreadsheets including financial projections of revenue, operating and implementation costs should also be included. All sources should be appropriately cited.</p>\n<p>The consultancy presentation and report should clearly communicate your team's recommendations and justifications. Overall teams are being assessed on how well the final presentation and report communicates the extent to which the team has modelled and quantified the measureable impact of their recommendations on the client's business.</p>\n<p>Individual grades will be based on the presentation (40%), final report (35%) and the aggregate results of the second peer evaluation (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Evaluations</strong></p>\n<p>Peer evaluations are designed to provide students with timely and relevant feedback, and to improve your contributions to the team's efforts. There will be two rounds of peer evaluation within the course. The first evaluation is at the time of your pitch proposal and then one on completion of the final assessment. The evaluations will be used primarily to provide feedback so that individuals can build on strengths and develop their improvement areas in relation to the team dynamics. They will also assist in determining individual grades - further informaiton on this is availble via Practera. In addition, you are encouraged to review and debrief team progress/processes collectively at team meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentor and Client Evaluations</strong></p>\n<p>The variability of the Capstone Consultancy Projects creates a challenging learning environment. In order to optimise the learning experience, students will be given the opportunity to evaluate their mentors and clients anonymously within the course of the projects. These evaluations will be anonymous but will serve as a check point on the progress of the projects and highlight any possible team concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>NB: Students must complete the Peer/Mentor/Client Evaluations and the Collaborate Skills Assessments through out the course in order to obtain a grade for the final assessment item. All feedback and evaluations will be submitted via Practera.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
