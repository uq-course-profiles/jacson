Using conceptual knowledge and practical skills (e.g., surveying, quantitative and qualitative analysis) gained from Weeks 1 through 6,  you will work in groups, collecting primary data on Week 7 and analysing them in combination with secondary data in Weeks 8 through 12. Using in-depth analysis and data visualisation,  the end product should describe human spatial behaviour (e.g., tourist mobility, journey-to-work) and create insights to guide planning and public policy.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The project is composed of three stages:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Survey tool design (10% weighting)</p>\n<p>Stage 1 (10%) will present and justify the design of your survey tools produced during the pre-trip workshops. Students will work in a team for in-class discussions and survey design activities. Higher marks will be awarded to students who are able to relate and justify their designs to theories of human spatial behaviour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Fieldwork (10% weighting)</p>\n<p>Stage 2 (10%) consists of the field trip (Week 7) and post-trip data analysis (Weeks 8 and 9). Students will work in their team using the field trip to accomplish four survey activities over a weekend. Students will continue working in their team during post-trip data analysis lectures and practical sessions. A peer evaluation of team member participation will be given at the end of Week 9. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Report writing (30% weighting)</p>\n<p>Stage 3 will present the results of your analysis of your fieldwork in the final individually written report (due in Week 13). Field work data will be combined with secondary data sources, such as the National Visitors Survey and Census data. Higher marks will be awarded for graphical competency (i.e. high quality charts and mapping), where graphical evidence is used to support interpretation and where students are able to relate their findings to theories of human spatial behaviour, as well as planning/policymaking efforts in the local and regional levels.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In line with the course goals, its role will be to assess your knowledge of the content in GEOG2001 and to tap certain of your process capacities in analysing and integrating materials. The final exam is composed of two parts: Part 1 consists of 20 multiple-choice questions, each worth 2 percent. Part 2 consists of six short-answer questions: Students will choose four out of the six questions to answer. Each question is worth 15 percent. In the short-answer questions,students are asked to showcase a reasonable number of analytical skills (quantitative and/or qualitative) beyond an ability to write clear and concise answers with acceptable grammar. Affective elements will be addressed and judged in terms of your capacity to sustain arguments and viewpoints by the processes of conceptualisation and logical justifcation. In total, the final exam is worth 100 percent on paper, and 30 percent of the weighted final mark for the course.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>More details about the final exam will be available on Blackboard as the end of the semester approaches.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>To pass this course, you need to achieve the minimum of 45 percent in the final exam.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
