The mark will be based on the quality of your participation (not just the attendance). You are required to actively engage with tutorial topics by contributing to discussions and engaging with other students respectfully.</p>\n<p> If you cannot attend a tutorial due to extraordinary circumstances, you will have the opportunity to make up for your lost mark with a review of two essential readings for that week, submitted to your tutor by Monday in the following week. The review should not exceed 350 words. You must obtain permission for this from your tutor, and it must be due to unforeseen events (not ongoing work or study commitments, for example).</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> A total of f<strong>our (4) mark </strong>is<strong> </strong>allocated to two reflective notes (250-300 words) on how the readings and tutorial activities illuminated or illustrated one of the core themes in the course. Each submission is worth 2 marks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first reflective note must consider readings and tutorials from week 1 to 6 week, due on <strong>Friday, 30 August at 4:00 pm</strong>.</li>\n<li>The second reflective note must consider readings and tutorials from week 7 to week 12, due on <strong>Friday, 18 October at 4:00 pm</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example will be available on the Blackboard site. This assignment must be submitted via Turnitin.
