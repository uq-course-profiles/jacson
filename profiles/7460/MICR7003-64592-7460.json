This could include genomic sequencing, traceability systems, or other innovative tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Communication</strong>: Press release or mock press conference recording. This should be presented in clear and simple language that is understandable to the general public. </p>\n<p><strong>You will prepare a 10-minute oral presentation using Powerpoint and record the presentation using Zoom or other software which can generate a file that can be easily accessed using standard media players. </strong>Tutorial time slots have been allocated for work to occur and assemble your presentation, however extra work will likely be required outside of these set times in order to complete the task. The Zoom file needs to be submitted before the due date/time through an Assignment submission link in Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra information: </strong></p>\n<p>You need to make sense of the material and present it in a clear understandable manner. The number of slides should be around 10-12 and it should go for at least 9 minutes and no longer than 11 minutes. You should practice your timing before recording it, and you also may need to attempt several recordings to improve it.
