Students may decide to formulate a broad research question and then have a series of sub questions that they answer. The process of developing your research question will be completed in consultation with the lecturer/course coordinator. The lecturer/course coordinator MUST approve your research question. <strong>Students must receive written approval via email from the lecturer/course coordinator. </strong></p>\n<p>The research report must be around 2200 words in length (minus the reference list). Your paper must include proper citation and reference of sources. You must follow the APA 6th style of referencing.</p>\n<p>Your research paper must be double-spaced and typed (in 12 point font), with each page numbered. Please ensure that you have proofread your paper and that your name is on the first page.</p>\n<p>This assessment is designed to assess both your substantive knowledge of content presented in the course and of relevant academic literature and your ability to present a cogent argument. The research report should be written in formal academic style and in correct, grammatical and succinct English. The report should be structured with an introduction that clearly sets out the topic and previews its arguments, a body, and a conclusion that integrates the arguments made, relates them back to your research question and provides recommendations relating to improving police policy and practice. </p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
