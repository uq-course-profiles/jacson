The proposal should contain a brief introduction to area of research and clearly outline the aims of the project followed by the methods you plan to use to achieve these aims. The study plan should outline what is going to occur and when this is planned to occur, with reference to any requirements for the project. </p>\n<p>The following information should be included:</p>\n<p>•\tProject details – Provide details of the project title, supervisory team and your student details (name, student number). This information may be placed on a cover page and is not included in the page limit.</p>\n<p>•\tResearch purpose and aims – Outline the purpose of the research, citing any key literature leading to the question, and outline the aims of the research (and hypotheses where applicable) (suggested length - 1 page).</p>\n<p>•\tResearch methods – Describe how the research will be performed (e.g. outline of structure for literature review; research design or research framework; recruitment methods; outcome measures; measurement methods; statistical design; meta-analysis methods etc) (suggested length - 1 page). If the data being used has previously been collected (secondary data), this should only be briefly described with the majority of the methods detailing what the student will do.</p>\n<p>•\tStudy plan and timeline – Detail a proposed timeline for the research including any requirements for the research, e.g. meetings with supervisors, ethics applications, data collection and analyses, draft submissions, equipment requirements (suggest length - 1 page maximum – table format accepted). Note: the study plan and timeline may include a description of what has been done by the student before the submission of the proposal and study plan.</p>\n<p>•\tReferences - Consistent referencing system with full references to scientific literature to support proposal (suggest between 4-10 references but more are possible).</p>\n<p><strong>Part B </strong>- Professional Standards Mapping: Outline how you will demonstrate three or more professional standard elements by undertaking this research project (suggested length 1 page in table format). Address standards relevant to your chosen professional pathway (AES, AEP and ASpS). Examples of completed standard mapping and the Professional Standards documents can be found under this assessment task on Blackboard. Links to professional standards are as follows:</p>\n<p>Bachelor of Clinical Exercise Physiology (Honours): <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/luf60wq5uppz734/AEP%20standards%20for%20Honours.docx?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/luf60wq5uppz734/AEP%20standards%20for%20Honours.docx?dl=0</a></p>\n<p>Bachelor of Exercise and Sport Sciences (Honours) – wish to be an AES: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/yoynz8vbm9jie2i/AES%20Standards%20for%20Honours.docx?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/yoynz8vbm9jie2i/AES%20Standards%20for%20Honours.docx?dl=0</a></p>\n<p>Bachelor of Exercise and Sport Sciences (Honours) - wish to be an ASpS: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/v6zyoozyoqq50va/ASpS%20standards%20for%20Honours.docx?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/v6zyoozyoqq50va/ASpS%20standards%20for%20Honours.docx?dl=<strong>0</strong></a></p>\n<p>Part B of the assessment is a course hurdle.

Note that this is only a guide and that your supervisor may specify a format (e.g. journal article for a particular journal or traditional research report) and you should discuss the expectations with your supervisor during drafting of your report. The referencing style used can be decided by the student in discussion with the supervisor as long as the same style is used throughout the report. Font style and line spacing is also at the discretion of the student and may need to follow a particular journal style if the report is in the form of a draft manuscript. Content of the report must include sections on Background/Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion to allow the student to achieve the assessment criteria but may also include other elements such as an abstract or supplemental content. You may submit a single draft to your supervisor for feedback prior to submission, however, this should be feedback only and should not involve re-writing of your report.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Practical Component:</p>\n<p>Log: You will be required to undertake a practical component for this course – e.g. data collection, data analysis or literature collation and analysis. The student is required to keep a log of the practical and other research tasks undertaken during this time. A sample log can be found on Blackboard under the Assessment tab.</p>\n<p>Reflection: A reflection on the experience is included in the practical component so that the supervisor can assess the research practice criteria. Suggested content:</p>\n<p>•\tIdentify any issues you encountered with completing your research project and how these were dealt with.</p>\n<p>•\tIn retrospect, suggest how you would overcome some of the limitations or problems encountered during your research practice.</p>\n<p>•\tReflect on how you addressed the professional standards you identified in your professional standards mapping hurdle task.</p>\n<p>•\tReflect on the research experience and comment on your experience, e.g. what you enjoyed or found most challenging, what were the main things you learnt about conducting research.</p>\n<p><strong>Both the log and refection should be included at the end of the report.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
