The presentation will provide an overview of the crisis, a description of the organisation, a crisis timeline, actions, and responses taken, media analysis, stakeholder impacts, lessons learned, and recommendations. Students should use a mix of scholarly references, media coverage, and organisational materials. This will occur in <strong>week 9</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the second part, students will submit an essay incorporating the feedback from their fellow students and tutors. The essay should address the criteria as outlined in the assessment task and rubric.
