These observations are to be set in context against a discussion of the prevailing synoptic scale circulation patterns. This is extremely important as no atmospheric phenomenon is discrete, but instead is part of a continuum, i.e. the development of a sea breeze along the coastline of southeast Queensland is dependent on clear skies and weak synoptic pressure gradients, which are typically associated with the presence of an anticyclone. However, these conditions may also result in poor ventilation of the boundary layer leading to poor air quality in urban areas. Therefore, you should demonstrate in your report an understanding of the linkages between atmospheric processes at a range of space-time scales, and how these influence local air quality. Highlight any notable meteorological events which result in severe or unusual weather such as storms, flooding or damaging winds, or unusually high levels of air pollution. Be original and creative in the presentation of supporting data. Remember that large and/or excessive use of tables to present data is not an effective format to relay information to the reader. In some cases this may detract from the readability of your essay and result in a lower than expected grade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Sources of Information:</strong></p>\n<p>The principal sources of data for your study will come from the World-Wide-Web. Local meteorological conditions are monitored on campus by our automatic weather station located on the Social Sciences building. This data can be accessed via the Web at https://sees.uq.edu.au/community/weather-station. This site also has a live web cam for cloud observations. Air quality data can be found at: https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/air-quality/ This site also provides background material on air quality as well as access to historical data.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Bureau of Meteorology (http://www.bom.gov.au/) has an excellent site providing links to current satellite and weather radar images, synoptic analyses (weather maps) and current observations from other weather stations in the Brisbane area. However, much of this information is<strong> NOT</strong> archived and you should therefore arrange to access such data on a daily basis – perhaps rostered with a group of friends. You should also keep a weather log of your own observations, i.e. cloud cover, type and height, wind direction, rainfall etc. Do <strong>NOT</strong> ring or visit government offices or agencies (Federal, State or Local) in order to undertake this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong></p>\n<p>A maximum word limit of 2600 words is set for this assignment (plus or minus 10%; penalties apply to under length or over length essays).
