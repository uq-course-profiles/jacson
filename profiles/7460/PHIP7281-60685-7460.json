Seminars may also be held via Zoom.</p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome to attend any or all of the seminars, and the School research community (that includes you) are encouraged to attend. Presenters may be anyone from a Professor to a PhD student, with a range of presentation experiences. If you are doing your research experience in a laboratory outside of PACE, you are welcome to attend the seminars of that organisational unit and report on those seminars.</p>\n<p>Attending research seminars is not only an opportunity to find out what is currently happening in research, and appreciate the scope of research in pharmacy, but also to consider what you like or don’t like about how different researchers choose to orally/verbally present their work to their peers – i.e. their presentation style. For example, did you understand the material (i.e. could you very briefly sum it up in your own words)? Did the presenter refer to their slides? Did they engage and interact with you (the audience), e.g. did they maintain eye contact, or attempt interaction with you where appropriate? How did they try to maintain your interest throughout the presentation? </p>\n<p>Ultimately, reflecting on presentations by others can help you to consider how to improve your own oral presentations so that your audience finds it engaging and memorable.</p>\n<p>In this course, you will reflect on your experience of any TWO of the seminars presented during the semester. The 4 Rs of Reflection will be the approach used in this course. This approach was originally introduced in 2002 by Bain et al. as the 5 Rs for reflections on teaching and has been modified to fit this course (Bain JD, Ballantyne R, Mills C. and Lester NC. (2002). Reflecting on practice: Student teachers' perspectives. Post Pressed, Flaxton, Qld.). See the course blackboard site for the 4 Rs of reflection. </p>\n<p>How to complete this assessment:</p>\n<p>For TWO of the research seminars that you attend during the semester:</p>\n<p>1. Use the PHIP7280/PHIP7281 oral presentation rubric as a guide to assess the seminar presenter</p>\n<p>2. Based on this, reflect on your experience of the presentation using the 4 Rs of reflection:</p>\n<p>Reporting</p>\n<p>Responding</p>\n<p>Relating</p>\n<p>Reconstructing</p>\n<p>Use the prompts in the table on the blackboard site to help you interpret the 4 Rs. </p>\n<p>Your response for EACH seminar reflection should be written in 4 paragraphs. Paragraph 1 is \"reporting\", paragraph 2 \"responding\", paragraph 3 \"relating\" and paragraph 4 \"reconstructing\".</p>\n<p>The word limit for EACH reflection is 500 words. Only the first 500 words for each reflection will be marked.</p>\n<p>The seminar reflection marking criteria will be used to mark each reflection that you provide according to the 4 Rs. The average mark from the reflections will be used towards your final grade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
