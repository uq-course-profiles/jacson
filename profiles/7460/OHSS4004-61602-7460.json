It may address a whole of organisation issue or be targeted at a particular sub-group or hazard. Your initiative can cost up to $200 000 and should be able to be implemented within a 12-month timeframe. There are a range of UQ documents on Blackboard that may assist you to identify your issue.</p>\n<p>There are four components to this assessment reflect a real-world approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development and presentation of a “<strong>pitch</strong>” on your proposed OHS initiative – this is a quick 3 minute presentation to gauge interest and feedback on your proposed “problem”</li>\n<li>Preparation of a <strong>business case</strong> for your OHS initiative – this would typically be a written proposal to senior management clearly identifying a need, demonstrating the options on offer and proposing the best solution, it will be supported by a cost-benefit analysis – this is a “marketing” focused document aimed to convince management to spend the $200 000;</li>\n<li>Development of a <strong>project plan</strong> for your OHS initiative – once senior management have “signed off” on the concept it is time to develop and document all the details of the initiative, including the evaluation component. This document should be able to stand alone and allow a third party to undertake the initiative as required.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation</strong> of your OHS initiative to senior management – once your project has been fully planned it is normal to present the total package to senior management, the presentation should include key elements from both the business case and the project plan, it is at this point that the funds will get full approval.</li>\n</ol>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
