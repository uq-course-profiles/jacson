Three of the practicals have Lab Report Reflections or Presentations worth 5% of the total grade (totalling 15%). Missing a practical/laboratory (without a valid reason) will result in a Lab Report mark of zero for that practical. Failure to attend two or more laboratory sessions, without an approved absence, will result in a grade of no better than a pass (4).. Students will be required to demonstrate practical skills in Neuromechanical techniques and interpretation of data as well as being able and interpret results from research literature using similar methods. </p>\n<p>During the practical you will be required to collect some data that is relevant to the specific learning module. Some basic instructions for analysis will be provided. This data will then be scrutinised with respect to a specific practical or research question that is assigned to you in the practical. You will be required to generate appropriate graphs or tables so that you can present this data to the class. You will also need to examine the research literature and relate your results to what you find is already known. This will involve some critical analysis of research literature to demonstrate that you understand the methods used in the practical and how your research goal / question might be relevant in the general field of exercise or sports science. </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
