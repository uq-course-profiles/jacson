To encourage this engagement, 30% of your grade will be based on course engagement. This consists of<strong> two </strong>components:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Seminar participation (14%) - weeks 2-10 &amp; 12</strong></p>\n<p>Seminar participation is worth 14 of the available 30 course engagement marks. Participation is not just about making smart comments or getting answers to questions right; it is also about airing ideas, asking questions, and contributing to a productive classroom discussion. Mike will keep a record of who participates in seminar discussions. Participation in each seminar is worth up to 2 marks in weeks 2-10 &amp; 12. Your <strong>best seven</strong> seminars will be used towards your participation mark.</p>\n<p>If you cannot attend the seminar due to a valid reason (i.e. exceptional circumstances / illness supported by relevant documentation), please contact me <strong>prior </strong>to the seminar by email and you may be allowed to complete substitute work in lieu of seminar participation. If your request is approved, you will submit an agreed-upon piece of assessment <strong>before</strong> the next seminar.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Reading responses (16%) - weeks 2-10 &amp; 12</strong></p>\n<p>Reading responses are worth 16 of the available 30 course engagement marks. You must complete <strong><em>eight</em></strong> short reading responses (400-500 words). Each reading response is worth up to 2 marks. Your reading response should briefly summarize the key ideas in the week’s readings and provide a short, focused critique. You must submit each reading response via Blackboard and using Turnitin<em> </em>by <strong>Monday</strong> <strong>1pm</strong> for the relevant week. Responses submitted after Monday 2pm will not be accepted. However, if you are unable to submit a reading response by the due date due to exceptional circumstances / illness (relevant supporting documentation is required), please contact me <strong>before</strong> 1pm on the day of the seminar.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT). Failure to comply with this direction may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

After demonstrating why the outcome/event is important, the main element of your proposal will be a literature review. You should present your literature review and critically analyze each article/book, explaining how it helps us understand your chosen outcome/event. Importantly, you also need to identify a “gap” in the literature and identify propose a type of study that could be undertaken that could fill that gap.</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2.</strong> If you choose to lead a seminar, you are expected to lead the class that day. Up to 2 people can lead a seminar. You should be prepared to lead the discussion and be the “expert” for the day. In principle there are several ways in which you can lead a discussion. A simple format would be to set the stage for the seminar by speaking about the week’s topic and readings for a few minutes before turning to the class with some discussion questions. I also suggest having a list of questions on standby to get the conversation back on track if necessary.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to attend your chosen seminar due to exceptional circumstances / illness (relevant supporting documentation is required), please contact me<strong> before </strong>1pm on the day of the seminar and we will work something out. For example, I may allow you to complete a research proposal instead.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
