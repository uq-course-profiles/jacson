This includes the use of a lab or field notebook, which is an important document to record experimental design and data in a manner that can be easily understood by another person from this area of research. In some cases data may be monitored and stored on electronic devices. It is appropriate for supervisors to modify the criteria depending on the type of project. Please inquire whether your supervisor wishes to modify the criteria.  The lab / field / modelling and other logbook, notebooks or agreed electronic records must be submitted to your supervisor on the due date.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

As a guide, it is expected that students will undertake ~100 hours of laboratory/field and library work. This may be undertaken at any time in the semester that is mutually suitable to the student and supervisors.</p>\n<p>Report: You will write a detailed report in the same style as a scientific paper (~3500 words in total but not over 4000 words, excluding title, author name, acknowledgements, references, figures, tables and their legends; However, in-text citations are included in the word count). the paper will be is formatted in the style consistent with the requirements of a selected peer reviewed journal, as decided with the student supervisory team. Please add the word count on the first page of your report and the journal the paper is formatted for. You can use the journal's instructions to authors (but do not pass the word count of 4000 words). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You should discuss with your supervisor which journal would be an appropriate outlet in which to publish the type of research that you have done, and identify the journal in your written report. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Your report will be marked by two academics but not by your supervisor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Acknowledging the contribution of others: if you have done your project with help from other members of the laboratory you are working in, this should be acknowledged on your first page. Collaborations with others is expected in science, but it must be clear to your markers what is your own work. Contributions include: substantial help with acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, or drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content. If you have been provided with a dataset to analyse, also make this clear in your report (it is sometimes unclear whether the student was given the data or collected it themselves). </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
