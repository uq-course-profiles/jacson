The review should lead to a statement of the aim of the hypothetical research project and its relevant research question(s), which should be logically extracted from the preceding review and application of established theories/guidelines related to the research topic. The review should clearly demonstrate the justification and importance of the proposed research along with its potential benefits in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>The assignment should contain <strong>a maximum of six (6) pages</strong> excluding title page and references. The assignment should be typed in 12-point Times New Roman font with double spacing and 2.50cm margins.
