Nor, indeed, are you confined to war. You may wish to write, for example, about interwar pacifists, about grief and loss on the home front, or the perceived threat of nuclear armageddon post-World War II, or the anti-nuclear movement, for just some examples. <strong>The essay MUST, however, have the idea of \"Total War\" as a central theme. </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Remember that war is part of the broader culture and society, and a good essay will explore the way war has been influenced by, or has influenced and intersected with, other aspects of society. When choosing a topic, ensure that you do not choose something that is too “war bound.” You should be looking for the intersections between total war, society and culture. This need not restrict the topic area you choose, but you should be looking to take a sophisticated approach to the topic area. For example, an essay on the technical developments necessary for the manufacture of an atomic bomb in 1944-45 would not be acceptable, but an essay on how some post-WWII governments sought to satisfy these requirements by funding science and building national industrial infrastructure would. Similarly, an essay on the experience of grief and the public commemoration of loss would be acceptable, but an essay on the battle tactics of trench warfare would not.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Essay proposals are designed to allow the marker to assess student progress well before receiving the final version of the major component of the semester’s work. Essentially, evaluating and discussing a detailed proposal with you will enable us to assist you in producing a better major essay.</p>\n<p>A good essay proposal will introduce the historical issue, will outline the questions to be addressed, and will suggest some tentative arguments.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The topic should always be framed as a question so that your essay takes the shape of an answer to a particular historical problem or issue.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The use of ChatGP and other AI in the writing of your essay proposal is not permitted, and if detected will be reported to the Student Integrity Officer.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

What elements of the poem could have been perceived as unacceptable by the public - or part of the public - when it was posthumously published in 1921? What could have been perceived as inappropriate in Remarque’s chapters at the time of the publication in 1929, and why? Do you think that these two chapters can be considered as an expression - or a manifesto - of Pacifism? Why is the fact that the book was published in 1929 is significant? What, according to Eksteins, was the real purpose of the book? How can we explain the tremendous success of the book? Essential Readings Owen, Wilfred.

The most obvious and famous examples of technological breakthroughs during WWII are the atomic bomb and German missile technology. Neither, however, made a difference to the war’s outcome.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial we consider some less well-known feats of technology which arguably did make a substantial difference. Winston Churchill, in his chapter, underlines the importance of technology in the air battle that raged in 1940-1941 over Britain, demonstrating that the bravery and skill of the RAF pilots were not the only reason for the successes against the Luftwaffe. R.V. Jones, a scientist, explains how the British discovered and tried to counter the V2 program, while Paul Kennedy looks at the role of technology in allowing the alkies to triumph in the longest-running battle of WWII – the Battle of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>Find in Churchill’s text the elements that reveal him writing as a politician as much as an 'historian.' What, according to Churchill, made the difference between the British and the Germans in the air warfare over Britain?</p>\n<p>How did the British manage the threat represented by the V2 when they discovered its existence? Was the British response rational enough?

            "topic_description": "Week 8 Tutorial: The Wizard War The technological advances of wartime are often staggering, and the side that most effectively combines technology and industry often reaps considerable benefits. The most obvious and famous examples of technological breakthroughs during WWII are the atomic bomb and German missile technology. Neither, however, made a difference to the war’s outcome. In this tutorial we consider some less well-known feats of technology which arguably did make a substantial difference. Winston Churchill, in his chapter, underlines the importance of technology in the air battle that raged in 1940-1941 over Britain, demonstrating that the bravery and skill of the RAF pilots were not the only reason for the successes against the Luftwaffe. R.V. Jones, a scientist, explains how the British discovered and tried to counter the V2 program, while Paul Kennedy looks at the role of technology in allowing the alkies to triumph in the longest-running battle of WWII – the Battle of the Atlantic. Find in Churchill’s text the elements that reveal him writing as a politician as much as an 'historian.' What, according to Churchill, made the difference between the British and the Germans in the air warfare over Britain? How did the British manage the threat represented by the V2 when they discovered its existence? Was the British response rational enough? In general, what do you think of the tone of the chapter and of the attitude of Dr. Jones? What main factors turned the Battle of the Atlantic? Taken as a whole, what do these examples suggest about the importance of science and technology to the outcome of WWII, and the relative effectiveness of Allied vs Axis deployment of new technologies?
