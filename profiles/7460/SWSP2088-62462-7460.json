Each group will be allocated a topic which will be available on Blackboard in Week 2. The community work practice skills workshops are crucial to your development as a future social worker. You will have the opportunity to practice essential group work and community practice skills. Should a student be unable to attend and participate in a Week 4-7 tutorial due to ill health or unanticipated personal crisis when other groups are presenting then a catch-up group work activity (such as facilitating an activity in one of the group tutorials) will be required to ensure that the student has met the course learning outcomes as stipulated by Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) accreditation course requirements.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><em>Part 2: Individual Reflection</em></p>\n<p>Weighting: 25%</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description:</strong> Students will undertake a reflective analysis designed to deepen their understanding of community work practice. They will be required to write an (individual) reflection that addresses what has been learned, including skills, the links to theory and implications for their future practice. For this task,  they will critically reflect on the use of a problem-posing approach drawing on their experience as a facilitator of a community work skills workshop on their topic <strong><em>and</em></strong><em> </em>as a participating member in <strong><em>at least one</em></strong> of the community work skills workshops facilitated by another student group. The reflective analysis will be supported with examples drawing on <em>each</em><strong><em> </em></strong>of these experiences.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. While students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
