This assessment piece is designed to support student's transition from theory to practice by promoting critical self-reflection. Students are required to analytically reflect upon a real-life ‘critical’ event, incident, activity or task that you experience on placement. A critical incident can be positive or negative. These are events or ‘light bulb moments’ which occurred during (or as a result of) your clinical development and have impacted you in an important (critical) way. A total of two written reflections need to be submitted throughout HMST3001 (upon the accrual of 60 and 100 placement hours, respectively). They should provide insight into how your professional skills and attributes improve, the challenges you overcome and identify, and the new training methods you’ve added to your professional ‘toolbox’. Content should follow the SEALER reflection structure. </p>\n<p><strong>A note on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Critical Reflections evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</li>\n<li>The Professional Attributes Intermediate Assessment is to be completed in-person.
