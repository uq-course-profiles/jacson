Your reflection can be based on any clinical experience that you have observed that demonstrated good professional practice or has resulted in your perspective or informed your future practice. You will need to describe the experience, analyse the experience and reflect on how it has informed your future practice.</p>\n<p>The reflective process has the potential to enable the beginning health practitioner to learn from their professional experiences, to link theory and practice gaps, and to describe and understand their own feelings and influence, in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>Through reflection on your clinical exposure, the purposes of this assessment task are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>recognise the focus on the patient’s best interests and providing patient-centred care and respect patients’ dignity;</li>\n<li>observe and describe communication and engagement with patients, patient’s families and communities in relation to oral health;</li>\n<li>observe and understand the importance of communication and intra and inter-professional approaches to health care.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FORMAT:</p>\n<p> The final submission is to be a video journal of your reflections. The length of the video should be between 3 to 5 minutes and it should demonstrate the ability to reflect on your observations.</p>\n<p>The expectations of the type of video are very broad and while you are encouraged to be creative with the presentation of your reflection, there are no marks awarded for presentation.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
