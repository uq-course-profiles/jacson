That is, you will specifically address the implications for the design of an exercise program that rehabilitates the patient towards performance of their task at a level that they can participate in training and competition.</p>\n<p>The presentation will be fifteen (15) minutes in length followed by five (5) minutes of questions and discussion. </p>\n<p>The sport and task analysis chosen must be different to those included in the lecture/PBL series. </p>\n<p>Presentations will be held on the 24th of September.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Written report (15%)</strong></p>\n<p>Students will design a progressive exercise program that is specific to the sport and injury selected in Part 1. Students will submit a written report that contains the specific exercise program designed for a patient. This will include an overall plan, full details of exercises and progression, and criteria for progression through the duration of the exercise program from after the acute phase to return to sport/activity. </p>\n<p>Written report is due Monday 4th November (2:00pm AEST).</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
