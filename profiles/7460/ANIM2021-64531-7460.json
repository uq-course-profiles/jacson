This practical consists of 2 parts; the first using data collected in the first week of semester (July), and the second using data collected towards the end of semester (October). A group of focal cows will be identified to undertake the observational component of this practical. During the observations data collected will include: respiration rate, panting score and body surface temperature (BST) measurements. From the data obtained during the practical you will be required to generate a 3-minute (3MT) presentation. For your 3MT style presentation you will use the information you generated during the practical to prepare a conference style e-poster that you will present as a 3-minute presentation. You get one slide to do as you wish. There are no set guidelines for what your slide needs to contain, so you have a lot of flexibility and free choice here.

These exchanges involve heat production and dissipation, and are dependent on both biological and physical factors. In animal production systems providing animals with shade has been a primary strategy for reducing the impact of hot climatic conditions. Here we will use goats as a case study to investigate the benefits of providing animals with shade. The objective of this practical is to investigate how manmade shade structures influence the microclimate animals inhabit and the impact that this has on physiological response in goats. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In this practical you will be undertaking behavioural and physiological observations on goats that have been assigned (randomly) to either a shaded area or unshaded area. These animals will be given time to habituate to the treatments while data loggers to monitor climatic conditions are deployed. Upon commencement of the data collection period you will be undertaking behavioural and physiological observations on the goats. During the observations data collected will include: respiration rate, panting score and body surface temperature (BST) measurements in conjunction with microclimate conditions. From the data obtained during the practical you will be required to generate a poster depicting your results. Your poster will need to contain an introduction, results, discussion and conclusions. There are no set guidelines for what your poster needs to look like, so you have a lot of flexibility and free choice here.  </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A more detailed Practical Description, Poster Presentation Description and Poster Rubric will be provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p><strong>Background. </strong>Climate change is likely to have negative impacts on the reproductive performance of domestic and wild species. Heat stress can have large effects on most aspects of reproductive function in mammals. These include disruptions in spermatogenesis and oocyte development, oocyte maturation, early embryonic development, foetal and placental growth and lactation. These deleterious effects of heat stress are the result of either the hyperthermia associated with heat stress or the physiological adjustments made by the heat-stressed animal to regulate body temperature. There are both direct and indirect effects of heat on reproductive performance. A direct effect is the increase in the temperature of the scrotum due to high ambient temperature, an indirect effect is reduced feed intake leading to weight loss, and subsequent reduction in fertility of females. There is also evidence showing heat stressed females produce lighter weight young which subsequently impacts on the young’s future reproductive performance. For this literature review you are to discuss the effects of heat stress on reproductive performance in mammals, with a focus on a species of choice (companion, livestock or wildlife). </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Literature Review Structure. </strong></p>\n<p>You may find it useful to use these descriptions to create headings to start your literature review skeleton.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Introduction - define/describe the problem, that is highlighting the animal of choice in context of the climatic conditions you are discussing, i.e. heat stress in giraffes.</li>\n<li>Main Content - discussing the implications for reproduction.</li>\n<li>Future Challenges - you may wish to consider the impact of climate change on the species of choice.</li>\n<li>Conclusions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credibility &amp; References. </strong></p>\n<p>Given that this is a literature review you will need to do lots of reading, so you are encouraged to choose a topic that is of interest to you. Selecting a topic that is of interest to you will make this task more enjoyable to complete, otherwise you will find it a dreadful task that you will take nothing away from. In addition, it is advisable that you select a topic that you are able to find scientific resources easily </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>General Formatting and Communication.</strong></p>\n<p>The main body of the literature review should be 2500-3000 words, this includes your in-text citations, BUT excludes the reference list provided at the end. For this literature I am requesting the use of Journal of Animal Science formatting. The reason is simple, in my opinion this is the most simplistic and discipline relevant citation style that exists for us. The general rules are simple. Your literature must be typed, 1.5 to 2.0 line spacings are ok, font size 12, in Australian (British) English and neatly presented. Communicating your thoughts in a concise and grammatically correct manner is essential to any written document, here at The University of Queensland or outside this institution. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A more detailed Description and Rubric will be provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
