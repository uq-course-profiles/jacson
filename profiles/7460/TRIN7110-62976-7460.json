Check the Language and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA) and Modern Language Association (MLA) databases for articles to find research articles.</p>\n<p>For each article, answer the following questions in a separate entry:</p>\n<p><strong>1. What research question(s) did the article attempt to answer?</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the research question(s) and, where relevant, any hypotheses tested. Please DO NOT COPY the questions directly from the paper, but paraphrase and summarise them in your own words.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What was the motivation for the study?</strong></p>\n<p>Describe the motivation for the research undertaken. If possible, specify if (and how) it was a replication and refinement of earlier research, an extension of prior research to fill an existing gap in the literature, or an attempt to break new ground. Be specific. Name and cite previous studies, where appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong>.<strong> What methodology was used?</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the research methodology used to address the research question(s) by noting such questions as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who were the participants?;</li>\n<li>What materials were used?;</li>\n<li>What tools/techniques/procedures were used?; and</li>\n<li>How was the data collected and analysed?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. What were the findings?</strong></p>\n<p>Briefly state the results of the study. Were the research question(s) addressed? Were the hypotheses (if applicable) proved or disproved?</p>\n<p><strong>5. What were the implications of the study?</strong></p>\n<p>Evaluate the study’s value (contribution to the field) and shortcomings, and suggest improvements to mitigate these limitations.</p>\n<p>Each entry should be no longer than <strong>300 words</strong>. Your answers should be presented as a coherent and logical summary of the article rather than a list of answers to the five questions above. Bibliographic details for each article should be presented at the beginning of each entry in accordance with the APA referencing style. Any citations mentioned in the text should be followed by a reference list (which will not contribute to the overall word count), also formatted according to APA. After completing the 3 entries, write a short (up to 400 words) comparison of your findings for the 3 articles analysed. Comment on differences and similarities across the 3 articles and why you think these differences and similarities exist. These common features might include the kind of research questions asked, the motivations, and the aim of the study.</p>\n<p>Some style notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type on A4-size paper (double spacing).</li>\n<li>Use 12-point Calibri font.</li>\n<li>Number your entries.</li>\n<li>The article should be cited at the beginning of each entry using the APA referencing style.</li>\n<li>Follow APA for formatting your document.</li>\n<li>Always aim to paraphrase and use your own words; your writing should demonstrate critical analysis and synthesis of information.</li>\n<li>Write the number of words at the end of your assignment. The total word length should not exceed 1300 words.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Statement on Generative AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students’ abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
