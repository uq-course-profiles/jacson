This includes discussing and implementing the image processing sequence, including: geometric and radiometric corrections, spectral enhancements, spatial enhancements, image classification, and accuracy assessment. Note that some corrections may already be applied. You may choose an aspect of personal interest (land-use, agriculture, vegetation, geomorphology, soils, geology, urban form and condition, or another topic). If you do not have an interest in a particular topic, a land-cover classification project may be suitable.</p>\n<h2><br/></h2>\n<h2>Project Type: Individual Remote Sensing Project</h2>\n<h3>You will work individually to apply an image processing sequence to remote sensing data for an area of your choice. The area extent is suggested to be up to 50km2 (with a large degree of freedom) in order to provide an informed analysis. You will need to select a suitable mapping or modelling application to apply. Please speak with the Course Coordinator for recommendations. </h3>\n<h2><br/></h2>\n<h2>Overview:</h2>\n<p>To ensure your project is feasible you are required to <strong>submit an approx. 8-12 page </strong>proposal containing the following: a statement of the aim(s) of your image processing; a short description of the problem (preferably with relevant references), the used Remote sensing image data sets used, study site map, an outline or flowchart of the image processing operations you intend to apply; information extraction process, accuracy assessment, details of your intended output product(s), and strengths and limitations of the proposed workflow. The remote sensing project proposal should include scientific journal references to support the proposal project.</p>\n<p>Examples of suitable topics are: land-cover classification for a region; quantifying mine rehabilitation, quantifying snow melt characteristics of an alpine region, evaluating seasonal vegetation patterns etc.</p>\n<p>The proposal contributes 22% to the course grade for GEOM3001/7001 and is essential for good preparation of your project and can provide a basis for the final project report.</p>\n<h3>See the supplied Proposal Template and follow this for the submission.</h3>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
