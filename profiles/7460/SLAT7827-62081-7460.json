Students must complete at least 10 out of 12 sets to fulfil assessment criteria for this task. These can be in the form of \"worked examples\" or \"notes\" and students will receive guidance, examples and training in the Week 1 tutorial about how to create these materials and upload them to the RIPPLE platform. Students should write the materials on their own (plagiarism will be referred to the SLC Integrity Officer for investigation), although students can supplement their materials with links to useful videos, journal articles, or other online resources. There is no minimum or maximum word limit on the submissions. The learning materials should be designed so as to be useful for MA-level students in understanding SLAT7827 course content. RIPPLE tracks the number of materials students create.</li>\n<li><strong>RIPPLE Short Evaluations:</strong> Each week (from weeks 2-12), students are expected to evaluate at least 3 sets of learning materials prepared by other classmates on the RIPPLE platform. A minimum of 30 short evaluations are required to fulfill relevant assessment criteria for this task. Training on how to evaluate other's materials will be provided in the Week 1 tutorial. RIPPLE tracks the number of evaluations students complete. Students' evaluations will leave a 'ranking' for the created learning materials, and students can use these materials to help them better understand weekly content</li>\n<li><strong>Video reflection (submitted via Turnitin): </strong>Students must produce a video reflection on the process and the outcomes of creating their learning materials and evaluating the materials of others. <strong>  </strong>Students should: A) Comment on how the creation of their learning materials in general has led them to better understand SLAT7827 course content. B) Comment specifically on ONE of their highest-ranked sets of learning materials and explain why/how these materials were chosen and how they might improve others' knowledge of SLAT7827 course content, AND C) Comment on TWO specific sets of learning materials supplied by others that the student ranked highly or found particularly useful, and how these improved the student's knowledge of SLAT7827 course content. Submission via Turnitin - a link to upload the video will be given in the relevant 'assessment' folder in the course Blackboard site, with instructions also provided by your tutor prior to upload. At the START of the video, you must talk to the camera (ie NOT a photograph) and introduce yourself clearly showing your UQ ID card on FULL SCREEN.
