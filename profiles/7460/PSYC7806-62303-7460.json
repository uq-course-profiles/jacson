You are not required to adhere to the PRISMA guidelines, and you do not need to provide a summary table which describes all of the studies you are discussing in your review.</p>\n<p>Rather, you will engage with a body of literature which is known to provide some support for the effectiveness and/or efficacy of a counselling approach with a specified client population. You will critically review this body of literature for the purpose of evaluating the robustness of the evidence and any limitations and/or considerations practitioners should be aware of in order to utilise the approach effectively. </p>\n<p>This task does not require you to have an advanced understanding of research methodology and design. When evaluating the robustness of the evidence base, you will consider basic methodology factors such as the number of studies that contribute to the evidence base, the number of participants included in those studies, the presence (or not) of control groups, the limitations of the studies (as identified by the studies’ authors), recommendations for appropriate implementation of the approach, as discussed by the studies’ authors. </p>\n<p>To get started, you may like to refer to clinical guidelines, such as:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://psychology.org.au/getmedia/23c6a11b-2600-4e19-9a1d-6ff9c2f26fae/evidence-based-psych-interventions.pdf\">evidence-based-psych-interventions.pdf (psychology.org.au)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/mental-health-behavioural-and-neurodevelopmental-conditions\">Mental health, behavioural and neurodevelopmental conditions | Topic | NICE</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mentalhealth.melbournechildrens.com/media/r30o55uh/cpg-technical-evidence-report_2023.pdf\">cpg-technical-evidence-report_2023.pdf (melbournechildrens.com)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/crpsychosocialinterventions.pdf\">Table of Evidence-Based Child and Adolescent Psychosocial Interventions (aap.org)</a></p>\n<p>These documents may assist you to identify and/or evaluate relevant efficacy/effectiveness studies or to choose your own topic.</p>\n<p>Your critical review will include:</p>\n<p>·      A clear statement of the counselling intervention/approach you are reviewing AND the characteristics of the group of children/young people (e.g., age range; diagnostic status; other relevant details e.g., children in foster care) for whom you are evaluating the appropriateness of this intervention/approach; </p>\n<p>·      A detailed description of the counselling intervention/approach you are critically reviewing;</p>\n<p>·      A detailed description of relevant empirical literature which has evaluated the efficacy or effectiveness of the identified counselling intervention/approach with the identified group;</p>\n<p>·      A critical evaluation of the empirical literature which has evaluated the efficacy or effectiveness of the identified counselling intervention/approach with the identified group (including quality of the studies; noted gaps);</p>\n<p>·      A conclusion with respect to the appropriateness of the use of this counselling intervention/approach with this group of children/young people, including any special considerations and/or constraints that may limit its appropriateness.</p>\n<p>For your critical review, you may choose one of the following topics or you may choose your own topic. </p>\n<p>·      Interpersonal Therapy for young people with depressive symptoms and/or a diagnosis of depression.</p>\n<p>·      Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for young people with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>\n<p>·      Family-based interventions for young people with a diagnosis of an eating disorder.</p>\n<p>·      Trauma-focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (TF-CBT) or Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for young children who have experienced trauma. </p>\n<p>·      Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) for children displaying internalising and/or externalising behaviour problems. </p>\n<p>·      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for young people with anxiety.</p>\n<p>·      Play therapy for young children with a range of presenting issues.</p>\n<p>·      Gestalt therapy for young people with a range of presenting issues.</p>\n<p>·      Narrative therapy for young people with a range of presenting issues. </p>\n<p>·      Internal Family Systems therapy for young people with a range of presenting issues.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>If you are choosing your own topic, please discuss your intended topic with the Course Coordinator by no later than 27 September 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes on use of AI in this assignment</strong></p>\n<p>It is an important academic and professional skill to make informed decisions about the use of interventions in your therapeutic work.
