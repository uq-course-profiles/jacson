The nature of these activities will vary according to the placement, but may include admitting/clerking patients, assessing patients at outpatient clinics, presenting at ward rounds and demonstrating initiative in attending other activities such as grand rounds.</p>\n<p>Scoring in the Clinical Participation Assessment (CPA) is based on conduct and contribution during ward rounds and case discussions, initiative in seeking learning opportunities, patient assessment, ability to succinctly present a patient case including differential diagnosis, behaviour towards peers and medical (and all other) colleagues and awareness of social and ethical issues including risk assessment.</p>\n<p>The CPA has components which assess Clinical Communication, History Taking, Examination Skills, Clinical Reasoning, Professional Practice, Reflective Practice, Social/Cultural Competence and Safety. There is also a Student Flag component which allows a supervisor to report a student with concerning unprofessional or unsafe behaviour. The Student Flag component also provides a mechanism for notifying exemplary performance to the School.</p>\n<p>To maximise your learning students are encouraged to actively seek feedback from their clinical teacher/s during their clinical placement. This will assist in identifying any areas requiring further improvement before your final Clinical Participation Assessment is completed.
