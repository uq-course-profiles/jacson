Independently verifying the comprehension answer to show its correctness; and producing a group response to the interpretive question that summarises the Zoom discussion;</p>\n<p>4. Submitting a link to a Zoom recording of the group meeting where you discuss the final questions/answers and agree that they were feasible and accurate (see 3) and where the group tries to formulate a collective position on the interpretive question.

The student should speak in answer for 5-6 minutes (an alarm will sound at 5.30). Two follow-up questions will then be asked that will be intended to allow the student to amplify/clarify their answer and demonstrate their mastery of the texts for those segments (answers should be approx. 2 minutes each). None of the questions will be intended to trick or intimidate, and your grade <strong>can only improve through the Q&amp;A </strong>(i.e. your speech will set a floor and the final grade will then be higher or the same, not lower). </p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>We will build oral skills and confidence throughout the tutorials, including a chance for an informal practice of the assessment with a peer in seminars towards the end of semester.
