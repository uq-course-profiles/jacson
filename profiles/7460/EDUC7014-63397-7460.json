The main purpose is to establish your understanding of the pedagogical concepts involved, and have the technical skills to construct a course containing a unit overview for 4 lessons using a range of digital tools. You will not be creating any of the actual lessons, just providing a summary of each, using the template provided. The rationale behind the development of the course and the justification for the selection of technologies are most important and the marks awarded will reflect this. Assignment three will require you to design two detailed lessons from this course you create. You are then to write a justification and synthesis in the form of a report to explain your choices in the design and pedagogy of the online learning platform sequence you have constructed. It would be expected you would use the course readings and other peer reviewed literature to justify your approach and choices. Remember to take into account the particular audience you are targeting (e.g. an age group; culturally diverse students; neurodivergent; gifted; special education needs), and appeal to different learning styles. Please remember to ensure that it is reported what age group the lesson is intended for.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
