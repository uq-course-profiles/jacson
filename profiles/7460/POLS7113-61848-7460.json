At the same time, be wary of comparing \"apples with oranges\" – cases in which there is little basis to compare because they are so different. Don't worry if this is not yet clear, as we will talk much more about the basis for valid comparisons in the early weeks of the course!</p>\n<p>Your comparative analysis should focus on two important aspects:</p>\n<p>(1) Why did your two cases take the approach that they did? If each jurisdiction took a different approach, how can we explain this?</p>\n<p>(2) What were the outcomes? And does one approach appear to have been more effective than the other? Why might this be the case? </p>\n<p>Note also that ~300-500 words of your assignment should be dedicated to discussing how you integrated the feedback from the Peer Feedback exercise into your assignment.
