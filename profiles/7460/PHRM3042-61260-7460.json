The three quizzes will progressively examine knowledge of the material covered in the first self-directed learning (SDL) module and in the practical classes. Each quiz will consist of 10 automatically marked questions. Up to 2 attempts per quiz are permitted, with the mark recorded for the purpose of final grading being the higher mark of the 2 attempts. The questions will be randomly drawn from a pool of questions for each quiz, so each quiz attempt may contain questions different from those used in a previous attempt. Online Quizzes will be available on the PHRM3042 Blackboard site. This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>QUIZ1 will be based on the self-directed learning (SDL1) occurring in Week 1 to test knowledge gained from completing the UQ extend module and self-directed learning. Quiz 1 opens Week 1 Tuesday 5 PM</p>\n<p>QUIZ2 will be based on Practical Schedule 1 (i.e. 1a and 1 b) and comprises 10 automatically marked questions (e.g. MCQ, drag and drop, etc...) to test the knowledge gained from the practicals and as part of self-directed learning. Quiz 2 opens Week 3 Tuesday 5 PM</p>\n<p>QUIZ3 will be based on Practical Schedule 2 (i.e. 2a and 2b) and comprises 10 automatically marked questions (e.g. MCQ, drag and drop, etc...) to test the knowledge gained from the practicals and as part of self-directed learning.
