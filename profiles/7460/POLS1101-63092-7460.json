Each post should be 200-250 words (and no longer). They are worth <strong>2 marks</strong> each. You should complete 6 posts across the semester. More detail on this aspect will be provided on the Blackboard at the beginning of semester. Your reflections will help inform tutorial discussions with your peers. </p>\n<p><strong>Part B: Participation (8 marks)</strong></p>\n<p>8 marks are granted for meaningful and participation in tutorials. Attend the tutorial (ensuring your attendance is registered by your tutor) and meaningfully participate in class discussions and activities. You may miss one week without penalty. Marks are for active participation. That is, preparing, engaging intelligently and contributing ideas and information. Simply turning up is NOT participation; if you attend all tutorials but never speak, you will get zero. Of course, meaningful and active participation can take many forms. While making a considered argument is a good way of demonstrating your engagement, so is asking a question of your tutor, considering a new idea in discussion with the person next to you or contributing to a group activity. Just make sure you come to class prepared and willing to engage respectfully with your fellow students.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you are not able to attend your tutorial in a given week for a valid reason (such as a documented illness or family emergency), you may complete a short piece of work to register your participation. For each missed week, record a 1.5-to-2 minute oral reflection on one of the readings for that week and send it to your tutor. In particular, you should outline a key challenge for Australian politics and/or society that emerges from the topic discussed in the reading: why is this a challenge and what might be done to solve or mitigate it?</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT).
