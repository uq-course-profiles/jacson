As well as explaining what you individually contributed to your team project, you should also include information around how these fit within the bigger picture of the entire project and what you would do differently, as well as any conflict resolution strategies that were applied and the outcomes (if applicable). This piece should demonstrate how you have developed your teamworking skills, such as teamwork strategies, abilities, etc. In the other sections of the portfolio, such as the reflections on seminars, the MOOC and the course as a whole, you should reflect on these individually. This will allow you to reflect on your own learning and experiences, rather than just those of your team. This reflective component is important so that you can demonstrate deeper learning.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
