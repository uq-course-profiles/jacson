            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Imagine that you have just been employed as a therapist to provide psychological services associated with an integrated health care program for a chronic or life limiting/threatening condition. The integrated clinic is to be associated with a local public tertiary hospital and will involve different health disciplines as required and serve a varied population group and catchment area. As part of the intervention program that is to be offered by the clinic, it has been determined that you are to provide a group format intervention to assist the psychological needs of the client population. Your role is to determine the approach that will be taken within your capacity as the provider of psychological services of the clinic. The group’s composition, organisation, format and content are totally under your control in its development.</p>\n<p>This assessment seeks to see you develop the skeleton outline of the group session(s) that you will offer as part of your program. Your program is to be based on a clear evidence-based consideration of the needs of this population with this condition as well as good principles of health promotion and adult learning.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>1. Identify your target group. Be specific. You can choose one from the areas below to work with or suggest one of your own (check with the course coordinator):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Chronic Pain Clinic</li>\n<li>Respiratory Clinic associated with conditions such as COPD</li>\n<li>Gastrointestinal Clinic associated with conditions such as FGIDs (Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders)</li>\n<li>Diabetes Clinic</li>\n<li>Cystic Fibrosis Clinic</li>\n<li>Weight Management in relation to a health condition</li>\n<li>Substance Abuse Service</li>\n<li>Cancer Services (or a specific Cancer type)</li>\n<li>Palliative Care Service</li>\n<li>Acquired Brain Injury Service</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2. Consider the broad literature and provide a summary of what are the specific <strong>needs </strong>of your target group (using BPSS framework) and what interventions may be beneficial to address their their psychological needs in a group setting. </p>\n<p>3. Develop 6-8 group sessions that best fit the psychological needs and include interventions suited to this group based on the literature summarised. For the approach overall, and for each session/activity, provide sufficient rationale using the empirical and theoretical literature for what you have included. For each session, you should develop a clear and relatively brief plan and outline (including a skeleton session plans and activity examples) of what you intend to undertake within your group sessions. The session plans and activities should provide enough detail that another health provider with your skillset can use this session plan to run a session successfully.</p>\n<p>4. You will need to demonstrate that you have considered the practical constraints of a hospital-based organisation with limited resources (such as staffing, budget, time, etc). You can assume that the clinic can allocate you three-four consulting rooms and a larger room as well as the support of administrative staff and access to technology through the hospital system.</p>\n<p>5. Make note of how you will monitor and evaluate the success of your approach/intervention over the 6-8 sessions.</p>\n<p>6. Ensure you consider group processes (dynamics, etc) when planning for your sessions. Make specific reference to this if needed.</p>\n<p>7. You should include examples of resources that are tailored for your specific client group and adapted for your audience. Consider what is 'user friendly' - think about jargon, visuals, and how this resource would be used by a client. You may borrow these from other programs (referenced appropriately), but be selective, and provide a rationale for what you are including and why. You may also develop your own resources if you so desire - this is a good activity in itself. If you want to add resources but are concerned about going over the word limit, they can be attached in an appendix and made reference to throughout.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
