The case study can be a project, an initiative, an industry, a place (e.g. suburb, city, country, developed or developing countries, etc), a group of people (e.g. a specific gender, social, cultural group, etc) etc. The conference presentation should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present an overview of the issue students researched in their research paper;</li>\n<li>Introduce the case study;</li>\n<li>Summarise the major social, economic and environmental dimensions of the case study; and</li>\n<li>Identify some solutions or recommendation for promoting sustainable development related to the case study and discuss some of the key challenges in providing the solutions/recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The presentation should be pithy and catchy.
