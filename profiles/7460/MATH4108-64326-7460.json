It will be non-invigilated and in the form of a PDF file that you will download from Blackboard. The final assessment is a take-home, open-book assignment. Students have to solve the assessment by themselves, though they are allowed to use any written and online resources (excluding online student forums and generative AI). You can print the assignment and write in the places provided (where applicable), or write your answers on blank paper, or write electronically on a suitable device. You will then scan or photograph your work if necessary and upload your answers to Blackboard as a single pdf file. You will be advised of a 24-hour period during the examination period when you must complete this assessment item. You can access and submit your paper at any time within the 24 hours. Even though you have the entire 24 hours to complete and submit this assessment, the expectation is that it will take students around 4 hours to complete. Note that late penalties will be strictly applied as described below.</p>\n<p>Note also that a deferred assignment will not be available. If you are unable to attempt the assessment item at the advertised time, then you must apply for an extension through the normal channels <strong>before accessing the question paper</strong>.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
