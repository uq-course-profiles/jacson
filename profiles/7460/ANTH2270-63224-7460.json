Based on this reading you will choose a specific contribution you want to highlight, e.g. a specific theorist, history of migration in a particular country, migration practice etc. and present this in the week that corresponds with your chosen topic as a shortened ignite talk. Ignite, and the similar format Pecha Kucha, are concise presentation styles which are starting to be used by academics to present to non-expert audiences. A full Ignite talk consists of 20 slides which are shown for 15 seconds each (Pecha Kucha has 20 slides, shown for 20 seconds each), the slides automatically advance so you cannot go into much detail. These presentation formats also use more imagery than text, which is useful for keeping audiences engaged. In this course, we will be using a shortened Ignite format where each presenter will be allowed 12 slides which will automatically advance every 15 seconds - 3 minutes in total. You will present these in class at class times and presentations will be recorded via echo360. We will discuss the format in detail in the first lecture. The focus is on learning to transmit crucial information informatively, concisely and both verbally and visually. This is a key transferrrable skill for 2nd/3rd year.</p>\n<p>You will prepare two such presentations over the course of the semester. Due dates will be negotiated in the first 2 weeks of semester. The first presentation will be worth 10% of the grade and the second one 20%.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
