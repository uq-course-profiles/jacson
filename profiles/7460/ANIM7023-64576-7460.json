The task challenges students to connect theoretical frameworks to practical, real-world issues presented by the speaker, fostering a deeper understanding and engagement with the subject matter.</p>\n<h4>Workshop Structure:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction (10 minutes)</strong>: A brief recap of Guest Speaker's presentation to set the context and focus of the workshop.</li>\n<li><strong>Group Discussion (30 minutes)</strong>: In groups of three to six, students will discuss the presentation in detail, identifying key issues and potential solutions to the human-wildlife conflicts presented. They are expected to explicitly connect these discussions to relevant concepts, theories, and frameworks covered in the preceding classes.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution Development (15 minutes)</strong>: Groups will develop a recommended course of action based on the insights gained from the class materials and the specific challenges highlighted by the guest speaker. These solutions should be evidence-based and theoretically grounded.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation (5 minutes per group)</strong>: One student from each group will present their findings and proposed solutions. The presentation should clearly demonstrate how theoretical knowledge has been applied to solve practical problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Deliverables:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>From each group</strong>: A jointly produced piece of butchers' paper, visually representing their proposed solutions and the theoretical frameworks they applied.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><br/></h4>\n<p><strong>Submission:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Written Report Requirement</strong>: Students  must submit a 500-word report analyzing the guest speaker’s presentation using the class concepts, theories, and frameworks.
