This assignment serves as the foundations of the ‘promote’ and ‘evaluate’ assignments which follow. For this assignment you will create your own social media content, based on one theoretical theme from weeks 1-4. By carefully considering your target audience, you will create content for specific users and gain insight into ways of critically understanding social media communication strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Part A – Planning Strategy (700 words):</strong></p>\n<p>Complete a ‘planning strategy’ document which outlines the following sections for your online exhibition using the template provided. Your planning strategy must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your objectives: </strong>What are you hoping to achieve through this video? For example, comments, likes, shares, click-throughs, views etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Target audience: </strong>Who is the target audience for this video?</li>\n<li><strong>Tactic: </strong>What is your communication and creative tactic to reach and engage this target audience?</li>\n<li><strong>Goal: </strong>What are you trying to get your target audience to do or think?</li>\n<li><strong>Questions:</strong> What is the message you want your viewers to take away? What do you want them to think about or discuss with friends? What change in behaviour or thinking are you trying to influence?</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation metrics: </strong>How will you measure the effectiveness of this video? For example: how many comments or likes or shares etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part B – Online exhibition video:</strong></p>\n<p>Create a ‘thought leadership’ style online video that is linked to one of the key themes as detailed in module one of the course (i.e. promotional culture, self-branding, creative participation). *You can opt to create one three one-minute video or three interconnected one-minute videos. </p>\n<p><strong>AI Use:</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
