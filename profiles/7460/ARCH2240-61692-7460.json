Topics or propositions will be distributed in the second or third lecture. This assessment exercise involves elements of both group and individual work. Students will be assessed individually, but one component of this assessment will reflect the quality and coherence of the entire team's response to the proposition. To ensure coherence and avoid duplication, students will initially need to work with their teams to develop a series of arguments in response to the proposition.</p>\n<p>Then, working individually, each student will develop and discuss one of these arguments. In addition to articulating their individual argument, the first speaker of each team will need to give a broad introduction to the topic and an overview of their team's response. Subsequent speakers will need to incorporate a rebuttal of the opposing team's argument into their discussion. In addition to their individual argument, the final speaker for each team will need to briefly conclude the team's argument. The arguments and discussions of the debates will reflect an understanding of the proposition in relation to issues raised in the course material.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to submit a digital copy of their debate text prior to their debate, and a printed copy of their debate text (including rebuttal notes) at the end of the debating session. Summative feedback will be provided in a timely manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment task to be completed without use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
