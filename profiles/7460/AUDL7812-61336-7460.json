You are required to give an oral presentation of a clinical report of your client as a case study during one of the seminars scheduled between week 5 and 8. The oral presentation will be presented as a powerpoint presentation of 8 minutes in length.  A copy of your powerpoint slides (in ppt or pdf format) must be sent to the Course Co-ordinator 3 days prior to your oral presentation by email (k.kei@uq.edu.au). That is, if you are going to present on Monday next week, you must send your powerpoint slides on Friday (on or before 5 pm) of the current week.</p>\n<p>Late submission of powerpoint slides will attract a penalty of 10% of the mark per day late (including weekends and public holidays), unless a formal extension has been organized prior to the due date. For example, if you send in your powerpoint slides on Monday (not 3 days prior) for your presentation, you will lose 30% of the total mark for your oral presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>How to choose a client for your case study</strong></p>\n<p>Of the clients you have tested through your Independent Clinical Practice, you may choose a suitable adult client with or without a hearing loss for your Case Study.
