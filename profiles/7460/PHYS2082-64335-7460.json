Describe how exoplanets are detected; calculate redshift and recession velocity. Calculate parallax distances to stars. Use distance to convert between flux & luminosity; use the magnitude scale. describe and contrast the main types of binary star system; calculate masses of stars in binary systems. Explain the Harvard system of spectral classification and spectral class, explain how spectral line strengths depend on temperature. Describe the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in detail and explain luminosity class. Describe the equilibrium equations of a stellar model and the possible energy sources for a star, describe the mechanisms of energy transport in stars; explain the Solar neutrino problem and how it was solved (chapters 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).EVOLUTION OF STARS: Describe interstellar dust extinction and hydrogen 21cm radiation, the ionization of Strömgren spheres. Describe star formation by gas cloud collapse, including the Jeans Mass and the radius. Describe exoplanet formation. Describe the evolution of sun-like stars. Calculate the distances of variable stars and explain Eddington's valve mechanism (chapters 12, 13, 14, 15, 23).STELLAR REMNANTS: Describe the structure of white dwarfs, and the Chandrasekhar mass. Describe the properties of a neutron star, how they are supported and their X-ray emission. Describe pulsars and core-collapse supernovae. Black hole escape velocity and Schwarzshild radius. Types of novae & supernovae; using supernovae as standard candles. Gravitational waves. (chapters 15, 16, 17, 18)."
