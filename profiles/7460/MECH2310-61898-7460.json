In the first hour of the tutorial, students are to work on the tutorial questions and the lecturer and members of the teaching team are available to answer question in the class. In the second hour of the tutorial, the first 30 minutes is allocated to the lecturer/memebers of the teaching team working together with students to answer all the tutorial questions. Then, in the last 20 minutes of the tutorial, an in class quiz will be done each week for 10 weeks. Each quiz is worth 2 marks in the total final marks.</p>\n<p>Each quiz contains one short answer question that is one of the tutorial questions in the same week and two multiple-choice questions. The short answer question is worth 1 mark in the total final marks, and each multiple-choice question is worth 0.5 mark in the total final marks.  Each multiple-choice question has four possible answers, in which only one is correct. Thus, only one answer can be selected. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
