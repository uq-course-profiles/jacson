If images help you articulate your ideas, you are welcome (but not required) to include them; if included, you must explicitly introduce, explain, and respond to these images in the body of your text, and they must include figure labels (e.g. ‘Figure 1’) and explanatory captions (neither included in the word count).</p>\n<p>Your submission must include references to at least five academic sources.

It must contain at least two of these elements: text, graphics, animation, video, sound, narration, and/or interactive functionality. Your digital story must be accompanied by a brief text-based personal reflection of no more than 150 words. This reflection may summarise what is included in your story, note what inspired the story, and/or speak to your own experiences with the story-making process. The reflection itself is not marked, but it will inform the marker's reception of your story. It is in essence an ‘artist's statement’ to contextualise your work.</p>\n<p>Storytelling is a personal experience. For this assessment, your experiences and/or perspectives should be the focus of your story. Do not tell someone else’s story – tell your own.</p>\n<p>You are being evaluated on your ability to produce a short digital story that effectively and affectively communicates an intended message. To do this, you will need to demonstrate knowledge of relevant theories and conventions related to narrative structures. Your submission does not need to include any academic references, but must clearly speak to core course concepts. To recall these course concepts, refer to the titles of the course's lectures. This assessment will require you to self-sufficiently direct some of your own media training; recommendations for training opportunities will be made available on the course's Learn page.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
