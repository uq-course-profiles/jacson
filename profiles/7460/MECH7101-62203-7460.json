The second session involves a simple experiment where students are given the opportunity to apply their developing skills in design of experiments to the scenario.

You should stay in the same laboratory group throughout semester, unless groups become unviable due to withdrawals or non-functional group dynamics. Please inform the Course Coordinator if such a situation appears to be developing. Conflicts within a group are nearly always resolved satisfactorily between group members without intervention from the academic staff, but do not hesitate to contact the Course Coordinator if incipient problems are not resolved in good time.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Design of Test Model</strong></p>\n<p>In the Experiment Test Model, students will prepare a design for a test model to be fabricated and used in experiments completed in the third laboratory session. This third laboratory session is held in Week 10. The test models must be designed and sent for fabrication prior to the testing session. Due to workshop fabrication constraints, the test model designs must be submitted to the workshop by the end of Week 6. Detailed instructions will be supplied on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Experimental Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The Experimental Plan submission will involve the development of an experimental plan and appropriate risk assessments for the testing to be completed in the third laboratory session. Detailed instructions will be supplied on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Experiment Final Report</strong></p>\n<p>This report contains the results and analysis of your final experimental testing campaign. It should include the logical reasoning by which the testing matrix was developed, identification of the governing non-dimensional parameters involved, and an analysis of the final results with reference to the parameters identified. A full error analysis should be contained of the uncertainty in the raw data collected, and in the compounded errors in the computed parameters. Couplings and trends of the output data should be identified, and where possible empirical correlations should be developed to quantify the outputs in a non-dimensional form with generic applicability that future workers in the field can use, without repeating another experimental program. Full details will be supplied on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Peer assessment of team member contributions (PAF)</strong></p>\n<p>Two peer assessments will be performed in Week 7 and 13. The results from the peer assessments will be used to scale all team marks, which account for 50% of the course.</p>\n<p>Peer assessment scores can decrease your individual score. No increase in score is possible. The purpose of the peer assessment is not to artificially elevate your personal score above the collective team. Peer assessment factors will be capped at 1.0 of the total team mark. There is no lower bound on the PAF (students that do not contribute to the team exercises can receive a zero).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The two peer assessment factors will be averaged unless there is an overwhelmingly compelling reason not to do so (at the discretion of the Course Coordinator). The first peer assessment will open in Week 6 and must be completed by Week 7. The second peer assessment will open in Week 12 and must be completed by Week 13. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
