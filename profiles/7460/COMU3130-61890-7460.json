Details on the client organisation will be provided in the lecture and tutorials.</p>\n<p>The public relations campaign is NOT hypothetical and will not be treated as such. This is your opportunity to show your creativity, backed by evidence or best practices. It is expected that each member of the peer group will sustain a strong level of team engagement, show respect for the opinions/input of others into decision-making, demonstrate a willingness to take on responsibilities and complete this on time, and adopt a collaborative approach (working well with all team members - avoiding passivity, submissiveness, or domination). Each member of the peer group is required to share equally in the development of the communication campaign creatives and in presenting them to the class. Information from academic sources should be used in the preparation of this assignment. Sources used should be acknowledged following APA style.
