If we have freely available low-cost carbon-free energy from renewable sources, who cares how much energy we use?</strong></p>\n<p><em>or</em></p>\n<p><strong>2. Government shouldn't worry about encouraging energy efficiency - no matter how efficient a device or appliance is, our <em>total</em> energy consumption won't go down - as appliances get more efficient, any energy savings are offset by the consumer buying additional appliances. (So for example, as fridges get more efficient, householders buy more fridges for their house - their total energy consumption or electricity bill stays the same).</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
