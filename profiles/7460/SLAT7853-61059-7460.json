The thesis length required is <strong>10,000 words</strong>, including figures, tables, footnotes, but <strong>excluding references and appendices</strong>. Theses longer than 12,000 words will be penalised. The thesis should encompass the following sections, allowing for some variation based on your specific research area:</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction (including rationale)</strong></p>\n<p>·        Clearly articulate the purpose and significance of your research.</p>\n<p>·        Provide a strong rationale for the chosen topic.</p>\n<p>·        Detail relevant concepts.</p>\n<p>·        Describe and exemplify the phenomenon you are investigating (if applicable).</p>\n<p>·        Provide the reader with a short description of the structure of your thesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>\n<p>·        Present a comprehensive review of relevant literature.</p>\n<p>·        Try the existing research to your research objective.</p>\n<p>·        Demonstrate a nuanced understanding of existing research in your field.</p>\n<p>·        Ensure smooth transitions between themes and sections.</p>\n<p>·        Conclude the literature review with a clear and specific statement of your research question(s), grounded in and motivated by existing research.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Methods</strong></p>\n<p>·        Outline the data collection process and methodologies employed.</p>\n<p>·        Provide detailed insights into your research design.</p>\n<p>·        Clearly describe the data and the data processing or selection of examples as well as the analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Results &amp; Discussion/Analysis &amp; Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>·        Present your findings, supported by figures and tables where applicable.</p>\n<p>·        Interpret the results in light of the existing, relevant literature.</p>\n<p>·        Engage in a thorough discussion or analysis of the results.</p>\n<p>·        Optionally, these can be presented as separate sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n<p>·        Summarize key findings.</p>\n<p>·        Evaluate any shortcomings or limitations of your study.</p>\n<p>·        Discuss the broader implications and potential avenues for future research.</p>\n<p><strong>Formatting Information</strong></p>\n<p>The thesis must align with the Dissertation template that will be made available via UQ Learn/Blackboard. Referencing must align with the APA7 (American Psychological Association) format protocol. While basic details may be found on the UQ Library site at http://www.library.uq.edu.au/training/citation/apa.pdf, for a thorough understanding of the protocol, refer to the American Psychological Association. (2010). Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, which is held in the library, call number Z253 .A38 2010.</p>\n<p>Any reference you use in your text MUST be cited appropriately (APA7 format) in the bibliography section of your thesis. NO OTHER references are to be put in the bibliography.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking Information</strong></p>\n<p>·        The dissertation will undergo evaluation by two examiners.</p>\n<p>·        The supervisor will receive and discuss examiners' reports during a meeting.</p>\n<p>·        The supervisor may address any concerns raised by the examiners.</p>\n<p>·        Students are encouraged to engage in discussions with the supervisor, either face-to-face or via email, to gain insights into their results.</p>\n<p><em>Please refer to the rubic (available via Blackboard/UQ Learn) for details on marking.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gen AI and MT Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
