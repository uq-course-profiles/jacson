Preface</strong></p>\n<p>Many firms encapsulate their ‘Sustainable Business Practices’ and ‘Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)’ activities within their sustainability reporting initiatives. In this assignment you will examine the sustainability reports of a specified firm. The objective is for you to develop and demonstrate your understanding of how sustainability reporting initiatives guide how firms engage in sustainable business practice. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Task Instructions, Word Limit and Report Structure</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each student will be assigned (via blackboard) a case study firm by the end of Week 1.</li>\n<li>Each student is required to complete the assignment on their assigned case study firm.</li>\n<li>No two students should complete the assignment on the same case study firm.</li>\n<li>Students who enrol after Week 1 or for whatever reason have not been assigned a case study firm by the end of Week 1, must email the course coordinator as soon as possible so they can be assigned a case study firm.</li>\n<li>Your task is to examine the sustainability reports of the case study firm and describe the ESG activities and sustainable business practices the firm has engaged in. To do this, you must follow the Report Structure outlined below and include the content listed in the Report Structure below for each relevant section.</li>\n<li>Case studies are a research method commonly used in environmental management. The format of case study analysis varies based on the research purpose and context. In this assignment, follow the Report Structure provided below. Case study analysis allows detailed examination and explanation of an interesting example of an important and often complex phenomenon. In this assignment, the interesting example is your case study firm, and the phenomenon is how the firm engages in sustainable business practice and sustainability reporting.</li>\n<li>The recommended word length for the assignment is 2500 words. This excludes the title, abstract, all figures and tables and their titles, footnotes, citations, and the reference list. There is no penalty for exceeding the recommended word limit.</li>\n<li>Your report must follow the Report Structure outlined below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <strong>Section</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Content</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Word Length</strong></p>\n<p>   Title</p>\n<p> You can choose your own title. Good titles have meaning and give the reader insight into what the report is about. For example, <em>‘Assignment 1 ENVM4525’</em> has no meaning, but this one does; <em>‘A study of how ANZ includes climate change related issues in its Environmental, Social and Governance reporting initiatives’.</em> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
