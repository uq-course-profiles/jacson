The tests will be available in Learn.UQ. You may attempt the test at any time during the week, but there will be a 20-minute time limit once you commence; it is thus recommended that you read each article thoroughly and attend the lecture before you commence the quiz. See Learn.UQ for more details.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Please note: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each week’s test is worth one per cent of your final mark.</li>\n<li>You get one single attempt at the quiz. If you have not completed the quiz within the 20-minutes of commencing, it will be autosubmitted on your behalf. </li>\n<li>Tests will not be reopened for students who experience technical difficulties, internet outages or other complications. Make sure you are in a suitable location with a stable internet connection and on a reliable computer before you commence the test. In our experience, students who swap between browser tabs, complete the test on a mobile device, or are multitasking tend to encounter completion issues so we recommended that you take care and only attempt the test under optimal conditions. Contact ITS for help if you have technical difficulties that you cannot resolve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
