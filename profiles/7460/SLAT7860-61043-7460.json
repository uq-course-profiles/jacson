Stage 1 requires you to select a technology/language learning focus and to write a rationale for your evaluation in essay style. Stage 2 requires you to prepare specific evaluation criteria, logically following on from what you have said in your essay in stage 1; this part is presented as an evaluation form or checklist. Stage 3 requires you to complete (i.e. actually fill in) your form or checklist for three apps, websites, software packages, or language learning environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1: A coherent rationale</strong></p>\n<p>Describe the topic of your evaluation study by outlining your language learning focus, your technology focus, your intended audience (school/university; adult/child etc.), and the reasons for your choice. For example, you might select YouTube videos with a culture learning focus, websites for vocabulary learning, social networking with a communication/fluency-building focus, wikis with a writing focus etc. etc. Then describe in broad terms the criteria for your evaluation with reference to the literature. Your criteria should identify particular features, qualities or characteristics that are important when judging value and effectiveness for language learning. Your criteria should be designed specifically according to your technology/language learning focus; for example, evaluation criteria that are especially constructed for use with vocabulary programs for learners of Japanese. Present your rationale in an 800 word essay.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2: A systematic approach</strong></p>\n<p>Based upon the general principles laid out in your essay, now produce an evaluation form with specific sections and criteria. This evaluation form should be presented in a format whereby a user can \"fill-it-in\", as described in Step 3 below. The form should be no longer than 4 A4 sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3: A practical use</strong></p>\n<p>This form should then be used to evaluate three items. For example, if your focus has been CALL websites and vocabulary learning, you have to find three suitable websites and then evaluate each one, filling in your form three times, with one form completed for each site. The three completed forms and the essay are all required to successfully complete this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>What you hand in:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rationale essay on evaluation criteria, 800 words</li>\n<li>Three completed evaluation forms</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p><strong>OPTION A: A podcast designed for language teachers</strong></p>\n<p>Scenario: A local radio station has asked you to develop a short podcast for a regular show based around the theme 'Teachers, learners and technology'. They want something that is informative and engaging that showcases the potential of a particular technology (or technologies) of your choice that is also practical for listeners who may be thinking of doing something similar. It is also important that you highlight the affordances of the technologies for different language skill and knowledge areas as well as holistically. They will be advertising the show to various language teacher networks nationally.</p>\n<p><strong>OPTION B: A podcast designed for language students</strong></p>\n<p>Scenario: You are teaching an intermediate/advanced language class and you have been requested by the Head of School to develop a series of weekly podcasts for this class to help them develop one of the main language skills (e.g. Listening, writing, speaking, grammar, etc). You are required to produce one podcast only as a sample. This podcast may be one from the beginning, middle or end of semester. You may specify more precisely the needs of your students and their goals and objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>OPTION A</strong> AND <strong>B: Further advice &amp; guidelines</strong></p>\n<p>Select a particular language teaching/learning focus and the needs and goals of the teachers/students you have in mind. Think about the structure of the overall podcast. I recommend you break down the 5-minute period into sections; decide on the amount of time for each section. Then think about exactly what you are going to present in each section. You will need to experiment. Also consider the following:</p>\n<p>• Making it clear in the introduction which podcast it is in the series (e.g., Podcast 3)</p>\n<p>• Keeping a good pace from section to section (not too boring)</p>\n<p>• Making your instructions to the students very clear so they know exactly what to do.</p>\n<p>Write a short individual reflective essay discussing the process and production of the podcast. Your reflection should:</p>\n<p>• Describe the teachers/students you had in mind and what you believed their learning goals/needs would be with regard to your podcast.</p>\n<p>• Describe your most influential experiences and references/readings that informed the design &amp; development of your podcast?</p>\n<p>• Describe what you have learnt as a result of the process (from evaluating the technology in relation to the language skill/area(s) to producing the podcast)?</p>\n<p><strong>Further guidelines</strong></p>\n<p>1. Creating and submitting your podcast. I don't really mind where or how you develop your podcast from a technical point of view but I do need to be able to access it easily. That means using common programs that are freely available and well known. <strong>KEEP A BACKUP COPY</strong>.</p>\n<p>2. Creating and submitting your critical reflection. Don't forget to check the assessment criteria details. Remember to keep a copy of every assessment task.</p>\n<p>3. Podcast can be audio only, PPT with audio, or video lecture.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
