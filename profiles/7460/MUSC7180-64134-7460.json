In searching for literature on this topic, <strong>you can only use articles published in the last three years.</strong> Your review must include a minimum of 8 articles and a maximum of 11. Articles must report research studies in music education (including systematic literature reviews), be sourced from reputable scholarly journals and be peer-reviewed. Articles must be relevant to the topic. You are encouraged to investigate more broadly than dedicated music education journals, but note the articles must reflect current music education research.</p>\n<p>Please present your submission in 2 parts within a single document:</p>\n<p>1. Annotated Bibliography (2200 words maximum)</p>\n<p>This is an alphabetised reference list with details of the articles you are critiquing. In the list you will include the following: Journal article citation (using APA7), followed by a 200-word annotation. Include in the annotation: Research Aims and Question/s; Research Method/s; Data Analysis, and Findings. Each annotation must provide a summary and a critical evaluation of the research. Do not reproduce the abstract.</p>\n<p>The annotation for each article should be 200 words. For the minimum requirement of 8 articles, a 200-word annotation makes a minimum word count for this component of the assessment 1600 words. The citation is not included in the word count. Provide a word count at the end of the bibliography.</p>\n<p>2. Critical literature review (1500 word maximum)</p>\n<p>A literature review is a type of academic writing that provides an overview of existing knowledge in a particular field of research. In this essay, provide a critical review of the 8-11 articles you sourced in the annotated bibliography. The review must firstly provide an outline of the topic you are investigating, followed by a critical analysis of the research findings in the selected literature. In your review you should: identify patterns of trends in the research reviewed, note any new knowledge in relation to the topic, identify any gaps or limitations in the research, and discuss the implications of the research findings for music educators. A good literature review summarises, analyses, evaluates and synthesises the relevant literature within a particular field.</p>\n<p>Present your essay in 12-point Times New Roman font (or other similar font), with double-spaced lines, paragraphs aligned to the left. Include the word count after each section. Include headers for each section, and include page numbers.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Other information</strong></p>\n<p>Follow appropriate formatting guidelines for APA7, including using 12-point Times New Roman font (or other similar font) in black, and double-space your lines. Use a hanging indent for your reference list ( which should be in alphabetical order) and justify the lines to the left.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Assist your group in coming to their own conclusions through participation in a thought-provoking workshop presented by you in a small discussion group (15-20 minutes). Your workshop should be interactive, engaging your peers with your chosen topic, and should keep strictly to the time limit. You must incorporate a resource/game/YouTube video created by you for your peers to ‘take home’ and use with their own students. The presentation and resource should be informed by the relevant Australian curricula or policy frameworks (state and federal), by current research in the topic (referenced throughout), and by your own practice as a music educator or student.
