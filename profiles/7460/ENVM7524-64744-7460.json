Preface</p>\n<p>Many firms are responding to society’s call for action on climate change by going ‘carbon neutral’. Indeed, terms like ‘carbon neutral’, ‘net zero’ and ‘carbon positive’ are often used interchangeably to describe how a firm estimates its reportable greenhouse gas emissions and then takes steps to reduce those emissions. Firms can emit and reduce emissions at different scales, have different emissions reduction priorities, use different emissions reduction methods and be at different stages in their pathway towards having zero net reportable emissions. In this assignment you will examine how a specified firm has estimated and reduced its reportable emissions. The objective is for you to develop and demonstrate your understanding of the actions and issues involved in the process of carbon management.</p>\n<p>2. Task Instructions, Word Limit and Report Structure</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each student will be assigned (via blackboard) a case study firm by the end of Week 1.</li>\n<li>Each student is required to complete the assignment on their assigned case study firm.</li>\n<li>No two students should complete the assignment on the same case study firm.</li>\n<li>Students who enroll after Week 1 or for whatever reason have not been assigned a case study firm by the end of Week 1, must email the course coordinator as soon as possible so they can be assigned a case study firm.</li>\n<li>Your task is to examine how your case study firm has estimated and reduced its reportable greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, you must follow the Report Structure outlined below and include the content listed in the Report Structure below for each relevant section.</li>\n<li>Case studies are a research method commonly used in environmental management. The format of case study analysis varies based on the research purpose and context. In this assignment, follow the Report Structure provided below. Case study analysis allows detailed examination and explanation of an interesting example of an important and often complex phenomenon. In this assignment, the interesting example is your case study firm, and the phenomenon is how the firm engages in the process of estimating and reducing its net reportable greenhouse gas emissions.</li>\n<li>The recommended word length for the assignment is 2500 words. This excludes the title, abstract, all figures and tables and their titles, footnotes, citations, and the reference list. There is no penalty for exceeding the recommended word limit.</li>\n<li>Your report must follow the Report Structure outlined below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Section</p>\n<p>Content</p>\n<p>Word Length 3500</p>\n<p>Title</p>\n<p>You can choose your own title. Good titles have meaning and give the reader insight into what the report is about. For example,</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
