They will post a question/answer and be marked based on an objective rubric provided in the course. It is meant as an easy first assignment that teaches students how to ask good mathematical questions. It will be very useful in life, research, and in higher degree coursework. It will allow students to build confidence in the language of natural resource mathematics without worrying about mathematical rigour and correctness. Mathematical rigour and accuracy (as required in any maths course) will be assessed in the other assessment items. Note assignment questions will differ for the co-badged graduate-level natural resource mathematics course, yet the structure of the assessment dates will be the same.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It is similar to an assignment. You will answer two to four questions on material covered in previous assignments, lectures, practicals, and lecture notes. You may consult all official course materials while working on the assignment. External sources can also be used, but must be cited, and presented in your own words. All technical words or concepts not defined in the lecture must be defined explicitly in your solutions. For example, you may use theorems presented in this course (or a pre-requisite course) without proof, but, if you are using a theorem from outside of the course or prerequisite material, you must prove the theorem in your solution, or you will receive a zero on that problem.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The assessment should take approximately 8 hours of work for a student with a strong command of the course material (This does not include the time required to study or review material). However, we are giving a week to complete it to account for the fact that students may have conflicts during any specific 8-hour block of time. The release date is Nov 4th at 9:30am.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>There will be no deferred assignment. You can only apply for an extension to assessment as a request online. You must BOTH send an email to the coordinator and file an official request through my.uq. It is expected that students may have up to two other final exams that overlap the assessment period. However, for students with more than two other exams during this time, an extension can be applied for and is considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
