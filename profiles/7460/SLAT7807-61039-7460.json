You should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain your thoughts and feelings about your experiences;</li>\n<li>Analyse and evaluate why you had these responses;</li>\n<li>Draw conclusions about what influences your thinking, and</li>\n<li>Create a plan of action for the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Task 2 – Reading assignment</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this task is to prepare for class each week. <strong>You are required to watch the online lecture and complete assigned reading(s) and answer a few questions about the key concepts/main points in the lecture and reading. </strong>The questions will help you to find where you should focus on when preparing for class and understand the research presented in the article presentation (Week 3-13).</p>\n<p>Each assignment is available weekly, for seven days, from 5 pm on Wednesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you complete both Reflection and Reading Assignments with high quality, you will receive the full 10 marks (3 marks for Reflection, and 7 marks for the Reading Assignment).</li>\n<li>For the Reflection assignment, your entry is assessed according to the rubric available in Blackboard.</li>\n<li>For the Reading assignment, if you do <strong>not answer all reading questions </strong>in the Reading Assignment, you only get <strong>a portion (e.g.,1</strong>). If the similarity score is too high, your score will be penalised.</li>\n<li>For summary and critique of the article (the second part of the Reading Assignment), <strong>sufficient details and critical analysis </strong>earn a <strong>full 3 mark</strong>, but if<strong> the summary is not well composed </strong>(in terms of content, language, length, comprehension) and critical analysis does not show your the summary is given <strong>2 mark</strong>, and if <strong>the summary is poorly composed </strong>(in terms of language, length and comprehension) it earns <strong>0 mark</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the similarity score of your answers to the reading questions and summary of the article, you will be penalised. Please check the similarity score before you submit it by submitting your answers to Turnitin.</li>\n<li>There are 12 assignments in total. You will get the 10 best scores out of 12 assignments. If you receive 10 each week, you won't have to complete the final two assessments. Or your score for all 12 weeks' assignments will NOT be totalled, but only the 10 best scores will be considered for the final marks. Your entry of the two tasks (i.e., reflection and answers to the questions) will be credited to your assessment. You are expected to submit 10 reflections and reading assignments at a minimum (out of 12). The maximum assignment score for each week is 10. The maximum of the total 10 assignments is 100 which will be converted to 15.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Statement on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.
