Generally, if a particle acts as a nucleant, it should be within the grain (not on grain boundaries) and there is a particular OR between the particle and the grain. Hence, it is necessary to experimentally determine the OR(s) between the Al3Ti and the α-Al matric to achieve this task. It is required to specify how and/OR can be determined.</li>\n<li>To characterize the fracture surfaces of the tensile test samples after the test has been done (samples are broken) to investigate the difference of the fracture (ductile dimples or brittle cleavage fracture) between the 3D printed samples with and without inoculation treatment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each specific task, students should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>select the most suitable instruments; (5 marks)</li>\n<li>design/choose the best technique with that chosen instrument; (10 marks)</li>\n<li>clearly justify why this instrument and this technique are used.
