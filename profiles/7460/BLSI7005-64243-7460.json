Be specific providing examples to illustrate.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this assessment is not only to demonstrate your understanding of value cocreation as one of the underlying concepts to the program, but also to assess your ability to write academically (including the use of references), which will be a core skill developed and assessed over the program.</p>\n<p>The recommended length of this assessment is 1,500 - 2,000 words.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
