This observation will be in a public place of your own choosing. Possible public places include: Botanic Gardens, food courts, South Bank, a Café, town square, or a bus stop. </p>\n<p>During the observation you must use your senses to take notes about visual, audio and olfactory (i.e. smell) aspects of your chosen fieldsite in order to describe the place in a way which transports your reader into the setting, in as few words as possible.</p>\n<p>Secondly, you must also practice 'seeing' like an ethnographer and providing a narrative description based on your observations of human behaviour which makes reference to 1 relevant article of your choosing in anthropology. What are people doing in your setting? Spend your time writing as well as watching, trying to capture details such as snippets of conversation, details about people's dress or behaviour, and anything else that strikes you as interesting. You may wish to take a photograph of the general setting as well if you can, but make sure this is not a close-up or easily identifiable photo of any individual person. </p>\n<p>The 750 word Observation Description will not be your actual observation notes made during the observation. Rather, what you submit as a description will be an organised form of your notes, written up for a reader in a way which relates your observation to one article of your choosing from your reading in anthropology. It could be categorised under headings such as visual, audio, olfactory, or you can find another structure that works for your data. You must try to be as detailed and succinct as possible, asking yourself - what is the significant of social behaviour in this public place, and how does the article you have chosen help you make sense of what is happening?</p>\n<p>We will prepare for the observation exercise during the tutorials, but potential questions to consider include:</p>\n<p> i.     Visual: How are people dressed? Do people with the same dress sit/walk/stand together? How many people form a group? For how long are they together? What are people doing? Do people interact? In what ways? Are groups composed of different genders? What does the physical environment look like? Does this influence social interaction?</p>\n<p>ii.     Audio: What do you hear? What do these sounds do to the ‘feel’ of the place? Do these sounds impact the way people behave?</p>\n<p>iii.     Olfactory (smell): What do you smell? Where do these smells come from? Do they impact the ‘feel’ of the place?</p>\n<p>Your observation should include a title. You may also wish to include a photograph of the setting to illustrate your prose.</p>\n<p>All written assessment pieces must include a title, your full name, student number.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The assessment asks you to interview a friend or family member, take notes, analyse the notes by 'coding' them, engage in literature research, and write an essay.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your essay should be a maximum of 1500 words (+/- 10%, excluding references) and is worth 45%</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>All essays must include a title, your name, student number, page numbers, and be in Times New Roman 12 pt font. Essays must be properly referenced in APA 7 style (<a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">UQ Library Guide</a> ; <a href=\"https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/reference-guide.pdf\">APA 7 Quick Reference Guide</a>), with at least 4 <strong>anthropology sources</strong> (they can be found on recognised electronic academic journals, but not news websites or crowd-sourced encyclopaedias such as Wikipedia).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Choose one of the two topics, or the alternative assessment below.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Topic 1: Religion</strong></p>\n<p>Interview a close friend or relative about religion, spirituality, everyday rituals and practices, important holy days or rites of passage, or any other aspect of religious life. Consider how this may reflect broader sociocultural and/or historical conditions or realities. Re-consider the lecture and reading material from <strong>week 10</strong> to help you think of a line of questioning. Your essay must include a kinship diagram in which you ‘map’ any connections between members of the family to which your interviewee refers (for example, if you were interested how your interviewee got into the religious tradition they are part of, or an rite of passage like a weddings ceremony or a religious feast, where family members are involved). Your essay must also reference at least <strong>four academic anthropological sources</strong> such as journal articles, book chapters, or books. The essay must conclude with a question for further research and/or a tentative finding about the religious matters you investigated.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Topic 2: Economics</strong></p>\n<p>Interview a close friend or relative about trade, money, value, labour, or some other aspect of economic life and consider how this may reflect broader sociocultural and/or historical conditions or realities. Re-consider the lecture and reading material from <strong>week 7</strong> to help you think of a line of questioning. Your essay must include a kinship diagram in which you 'map' any connections between members of the family to which your interviewee refers (for example, if you were interested in the lines of inheritance of material wealth, the values in a family business, or the labour choices among family members). Your essay must also reference at least <strong>four academic anthropological sources</strong> such as journal articles, book chapters, or books. The essay must conclude with a question or tentative finding about the economic matters you investigated. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Alternative assessment - How does the anthropological study of politics and economics shed light on the concept of modern slavery?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are unable to undertake your own interview, you may draw on the interview about modern slavery discussed in lectures and tutorials. Your essay must consider how the concept of modern slavery relates to the experience of Pacifica labourers in Australia historically and today. You need to use <strong>additional academic literature</strong> to explain and frame this history. Moreover, using an interview conducted by somebody else has certain <strong>methodological implications</strong> that you need to reflect on in your essay. Does this change your understanding of anthropological methods, and, if so, how? Your essay must engage with the anthropological discussions of politics and economics in the lectures and tutorials in this course, and reference at least <strong>four academic anthropology sources</strong>. Further details will be provided via Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Essay structure</p>\n<p>Your essay <strong>must</strong> <strong>include</strong> all of the following (although not necessarily in this order): </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1. Essay title (be creative!)</p>\n<p>2. Introduction</p>\n<p>3. A description of the key findings from the interview. You may use literature here, but the emphasis should be on the description of main themes that arose from your conversation/interview.</p>\n<p>4. Kinship diagram (however small or brief) of persons mentioned in the interview. Remember to give it a caption.</p>\n<p>5. A literature review of anthropological material relevant to the topic – this will be anthropology of religion, economy, or political anthropology depending on the themes of the interview.</p>\n<p>6. Discussion and Conclusion. Drawing together the previous sections, a discussion will outline how your data may be understood in relation to the anthropological literature. Take care to pose this <em>as a question</em>, or at least be careful of generalisations and causation (given the range of your research).</p>\n<p>7. Reference list. Your essay needs to cite at least <strong>4 academic anthropology</strong> <strong>sources</strong> using APA style. These need to be listed under a heading 'References Cited' at the end of your essay. Sources must be from (preferably peer-reviewed) academic publications.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>APPENDIX</strong>: Coded notes (max 2 pages).The sample of Coded notes must be submitted at the same time as the essay and in the same document. Students receive training on how to code their notes (see online workshop 5) and guidance in tutorials. Coded notes MUST include references to relevant (anthropological) pieces of literature . Coded notes will be submitted via TurnitIn as an appendix to the essay in the same document.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Diagram Instructions</p>\n<p>As noted, your essay must include a kinship diagram where you depict all members of the family you discuss mentioned in the essay. The names can be psuedonyms or first names only. Any individuals referred to within the essay should be clearly identifiable in the diagram, but this is not a 'family tree', rather you are using the diagram as an illustration of a key point in the essay. Using Microsoft Word (or other) drawing tools (or drawing by hand and photographing) Use standard anthropological symbols in the diagram as discussed in <strong>week 4</strong> lecture and practiced the tutorials.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Identify EGO (your interviewee) in the diagram.</p>\n<p>Use standard anthropological symbols as outlined in lectures and tutorials, these include:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>-        triangle for male</p>\n<p>-        circle for females</p>\n<p>-        Square for third or unknown gender = for marriage/union</p>\n<p>-        ≠ to represent divorce or separation.</p>\n<p>-        \\ or X through a deceased person dotted vertical line to represent adoption</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Identify relatives with kinship terms from EGO’s perspective in whatever language is used within the family. E.g. ‘nan’, ‘pop’. Add these terms underneath the triangle/circle in the diagram.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
