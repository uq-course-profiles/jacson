            "topic_description": "Seminar 7: Gender, sex work and trafficking Some gender scholars describe the current international traffic in sex as a hidden dimension of the international political economy. Certainly the transnational trade in sex and sex tourism is an important dimension of contemporary globalisation. While some condemn the spread of prostitution others contend it is a trade like any other and workers within this industry should qualify for rights protection and industry regulation. What are the central debates evident within the literature on gender and prostitution? Are all workers in this industry content to be viewed as victims? What is the relationship between neoliberal morality and sex trafficking? See blackboard for list of essential and supplementary readings.",

This lecture will place globalized writing on these questions in dialogue with ethnographic work which discusses the tensions that occur when transnational campaigns opposed to discrimination on the basis of sexuality become grounded in the localized context.
