For full details, including the marking rubric, please refer to the course Learn UQ (Blackboard) site</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Policies are often thought about as solutions to ‘problems’. Bacchi’s (2009) ‘What’s the problem represented to be?’ (WPR) approach challenges this idea. It suggests that policy solutions actually create or give shape to ‘problems’ by representing them in particular ways. When we analyse a solution that is offered to ‘fix’ a ‘problem’, we can learn something about how the problem is being thought about, that is, being represented. The WPR approach outlines a series of questions that can be used as a framework to analyse policy solutions and uncover what the problem is represented to be within them.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task requires you to explain Bacchi’s (2009) WPR approach and then apply it to analyse social policy. Specifically, you will use WPR questions 1, 2 and 4 to analyse the policy statement of an Australian political party on a particular social policy issue.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The topic options for this assignment will become available on UQ.Learn (Blackboard) in Week 3.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
