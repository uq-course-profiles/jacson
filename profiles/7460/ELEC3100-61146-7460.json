Each tutorial will consist of several problems provided prior to the tutorial sessions. During the tutorial session, students will demonstrate a solution to one of the problems from the assessed tutorial problem set (excluding the Matlab problem), as selected by their demonstrator, as well as discuss the results of their Matlab simulation. A brief one-on-one discussion with the tutoring staff on the selected problem will occur, with the student being awarded between 0 and full marks. Each tutorial has a weighting of 4.0%. Students can accumulate a maximum of 40% from the problem demonstration. We will use your top 10 tutorials. </p>\n<p>One problem will be a simple MATLAB task. Either demonstrate this code running on your personal laptop (preferred) or print the output/results.</p>\n<p>It is not expected that all students will have complete and correct solutions prior to attending a tutorial session. The expectation of students is that you will have made an attempt to answer all questions prior to your tutorial session and that you will work to correct any errors or misunderstandings of the course content during your session.</p>\n<p>If you have fully completed the assigned problems and wish to get marked off at the start of the session, the onus is on you to demonstrate your understanding of the content to the demonstrator.</p>\n<p>If you are having trouble with the concepts or any of the tutorial problems, feel free to remain for the full duration of the session. As the tutorial progresses and more people are marked off and leave, you will likely be able to receive direct attention from any of the demonstrators.</p>\n<p>The assessed problem set will be provided weekly after the lectures, in the week prior to tutorial sessions. </p>\n<p>This activity will only occur during the tutorial sessions.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
