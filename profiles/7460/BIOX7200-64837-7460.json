The student should decide on a scientific area that aligns with their Masters program and that interests them. Before the first week of semester the student should secure a supervisor. There are many avenues to identify a potential supervisor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>searching the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences website (<a href=\"https://scmb.uq.edu.au/\">scmb.uq.edu.au</a> )</li>\n<li>consult the SCMB Research Projects booklet (<a href=\"https://scmb.uq.edu.au/study/postgraduate-coursework\">scmb.uq.edu.au/study/postgraduate-coursework</a> )</li>\n<li>the web pages of the various research institutes at UQ, links to those web pages can be found here <a href=\"https://research.uq.edu.au/\">https://research.uq.edu.au/</a></li>\n<li>the UQ Researchers website (<a href=\"https://researchers.uq.edu.au/\">https://researchers.uq.edu.au/</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should contact prospective supervisors and ask whether they have time to supervise your project proposal. Supervision will involve meeting with you at least 5 times during semester to discuss your progress and help you with any difficulties you have encountered. Your supervisor must sign the <a href=\"https://scmb.uq.edu.au/files/18632/SCMB%20Postgraduate%20Coursework%20Supervisor%20Approval%20Form%20-%20Jan%202022.pdf\">SCMB Postgraduate Coursework Supervisor Approval Form</a>.</p>\n<p>2. Once you have had an introductory meeting with your supervisor and established the area of research for your proposal, you should begin looking for key papers. This will involve searching the various library databases (<em>e.g.</em> PubMed) for relevant papers. If you are not familiar with these databases, you should enrol in one of the short courses offered by the library. Please ask at the Information desk or contact the UQ library online (<a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/contact-us\">https://web.library.uq.edu.au/contact-us</a> ) and indicate that you are a postgraduate student. You should then further discuss your proposal with your supervisor to confirm that the research is of current interest to the field.</p>\n<p>You are required to write a research proposal which focuses on future directions of a research topic based on the literature or a past/ongoing research project.</p>\n<p>Assume you are writing an application to fund a PhD scholarship or research grant to employ you as a full-time researcher for about 3 years. Hence, the proposal should be written to convince other scientists (who will assess the application) that the proposed research will address issues of substance that have a realistic chance of being completed in 3 years.</p>\n<p>Assume you are working in a laboratory already set up with the general infrastructure (laboratory setup, equipment and support staff) for the sort of work you envisage.</p>\n<p>You are expected to spend the equivalent of 10 hours per week over a semester on the assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
