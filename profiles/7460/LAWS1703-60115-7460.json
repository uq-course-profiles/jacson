It has taken several different formats, including a standard essay, a media reflection (finding contemporary media reports to reflect on a particular public law issue), a critical discussion of a particular law or case (eg, Covid directions), a mock legal argument (for a hypothetical court case in public law) and a law reform submission.</p>\n<p>The assignment is due on Monday 9 September at 2pm. </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). The point of this assessment is to help you to develop your own legal knowledge and skills in writing, researching and making arguments.
