Communicate your preliminary findings to others. Prepare you for writing a language analysis paper as the final course paper.   </p>\n<p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Make a video explaining to others (instructors and students in CHIN2600) how the theories/concepts you have learned from CHIN2600 can be used to explain a problem in your social life. You are highly encouraged to develop this video project into your final analysis report, which will focus on data analysis and proposed solutions.  </p>\n<p><strong>Details: </strong>You will need to identity a research topic about real-world, language-based problems; explain why it is a problem by including all aspects; justify why the problems are critical by reviewing existing discussions; connect the problems to an aspect of Chinese language discussed in the class; explain which theory or concept taught in class can better explain the problems; collect some “social interactional” data to illustrate the problem (e.g., recordings of social interactions or online discussion); use concepts/theories taught in class to analyse two examples from the data; and present your findings.       </p>\n<p><strong>Format: </strong>You will need to create a video using voice-over-powerpoint (or similar). Zoom recording can support this purpose. You also want to make sure that your face is shown in the video.   </p>\n<p><strong>Submission: </strong>Upload your video to Blackboard (CHIN2600 Blackboard &gt; Assessment &gt; Video Project &gt; Video Submission). If you are unable to upload the video to blackboard, copy and paste and submit the URL of the video to blackboard.

Why is it important?  </p>\n<p>2.     What is the current discussion about the problem (e.g., news media, online survey, or ethnographic interview)?   </p>\n<p>3.     Which aspects of language use covered in CHIN2600 are relevant to the problem? </p>\n<p>4.     What theories or concepts taught in the class can be used to better understand the problem (and help you come up with solutions in the final project)?   </p>\n<p>5.     What is your language data? How will they be collected?</p>\n<p>6.     Use theories or concepts taught in the class to analyze two examples from the data. </p>\n<p>7.     What did you learn from this project (e.g., reflect critically on your analysis or the strengths, weaknesses, or problems of the theories)?   </p>\n<p>8.     What is the take-home message of the presentation?  </p>\n<p>You should make extensive research on your topic and show your understanding in the presentation with social interactional examples. Make your presentation engaging and insightful.</p>\n<p><strong>Language: </strong>English or Mandarin Chinese</p>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> 8 minutes.
