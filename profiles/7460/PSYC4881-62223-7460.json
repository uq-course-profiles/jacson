The journal entries from the second half of the semester must be finalised BEFORE 12PM (noon 12:00:00 sharp) of Wednesday in Week 13. These are the final due dates by which each batch of journal entries must be finalised (e.g., if you didn't have time to log journal entry #1 before Wednesday 12PM of Week 2, you can do this anytime before Wednesday 12PM of Week 7 for it to be considered toward the assessment mark). Within each batch, only the marks from your top 4 of 5 journal entries will count toward your final mark. Late submissions will not receive any marks.
