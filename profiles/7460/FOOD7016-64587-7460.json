The first member examines the case study and identifies an appropriate sensory evaluation method. The second member elaborates on conducting the sensory evaluation session, including guidelines for the environment, sample presentation, and evaluator instructions. Another member analyses data using a suitable statistical technique to identify significant product differences. The fourth member identifies precautions to be taken during the sensory evaluation session, addressing potential biases, participant recruitment, training, ethics, and data integrity. The group concludes by combining their findings and demonstrating their collective understanding of sensory evaluation, study design, data analysis, and precautions for obtaining reliable results.</p>\n<p><strong>Details of the Case Study</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is group work. Each group comprising four students (self-selected using the course Blackboard site) will investigate a sensory evaluation case study assigned to them. From teaching weeks 1 to 8, each group will come together, discuss the case study, analyse and interpret the sensory data, and consult associated reading materials, library databases, books, and original research papers to collate relevant information and submit the critically discussed case study through Turnitin. Since this is group work, individual contributions to teamwork will be evaluated by each group member for the other three. I will be available to answer questions and guide your group during the sensory practical sessions.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The critically discussed case study [(Font: Arial, Font Size 12, Line spacing: 1.5), maximum of 4000 ± 10% words excludes References, Figures. Tables and Appendix] </strong>will contain the following sections -</p>\n<p>(1) <strong>Title</strong>: Include the Case Study details and <strong>each group member’s name and student number</strong>.</p>\n<p>(2) <strong>Case Study Analysis (<em>Individual task</em>)</strong>: Group member 1 will examine the given case study, considering the variables involved and the nature of the data, to identify an appropriate sensory evaluation method that applies to the case study, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the case study requirements.</p>\n<p>(3) <strong>Conducting the Sensory Evaluation Session (<em>Individual task</em>)</strong>: Group member 2 will elaborate on how the sensory evaluation session will be conducted. They should outline the step-by-step process, including considerations for the environment, sample presentation, evaluation forms, and specific instructions for the evaluators. Clear guidelines should be provided to ensure a well-structured and consistent session for obtaining reliable and accurate data.</p>\n<p>(4) <strong>Data Analysis (<em>Individual task</em>)</strong>: Group member 3 will analyse the sensory data provided to them. They will carefully examine the data and apply an appropriate statistical technique to identify significant differences between the products under investigation. Group member 3 should provide a detailed analysis, interpret the data, and draw meaningful conclusions based on the results obtained from the sensory evaluation session.</p>\n<p>(5) <strong>Precautions during the Sensory Evaluation Session (<em>Individual task</em>)</strong>: Group member 4 will be responsible for identifying and addressing the precautions that should be taken during the sensory evaluation session. They should consider potential sources of bias or errors and provide strategies to reduce them. Group member 4 should outline precautions related to standardisation of the evaluation environment, bias control, participant recruitment and selection, training and calibration of evaluators, ethical considerations, and data integrity.</p>\n<p>(6) <strong>Conclusion (<em>Group work</em>)</strong>: In the conclusion, the four students should combine their findings from each part and present a cohesive summary. They should integrate the results of the data analysis, the process of conducting the sensory evaluation session, and the precautions provided. The conclusion should demonstrate the group's collective understanding of sensory evaluation, their ability to design and conduct a well-structured sensory evaluation session, analyse data, and their awareness of the precautions necessary for obtaining reliable results.</p>\n<p>(7) <strong>Bibliography/References</strong>: From all sources of information (published in the last 15 years). References should be appropriately cited in the text and listed in the bibliography at the end of the report using the<strong> Vancouver referencing style</strong>.</p>\n<p>(8) <strong>Appendix</strong>: Include the raw sensory data.</p>\n<p><strong>Each group must work through week 1-7 and complete the case study</strong>. The individual tasks are worth 14%, groupwork is 3%, and peer assessment is 3%. How, as a group, you discuss and analyse the case study and the sensory data and interpret the results will decide your group work. The contributions to the report will be evaluated by each group member for the other three members (<strong>peer assessment</strong>). One group member can volunteer to submit the case study on behalf of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note: <em>The sensory practical sessions are a major part of this course and provide a hands-on understanding of the theoretical knowledge you will gain through the lectures</em>. <em>Practical Classes are scheduled weekly, lasting approximately 1.5 hours. These sessions are laboratory-based activities. Attendance and completion of the associated tasks are mandatory to receive a grade for the Sensory Evaluation Report. Participation in practical classes is essential for your assignment to be marked and graded.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking: </strong>Refer to the Course Blackboard Site.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
