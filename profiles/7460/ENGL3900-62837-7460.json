This involves more than simply showing up. You should ensure that you prepare for class by reading each week’s set text in full before attending. </p>\n<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>\n<p>You will be allocated a participation mark based on the quality of your contribution to each tutorial you attend. </p>\n<p>While lecture attendance is not formally recorded, it is critical that you attend lectures (or listen to the recorded lectures) in order to achieve the highest possible mark for this participation task. The quality of the contributions you are able to offer in tutorials will, after all, significantly depend on your command of the lecture material. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI/MT: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
