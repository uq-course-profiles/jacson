Students will form small research groups (3-4 persons) to evaluate literature and critically discuss in class core research sub-themes about two different regional place settings in Australia. Students will individually synthesise their own critical summaries on key themes in their research journal covering wellbeing, place, culture and climate comparing evidence-based information from Queensland and Northern Territory on the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dimensions of Indigenous social housing and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Australian, regional and remote geographies and climatic zones</li>\n<li>Gununa and Jurnkkurakurr infrastructure settings</li>\n<li>Indigenous housing cultures, supply and needs</li>\n<li>Culturally responsive housing design</li>\n<li>Regional housing statistics</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI or MT to support learning: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
