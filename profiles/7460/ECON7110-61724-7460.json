The purpose of this <strong>INDIVIDUAL</strong> essay is to analyse a local or international piece of news within your assigned category. You have to use all the concepts and tools learned in the course to successfully complete this task. The essay must contain the following sections:</p>\n<p>1. Summary of the chosen news in a bullet style.</p>\n<p>2. Background.</p>\n<p>3. Analysis A &amp; Analysis B.</p>\n<p>   3.1 Who or which parties are affected by the policy covered in the news? How are they affected?</p>\n<p>   3.2 Why and how the government, or any other third party, did influence the outcome?</p>\n<p>4. Recommendation</p>\n<p>5. Appendix</p>\n<p>  5.1 Lists of Figures</p>\n<p>  5.2 Reference</p>\n<p>  5.3 News attachment</p>\n<p>The news article <strong>MUST</strong> be published after January 2023 and must be in English. No two students assigned to the same category are allowed to choose the same or similar news article. Penalty rates will apply in such a case (see below). </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p><strong>How to reserve the news article</strong></p>\n<p>The reservation of a news article is based on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p>\n<p>Within each group, the course coordinator will create a form titled \"Reserved Article.\" Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> create another forum. To avoid any confusion, any article reserved using a different forum will not be considered. </p>\n<p>Each student must create a thread within the \"Reserved Article\" forum to reserve his/her own article. Students must use the template provided to enter the information on the news regarding the headline, source, publishing date, and the link (if available). It is your responsibility to make sure that your chosen article is not the same or too similar to the ones reserved in earlier threads. Any doubts should be directed to the course coordinator. Further information is available on the forum. </p>\n<p>RULES (MUST READ)</p>\n<p>Each student must reserve the news article according to the assigned category. See above for details. Failure to do so might be subjected to a penalty rate.</p>\n<p>No computer-related problems are allowed as an excuse to miss the deadline. It is highly recommended that you attempt to submit the file at least a day prior to the deadline.</p>\n<p>ALL the relevant references must be provided. This is VERY IMPORTANT. Any figures and content taken from other sources must be cited appropriately. Failure to do so may potentially lead to an academic integrity investigation.</p>\n<p>Please use the APA (American Psychological Association) style rules for references. The essay is limited to a 2,500-3,000 word count (excluding references, figures, and the news attachment). Any analysis beyond the 3,000 words count will be disregarded.</p>\n<p>Check very carefully to ENSURE that the correct/updated file is uploaded through the Turn-it-in by the due date.** You can re-upload the file as many times as you wish, as long as the due date has not yet been passed.</p>\n<p>I do not accept any submission via other platforms such as hard-copy or email. The submission of the wrong file through the Turn-it-in is not an acceptable excuse to ask for a resubmission after the due date. </p>\n<p>More detailed information about this assessment and its marking scheme will be posted on Blackboard at the start of the semester.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
