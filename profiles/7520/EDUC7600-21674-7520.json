The task asked of you is to <strong>engage in a 45-minute-long focused conversation </strong>with either your carer/ parents, or other parents/carers within your family or social network. If you live in a different city or country, consider the possibilities of using phone or other technology-mediated communication to interview your chosen persons. </p>\n<p>It may not be possible for you to contact and communicate with your family and if this is so, please be assured that you will not be disadvantaged if you choose not to interview your family of origin. If you anticipate experiencing any difficulties with this assignment, please seek advice on alternatives from your Tutor or the Course Coordinator. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Below is a list of tentative questions to guide you. These are not definitive and you are encouraged to be creative and to follow the thread of conversation as it unfolds. With permission from your interviewees (parents/carers/friends/relatives), either record the conversation or take notes. Possible areas to explore: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parental expectations and/or aspirations in choosing school including information sought to make this choice</li>\n<li>What was the school’s spatial setting like – i.e., its location? What was its reputation?</li>\n<li>Recollections about contact with school authorities including parent-teacher interviews. What was positive? Challenging? How could this have been different? Is there a particular parent-interview that stands out? If they never attended why? What barriers (physical, financial, competing responsibilities, attitudinal etc) prevented them from doing so?</li>\n<li>Recollections of support within school for diversity: socioeconomic, cultural, racial/ethnic, linguistic, neurodiversity etc</li>\n<li>How were academic expectations navigated? How was homework perceived by carers and who took responsibility to offer homework support in primary school? In high school? If you came from a nuclear or extended family, which individual was more involved and why? How were decisions made between parents/carers on homework support? Were external sources of support accessed (eg grandparents, paid tutors, older siblings etc) and why?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Write up your findings in 1500 words exploring these or other topics as they relate to school choice, home-school partnerships including learning and general support. </strong></p>\n<p>At the conclusion of your paper, write a<strong> 300-word personal reflection</strong>. What have you learnt from this exercise about the capacity of (your) family to navigate schooling How might this inform your professional practice? </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
