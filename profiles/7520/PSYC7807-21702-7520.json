This length restrictions are important because in practice it is essential that interviews are written up in charts, files or reports in a concise, clear and professional manner. The length includes in-text citations. The reference list is not included in the page limit. You may chose to include a diagram of the formulation, if so this should be on a separate page and is not included in the page limit. Any diagram should not be used in place of a text description of the formulation.     </p>\n<p>The case study is to be typed (A4, double spacing, font 12 Arial or Times Romans or Calibri, 2.5cm margins, page numbers)</p>\n<p>Reference system: APA</p>\n<p>Over Length Case Studies: Written material beyond the designated page length will not be read.</p>\n<p>Contents of header and/or footer: Student Name, Student Number and PSYC7807</p>\n<p>Format of file for submission to Turnitin: Word or PDF</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong> DESCRIPTION OF TASK</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment piece is based on an encounter with a grieving person(s). To complete this report, you will need to interview one person who has experienced a significant loss during the previous two years or is dealing with a significant ongoing loss from before this time. The loss does not need to be a bereavement but should have been experienced by the person as a loss that meaningful to them. A minor loss is unlikely to provide the experience you need to successfully complete the assessment. This could be a client from one of your internships or someone you interview specifically for this assessment. You will be required to submit signed informed consent form (more details below) prior to submitting your assignment.     </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>If you are interviewing someone specifically for the purposes of this assessment piece, it is assumed that you would use your counselling skills to ensure that the interview is handled sensitively and ethically, but please remember that this is an interview to hear the story of the person’s loss, and NOT a therapy session. It is very important that the person you are interviewing is aware of this and comfortable that this is just an opportunity for them to tell their story to you. If the person was to become distressed and you believe more formal care is important, please reassure them that you will seek out support options for them and then contact your course coordinator as soon as possible to discuss this. During the interview with this person, you are aiming to come to an understanding of their loss experience using a relevant loss and grief framework. You may need to consider a variety of theories and empirical literature before coming to your decision about which framework is most relevant for understanding (formulating) the person’s experience. You may need to interview this person/people more than once if that is most appropriate for them.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You are then asked to prepare a professional style case report that includes sections as outlined below. Through the building of your case description and formulation you are asked to link the person’s experience to both empirical and theoretical literature (evidence-based practice). This assessment gives you a chance to methodically consider a case in a manner that you will need to do more rapidly in your everyday psychology practice.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Please see information on blackboard for more detailed information about the components of your report.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
