The poster should include the organisation's name, its establishment date, its number of employees, its history, its business model and how it has developed or sustained, and an assessment of what makes them innovative in their sector or market. The students are required to conduct and present the research regarding the ways in which the organisation has used and integrated design in its product, service, and strategy. This information should not be simply reproduced from online sources. The students are required to demonstrate understanding and comprehension by synthesising the information in a coherent, quick and accessible way.</p>\n<p>The outcomes of Assessment 1 will be presented in the week 3 studio, therefore the students are required bring a copy of their digital submission (on a flash-drive) and a printed A3 hard copy to the class presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment tasks prohibiting use of AI or MT: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

To assist with this, students will be introduced to key drivers of design innovation, across the lectures and studios in weeks 1-5 including methods for identifying organisational and personal strengths. Each team will present their manifesto and the teams design concepts. Each team member must contribute their own design concept for team consideration. The manifesto component should include: description of roles and responsibilities; a team formation plan; a team vision statement.</p>\n<p>The students should present your teams design concept, as well as the strengths of the team in relation to that product or service. This assessment consists of four parts: (a) team manifesto, (b) all individual design concepts presented (problem/solution definition), (c) reflections, and (d) group presentation. All parts are to be submitted in one consolidated group concept project book.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> each group assessment requires individual completion of a peer review exercise (via Blackboard) in which the students rate the performance of their team members. Completion of the peer review is mandatory. Students failing to complete the peer review will receive 0 marks for the assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
