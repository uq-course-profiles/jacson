The presentation should not simply summarise the paper, but should also be a critical evaluation of the ideas and encourage discussion from the class.</p>\n<p>Each seminar will be primarily led by the presenter, but all students are expected to engage in critical discussion of the target paper and surrounding literature during class discussions. Students will ideally have read the target papers for each talk as well as any accompanying material, or any other relevant readings discovered by the students, so that they can, for example, debate conclusions, support theory, raise questions, and generate hypotheses. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>When preparing your presentation, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The papers for this course have been chosen because they are interesting in one way or another – try to convey your excitement and interest to your audience.</li>\n<li>Focus on the study you have been given and what the authors have demonstrated about the particular problem you are discussing. Having said that, <em>you should </em><strong><em>read widely</em></strong><em>.</em> I encourage you to refer to other pieces of research and theories, but always bring your discussion back to the assigned paper(s) (more on this below).</li>\n<li>Read your allocated paper carefully. They will all include jargon that you will initially not understand. Remember that your audience won’t either. Part of the assignment requires you to go away and look up what these unfamiliar terms mean, and then (where relevant) be able to explain this to your audience.</li>\n<li>Provide an orienting statement with a real world example (ie an example demonstrating capacity limits in the real world is talking on a mobile phone while driving).</li>\n<li>When possible, provide a background to the area of research you are focussing on (what have previous papers shown, why is the current study being undertaken).</li>\n<li>Discuss the tasks that the experimenters have administered and the technique employed (e.g., method of constant stimuli, staircases). What were the results? Most importantly, what do they <em>mean</em>? How does it help to answer the question posed by the researchers?</li>\n<li>Always be aware of the level of evidence you are providing. For example is it causal or correlational. </li>\n<li>Remember to provide a conclusion that summarises what your paper has shown us about the topic. Feel free to be critical and to raise other questions that have not been answered by in the paper you have been given, and/or questions that should be answered in the future.</li>\n<li>The above three points give you an opportunity to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the research, and to show independent thought. Is this good quality research? Is it convincing?</li>\n<li>Do adequate preparation. Good presentations are not prepared the night before and you’ll need to be able to answer questions your audience might have. Do not be afraid of silence if you ask a question and no one answers. Give your classmates time.</li>\n<li>Rehearse your presentation. Make sure that your presentation makes sense in terms of structure and that there is no redundancy. Is it between 25-30 minutes long?</li>\n<li>Prepare your presentation using PowerPoint/Keynote/Some other platform. Try to incorporate visuals to illustrate your point. For example, you may want to show pictures of the types of tasks administered to the participants. Often images from the paper will be helpful.</li>\n<li>Do not read your presentation. By all means have notes or cards to assist, but remember that you have to try and engage your audience and that is hard to do when reading. You do not have to be word perfect!</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
