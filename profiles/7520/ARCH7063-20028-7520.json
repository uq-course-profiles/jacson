The word count could be less if the research outcomes are largely graphical or numerical, as agreed with the advisor. Apart from text, the Thesis may contain drawings, data, models, images, video and other media as agreed with the advisor. The Thesis may develop research previously conducted for other 2-unit Part D Research courses; however, the expectation is that prior work has been reconsidered and reframed in the thesis, not reproduced verbatim. The thesis should represent a substantial new body of work. No more than 20% of the text can be repeated from earlier submissions. The Thesis should contain a section headed “Prior research included in this Thesis” identifying any sections that draw on research conducted prior to enrolling in ARCH7060 and any prose sections that have been previously submitted for a previous course. The Thesis should be presented as a PDF document suitable to be printed at A4 either portrait or landscape format, or A3 landscape format. If the thesis includes video or 3D models embedded in the PDF, make sure to also include 2D still images of this material in case of future media incompatibility. Following the examination of the thesis, students will be required to make any recommended corrections or amendments to the satisfaction of the supervisor and course coordinator, and upload the corrected thesis to e-space.</p>\n<p><strong>Formative Feedback: </strong>You should be meeting and discussing drafts regularly with your advisor(s) during teaching weeks. Formal formative feedback points are scheduled in Week 10 of Semester 1 when a draft chapter should be submitted directly to your advisor for feedback. Students will present a 10-15 minute paper based on one aspect of their research and include a brief overview of how this fits into the thesis. Formative feedback will be given verbally following presentations.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment tasks prohibiting use of AI or MT: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
