Please choose the articles carefully from reputable peer-reviewed journals, as the credibility of your selected sources will be assessed. For each article, answer the following questions in your presentation:</p>\n<p><strong>1. What is the phenomenon under investigation and what research question(s) did the article attempt to answer?</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the phenomenon or topic the article investigated and state the research question(s) and, where relevant, any hypotheses that were tested.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What was the motivation for the study?</strong></p>\n<p>Describe the motivation for the research undertaken. If possible, specify how it relates to, refines and extends existing research. Describe the gap the articles aimed to fill. Be specific. Name and cite the previous studies where appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What methodology was used?</strong></p>\n<p>Identify the research methodology used to address the research question(s): Who were the participants? How was the data collected and analysed? How many participants were analysed? What corpus was used? What tools/techniques/methods/statistical procedures were used?</p>\n<p><strong>4. What were the findings?</strong></p>\n<p>Briefly state the results of the study. Were the research question(s) addressed? Were the hypotheses substantiated or falsified? What did the study find?</p>\n<p><strong>5. What were the limitations and implications of the study?</strong></p>\n<p>What were limitations or shortcomings of the study? Evaluate the study's value (contribution to the field) and shortcomings and were there any improvements suggested to mitigate those limitations?</p>\n<p><strong>Important Guidelines</strong></p>\n<p>Prepare slides for your presentation and record yourself and the slides (we suggest you use Zoom and share your screen as the recording cannot exceed 100MB).</p>\n<p>The presentation of each article should be no longer than 3 minutes. Your answers should be presented as a coherent summary of the articles.</p>\n<p>Bibliographic details for each article should be presented in APA 7 citation style when you start summarising and discussing the paper. Any citations mentioned in your presentation need to be added in a reference list at the end of your presentation (which should also be formatted according to APA7).</p>\n<p>After completing the summary and description of the two articles or studies, compare and critically evaluate the articles. This should also take about 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>Comment on differences and similarities across the articles. These common features might include the kind of research questions asked and the motivations used, the object of study, methodological approach, data, etc. Evaluate the methodologies and the presentation of results in the articles. Have the articles answered the research questions? Were the data and methods appropriate to answer the research questions? How were the results presented? Was one study better than the other and, if so, why and how?</p>\n<p>Your slides and your presentation should be engaging and informative. Your slides should not be too text heavy, and the slides should contain the main aspects of what you say/present. Use appropriate language without errors both on the slides and in your presentation. You are welcome to use visualisations and tables created by yourself and/or from the articles. Your face needs to be visible during the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement on Gen AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.
