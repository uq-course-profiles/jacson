These questions will form the basis of tutorial discussions.</p>\n<p>Each submission is worth <strong>2 </strong>marks, <strong>18 </strong>marks<strong> </strong>in total.</p>\n<p>To receive the weekly mark, you must:</p>\n<p>i) upload your answers to Turnitin by 5pm on the Wednesday before the weekly lecture and tutorial;</p>\n<p>ii) answer 2 of the 4 comprehension questions correct and make a genuine effort to answer the speculative questions;</p>\n<p>iii) attend the tutorial and participate meaningfully in discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>There will be no part marks, i.e. your mark each week will be either 2 or 0 (for your score will be treated as a proxy for the quality of your participation) </strong></p>\n<p>Missed tutorials due to illness will be counted if a doctor’s certificate is provided. If you are unable to attend due to technical issues or other unavoidable circumstances, e.g. your internet connection, you may a submit a 500-word summary of the weekly reading, along with answers to the questions. Please note that there will be a limit to the number of summaries that can be submitted in lieu of participation.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

This is not to say that you will need to cover every aspect of the text: both <em>Leviathan </em>and the <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, e.g.,<em> </em>are more than 500 pages long! Rather, the expectation is that your reading will be targeted and directed; and indeed, one of criteria according to which you will be assessed will be your ability to identify the key arguments. In this respect, the course reading will be a good place to start!</p>\n<p>This is a research essay, which means that you will be required <em>both </em>to engage directly with your chosen primary source to substantiate your claims and to consult appropriate secondary sources (i.e. chapters/articles/books about your sources) to help situate their arguments. Specifically, it is expected that no less than <strong>10% </strong>of your essay should be direct quotes from your primary source with page numbers included (approximately <strong>10 quotes</strong>). There is also the expectation that you engage no fewer than <strong>five </strong>secondary sources.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
