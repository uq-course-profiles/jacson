Each of these tasks is based around a worksheet, which you can download from the course's Blackboard site. During practicals students work in small groups and complete a worksheet (one worksheet per group) During the practical sessions, casual demonstrators will be available to assist you with using the experimental equipment and to help clarify the concepts you are learning.</p>\n<p>Laboratories 2, 3, 4, and 5 are paired with an Assignment Aligned to the Practical (AAP) which is completed and submitted in advance of doing the practical. Both the practical and its aligned assignment are  designed to reinforce and deepen your understanding of the course's learning objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>\n<p>Students who experience challenges with their laboratory team can access resources online <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/study-skills/group-work/resolving-group-work-issues\">here</a>. Teams unable to resolve their challenges should reach out to the immediate teaching team for assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria and Marking:</strong></p>\n<p>Assessment will be based on casual demonstrator observations of each group's participation in the practical and understanding of the concepts covered.</p>\n<p>Casual demonstrators will assign each group a mark of 0, 1, or 2 in each practical based on the following criteria:</p>\n<p>0 - The group did not actively participate in the practical and/or demonstrate sufficient understanding.</p>\n<p>1 - The group participated in the practical, completed most the work and demonstrated some (but not full) understanding of the concepts involved through answers to the worksheet questions, engaging effectively as a team to do so</p>\n<p>2 - The group participated in the practical, completed the work and demonstrated an understanding of the concepts involved through answers to the worksheet questions, engaging effectively as a team to do so.</p>\n<p>Casual demonstrators will progressively mark each group during the practical using the practical worksheet and provide feedback on responses. Completed worksheets will be archived by the responsible casual demonstrator, who will record marks obtained by each group against the group members' names. Each student is responsible for ensuring that their name is recorded on the group worksheet. Each student is encouraged to complete an individual copy of the worksheet during the practical for their own records.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
