For each weekly entry, students will write a minimum of 400 words consisting of two parts. The first part requires students to summarise the week's learning in their own words, using 200 words or more. In the second part, also 200 words or more, students will present their own thoughts and critical review of the week's topic and discussion. When writing their critical review, students should incorporate points raised during class discussion, respond to questions or issues that emerged in class, and expand on these with their own analysis and perspectives. This exercise encourages students to engage actively with course content through personal reflection and thoughtful consideration of class discussions. No references are required for this assessment.</p>\n<p>The assessment starts in Week 3 and ends in Week 13 (10 submissions in total; no reflection due in Week 8, because of Week 7 in-class, In-Semester Exam). Each submission is due on Friday in the following week's class; e.g. Reflection of Week 6 is due on Friday in Week 7 at 5 pm.</p>\n<p>Reflections will be marked based on the <strong>accuracy, relevance and originality of the summary and review</strong>. Any assignment found copied from sources on the internet or other students' work will receive 0 point and be referred to the School's Integrity Officer.</p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
