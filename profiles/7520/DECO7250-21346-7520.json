Across <strong>two phases</strong>, you will (1) conduct <strong>contextual inquiry</strong> (including user research, scenarios, and affinity diagramming) to identify user needs, and (2) develop a <strong>conceptual design</strong> (including a conceptual model, future scenarios, and a prototype) that addresses those needs. Throughout the process, each team will maintain a <strong>Work Record</strong> to document contributions and submit <strong>Individual Reflections</strong> to demonstrate collaboration and engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Full details of all tasks, required outputs, and grading criteria are provided in the <strong>Assessment Task Sheet </strong>that will be available in the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><strong>Submission Sequence</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment is divided into two key submission points to support your design process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Week 4 before the end of your allocated studio:</strong> You will submit <strong>Draft Research Instruments</strong> (e.g., interview questions, surveys) for early feedback. Incorporating this feedback will help you gather more reliable and relevant data for the next steps of your project.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 9 on or before 2pm on Monday 28 April, 2025:</strong> You will submit your complete<strong> Design Proposal</strong>, which includes all artifacts from both the Contextual Inquiry and Conceptual Design phases, along with the Team Work Record and your Individual Reflection.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This <strong>two-step approach</strong> ensures you receive formative input early on—enabling stronger user-centered research—and culminates in a fully developed proposal that demonstrates how your solution addresses real user needs.</p>\n<p><strong>A1.1 Draft Research Instruments (Pass/Fail)</strong></p>\n<p>This component is <strong>essential</strong> because it directly informs your user-centered design work for the <strong>A1.2 Design Proposal</strong>. You must submit <strong>draft</strong> interview/survey instruments in <strong>Week 4</strong> and achieve a <strong>Pass</strong> to proceed effectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One Chance to Resubmit</strong>: If you do not pass on the first submission, you will have an opportunity to revise your instruments based on feedback and resubmit.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing After Resubmission</strong>: If you still do not pass after this second attempt, the highest grade you can attain for <strong>A1.2 Design Proposal</strong> will be capped at a <strong>Pass (4)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Well-crafted research instruments are the <strong>foundation</strong> of your entire project. Ensuring they meet the minimum required standard guarantees that your subsequent design activities (scenarios, affinity diagram, user stories, etc.) are based on <strong>meaningful, accurate user data</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Use of Generative AI and Machine Translation Tools</h2>\n<p>This task has been designed to challenge students with authentic and complex problems, reflecting professional contexts in web design and development. The use of Generative AI (GenAI) and Machine Translation (MT) tools is permitted and encouraged, provided it aligns with the course's<strong> GenAI and MT Usage Framework (available in Blackboard / Course Resources) AND the boundaries for appropriate use as defined in the task sheet for this assessment item.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Successful completion of this assessment requires students to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Critically engage with these tools to enhance creativity, problem-solving, and technical proficiency.</li>\n<li>Reflect on their use of AI technologies, documenting how they supported the task and evaluating their effectiveness, limitations, and ethical implications.</li>\n<li>Ensure all outputs are critically reviewed, revised, and transparently acknowledged, maintaining academic integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students are expected to maintain ownership of their work by ensuring that the final submission reflects their understanding and skills.
