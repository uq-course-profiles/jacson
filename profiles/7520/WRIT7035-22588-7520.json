In this project, you will work remotely with a team to assess collaboration and communication tools and pitch a solution to management. Like any workplace collaboration, the project includes both individual and team writing, and you will be graded individually through a mix of self-, peer and instructor assessment.</p>\n<p>The project has four components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Annotated bibliography</strong> (10%, recommended deadline Monday week 11; team submission): you will assess 3-5 sources relating to remote collaboration and collaboration tools and write an annotated bibliography, which you will share with your team and submit as a group for assessment</li>\n<li><strong>Internal memo</strong> (10%, recommended deadline Monday week 13; individual submission): you will write a short email memo explaining which collaboration tool you recommend and why. You will share this with your team and submit it individually for assessment</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal</strong> (20%, deadline: 1st Monday of exam period; team submission): your team will write an internal proposal, based on your research and team memos, recommending a collaboration tool to management. Your team will submit this for assessment</li>\n<li><strong>Reflection</strong> (5%, deadline: 1st Monday of exam period; individual submission): you will write a reflection on your team's work throughout the project, including an assessment of your and your peers' contributions to the project</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

These deadlines have been selected to ensure your team makes consistent progress towards the final submission while practicing key team writing skills.</p>\n<p>Should your team need an extension on any of the interim components (annotated bibliography, individual memo), you should agree on a new deadline together, and then email me to advise me of the date. All team members must agree to the new date, and all team members must be cc'd on the email requesting an extension.</p>\n<p>Should your team need an extension on the final proposal, you should agree on a new deadline together, and then submit a formal extension request to the central administration team.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Over the course of the semester, we believe that everyone will get better at writing through engaging in conversation about writing with your peers, applying new information to complete writing tasks, and revising your work. This development will be visible in your submitted work in this and other classes. Regardless of whether you commence the class as a novice workplace writer or a confident workplace writer, you can still get better - but that development is not fully captured by assessing completed work.</p>\n<p>In your reflection, you will be asked to assess your progress against three of the course's Learning Outcomes. You should provide evidence of your skills and confidence when you started the class and when you finished it, and a warrant that connects your evidence (what you learnt in the class and how it shows up in your writing) to the claim you have made about your development in each area. Your evidence must include discussion of at least one in-class workshop activity, at least one of our scholarly readings, and at least one writing task you completed for this course. You can also include evidence from other writing contexts to supplement this course-specific information.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
