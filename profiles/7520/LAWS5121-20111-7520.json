The Fact Sheets will be assessed based on how well they convey accurate, easily-understood and useful guidance to individuals navigating the family law system and the legal memos will be assessed based on their the accuracy, clarity and persuasiveness in identifying and applying the relevant legal principles and case law to the specific facts. </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
