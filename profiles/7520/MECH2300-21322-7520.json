This platform integrates into Blackboard and enables the course to run assessed quizzes which draw from a large range of example structures and materials problems. The problems are randomizable to ensure all students work with a unique set of numbers to ensure individual work in support of academic integrity.</p>\n<p>Each week's quiz is designed to test concepts covered in that week's lecture and tutorial. If you attend that week's tutorial and understand the problems which it covers, then you should be well prepared to complete that week's quiz. You are strongly encouraged to attend the tutorials and clarify any questions about the tutorial problems during that session. Each week's quiz is timed to become available to students at the conclusion of the last tutorial for that week, and is then due 2 hours before the following week's tutorial. This ensures all students have the same amount of time to attempt the quiz, regardless of which tutorial they attend, and also ensures that tutorial time can focus on that week's tutorial problems. If you have questions about the quizzes you should raise these on Ed Discussion Board, which will ensure all students have access to the teaching staff's advice on this assessment item.</p>\n<p>The mark for this assessment is calculated as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The maximum mark for each week's quiz is 2% of the overall course grade, and there are 12 quizzes in total.</li>\n<li>To get the full 2% for each week's quiz, you will need to get at least 75% for the quiz (i.e. correctly answer 75% of the quiz problems).</li>\n<li>Each quiz mark will be computed as follows: weekly quiz grade = minimum(&lt;your quiz mark in %&gt;, 75%)/(75%)×2%</li>\n<li>The total mark for this assessment item is capped at 20% for the semester, with overall grade = min(20%, ∑&lt;your quiz grades across the 12 quizzes&gt;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are required to <strong>register with Pearson Mastering in Week 1 of Semester</strong> so that you are able to complete the assessed online quizzes. If you encounter technical problems doing so, as a first step you should refer to the provided support documents on Blackboard; as a second step, seek advice through the Ed Discussion Board; if you continue to have problems you should contact the Course Coordinator by email. <strong>If you leave the registration process until Week 2 and encounter technical problems which prevent submission of your quiz by the due date, these technical problems will not be accepted as grounds for an extension to the assessment.</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
