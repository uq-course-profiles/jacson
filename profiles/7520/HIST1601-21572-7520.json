This assessment aims to help students develop skills in analysing a primary source.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Begin by choosing your own primary source that relates to a topic in the course that interests you personally. The primary source should have been created within the timeframe of the course: c. 1200 CE to the present, and should not include any of the primary sources supplied as part of the tutorial program.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Some examples of famous primary sources are, 'The Secret History of the Mongols'; Emperor Qianlong’s 'Edict to King George III'; Japan’s 'Imperial Rescript on Education'; or Abraham Lincoln's 'Gettysburg Address'. In most cases the primary source will be a written document, but you might also analyse a suitable historical object, building, or work of art.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your essay can address the source as a whole, or, if the source is too lengthy, concentrate on an extract.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In your essay, critically discuss your primary source with reference to the following:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>(i) the author/s of the source;</p>\n<p>(ii) the key features of the source;</p>\n<p>(iii) the historical context in which the source was written or created;</p>\n<p>(iv) historiographical debate about the source;</p>\n<p>(v) how you think historians should interpret the source today.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The essay should be written and submitted as a formal essay, with scholarly referencing (footnotes and bibliography, using Chicago referencing style:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/chicago17-notes-bibliography\">https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/chicago17-notes-bibliography</a></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You should consult the relevant scholarly literature (academic books and articles relevant to the topics addressed in your selected primary source) to help you in your analysis. Start work for this essay in the UQ Library. Locate suitable sources through bibliographic searches, checking footnotes in books and articles, consulting anthologies, or searching online collections and databases. If in doubt consult your tutor. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new research tool. In HIST1601, students may use AI in the process of researching an assignment. <strong>However, submitted assessments must strictly be the written work of the student alone.</strong> Papers submitted to Turnitin will automatically be checked for the use of AI. Students must clearly reference any use of AI through an explanatory note in their bibliography.

Known for his lively style and provocative commentary on fellow historians, Cantor wrote for general audiences rather than historical specialists. REQUIRED READING: PRIMARY SOURCE Ibn Battutah, ‘The Pilgrimage to Mecca’, in The Travels of Ibn Battutah , Tim Mackintosh-Smith, ed. (London: Picador, 2002), pp. 43-57. While we may be more familiar with Marco Polo, the fourteenth-century Muslim scholar, Ibn Battuta (1304-1377?) was arguably more significant as a medieval traveller. His travels took him from Tangier in North Africa to the Arabian peninsula, Iran, India, Southeast Asia, and China. He left a famous description of his travels, The Rihla (“Travels”), which is one of the world's great travelogues, only fully translated into English in the 1990s. Ibn Battuta's travels demonstrate how interconnected the world already was in the fourteenth century as a result of integration forged by the Mongol Empire, and the role of Islam as a globalizing force in the medieval period.",

TUTORIAL: Revolutionary Ideas and Modern States Week 9 Tutorial: Revolutionary Ideas and Modern States TUTORIAL QUESTIONS: What key ideas in the American Declaration of Independence would you think of as ‘modern’? Considering these ideas in context, how and why did they spread, and to where? REQUIRED READING: SECONDARY SOURCE Linda Colley, ‘The Force of Print’ in her The Gun, the Ship and the Pen: Warfare, Constitutions and the Making of the Modern World (London: Profile, 2021), pp. 107-54. Linda Colley is a highly original British historian who became prominent in the 1990s with her book, Britons , that re-cast the origins of British national identity through an emphasis on empire, conflict, and Protestantism. Her later books have looked at ‘captivity narratives’ in the history of the British empire, and most recently the development of constitutionalism as a global mode of state-building since the 1750s. REQUIRED READING: PRIMARY SOURCE Congress of the United States, ‘Declaration of Independence’ 4 July 1776. Transcription and digitised version of the original document at the US National Archives: https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript The US Declaration of Independence has a significance far beyond its status as the founding statute of the United States of America. It is one of the foundational documents of what historians consider the ‘modern age’. It expresses a number of key Enlightenment ideas about ‘despotism’ and ‘liberty’ that were nothing short of revolutionary.

It looks at radical nationalist movements in Asia, the rise of fascism and communism in Europe and its culmination in the Second World War (1939-45). The war not only defeated fascism, but also brought to an end the era of European and Japanese imperialism. We consider the post-war founding of global institutions like the United Nations and the Bretton Woods agreements in the 1940s, and US and Western powers' attempts to establish a global 'liberal rules-based order.' We examine the ideological clashes between capitalism and communism during the Cold War, decolonization in the former colonial states in Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, rapid economic growth and its environmental impact, social movements for justice and change, and the emergence of the US as the sole global hegemon following the end of the Cold War in 1991.

            "topic_description": "PART C: THE GLOBAL MODERN, WEEK THIRTEEN:      LECTURE: Globalisation in our Time The lecture reflects on the remaking of the global order following the end of the First World War. It looks at radical nationalist movements in Asia, the rise of fascism and communism in Europe and its culmination in the Second World War (1939-45). The war not only defeated fascism, but also brought to an end the era of European and Japanese imperialism. We consider the post-war founding of global institutions like the United Nations and the Bretton Woods agreements in the 1940s, and US and Western powers' attempts to establish a global 'liberal rules-based order.' We examine the ideological clashes between capitalism and communism during the Cold War, decolonization in the former colonial states in Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, rapid economic growth and its environmental impact, social movements for justice and change, and the emergence of the US as the sole global hegemon following the end of the Cold War in 1991. We conclude the course with a consideration of the strength of globalising forces - and resistance to these forces - in recent years. PLEASE NOTE: No HIST1601 tutorials this week. Recommended Reading Peter Frankopan, The Silk Roads: A New History of the World (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), esp. the chapter, 'The New Silk Road', pp. 508-21. Peter Frankopan is professor of global history at Oxford University. Formerly a scholar of medieval Byzantium, he later expanded his horizons to explore themes of global connection in history. In the concluding chapter to this bestselling book Frankopan reflects on today's changing global order shaped by the rise of China and other rapidly developing countries, the shift from US global hegemony to a more multi-polar world, and the return of the world's economic centre of gravity to the Eurasian continent. Richard Drayton and David Motadel, \"Discussion: The Futures of Global History\", Journal of Global History, Vol. 13 (2018), pp. 1-21. Written shortly after Brexit (Britain's withdrawal from the European Union) and the rise of Donald Trump's 'America First' movement in the United States, Richard Drayton and David Motadel consider the future of the field of global history.",
