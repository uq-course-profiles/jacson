Some of these trauma therapies are extensions of existing theoretical approaches while others have been developed with trauma as the primary focus. All well-established trauma theories draw on many common foundations, but they also have differences in how their respective therapy is designed and applied. Your task is to present a group seminar on a specific trauma theory. You may choose from the following list of theories or select a different theory after approval from the course coordinator.</p>\n<p><em>Trauma Therapy Approaches</em></p>\n<p>·      Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)</p>\n<p>·      Somatic Experiencing</p>\n<p>·      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</p>\n<p>·      Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT)</p>\n<p>·      Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)</p>\n<p>·      Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR)</p>\n<p><em>Your Task in Detail</em></p>\n<p>In a group of three or four people your task is to present a 40-minute seminar overviewing the history and theoretical principles of the selected approach. In addition, you will need to select a case study from a list of case studies (see case study file) and explain how the trauma theory would be applied to the case. As part of your presentation, you will need to incorporate a class activity which will help ground the class’s understanding of the approach. The presentation should be divided into three sections:</p>\n<p>1.      a theoretical overview of the approach;</p>\n<p>2.      an application of the approach to the case study; and</p>\n<p>3.      a class activity.</p>\n<p>Each group will need to develop a PowerPoint presentation which will be shared with the whole class at the end of the semester.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
