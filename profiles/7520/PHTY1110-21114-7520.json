Finally, you will be asked to discuss what you can learn from the art to help you be a better physiotherapist. The assignment will require you to use the content you have learnt in the ‘culture and physiotherapy’ module of the course. It will assess your ability to critically reflect. It will also assess your ability to write about complex concepts and apply them to physiotherapy practice. </p>\n<p>A template for this assignment will be provided on Blackboard. The written summary is a maximum of 600 words.
