There is no final exam and these quizzes form the major theory and content-based assessment.</p>\n<p>\"Quizzes\" include quizzes, summations, writing assignments or critical thinking challenges based on the pre-class learning material and the previous and/or current week's lecture. The assessment is designed to assess understanding of assigned readings and the week's learning material, and to keep students on track for successfully incorporating biodiversity and systematics concepts. Quizzes are administered via Learn.UQ or via paper-copy during lectures. They are to be done in-person during class.</p>\n<p>There are 11 quizzes but only the best 8 scores will be included in your final mark. Each will be equally weighted and averaged for your final score. This means you can miss several quizzes wthout needing a medical certificate, but if you miss more you should contact the course coordinator.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
