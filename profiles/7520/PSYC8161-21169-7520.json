What is a ‘classic’ case you rightly ask? It is a case (n = 1) which has been well documented in the literature and that has served to clarify an important neuropsychological construct. The ‘classic’ case of H.M. would be an example. His case and the research it prompted served to further our understanding of the functions of the medial temporal lobe regions. Topics will be memory, language – spoken or written, arithmetic, action, executive function, visual perception, attention, social cognition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The classic cases will be assigned by Gail during Wk 1. It will be a case in the literature that you can give a comprehensive description of both the lesion to the brain and the cognitive assessment. You will describe with accuracy and specificity the implicated brain regions, the neuropsychological consequences of the injury (e.g. assessment results), how this particular case has contributed to our understanding of a specific neuropsychological construct, and you will critically evaluate the case study itself. In order to perform well on this task you will need to go beyond simply presenting the details of the case study- you will also need to demonstrate that you have thought critically about the case itself and how it has contributed to our neuropsychological understanding. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your case presentation will run for 20 minutes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p>\n<p>The presentation will be worth 50% of the overall grade for the course.
