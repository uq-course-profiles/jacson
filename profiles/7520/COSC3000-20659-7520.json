Projects will typically include a written report, and can include other material such as animations, interactive visualisations, video, etc. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full project (1-60 marks): For example, you can choose a complex dataset and explore and visually communicate the data therein (possibly using computer graphics techniques), create a computer graphics program such as a ray tracer, or use existing computer graphics tools to create a visualisation of your choice demonstrating your grasp of computer graphics. A full project should demonstrate a broad range of visualisation or graphics techniques, including advanced techniques. It should also demonstrate your understanding of these techniques.</li>\n<li>Mini project (1-40 marks): Similar to full project, but aims to demonstrate a narrower range of techniques.</li>\n<li>Micro project (1-20 marks): Student demonstrates their understanding of a topic in visualisation or graphics. This can be primarily a demonstration of a technique, a tutorial presenting a technique or topic, a literature review of a topic, or another suitable format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you submit a proposal describing your planned topic by the start of week 6. Your proposal should include:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What - what are the topic, scope, and goal of your project?</li>\n<li>Why - why is your project important and/or interesting?</li>\n<li>How - how will you go achieve the goal of your project?</li>\n<li>Details - enough detail to allow us to judge the feasibility and suitability of your proposed project. For example, what is your data source, what graphics techniques will you demonstrate, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Further details on projects, project scope, project topics, and marking will be available during the semester.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
