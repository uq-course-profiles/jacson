Some examples include a written submission (300 words +/- 50 words), an audio file (3-4 mins in length), an audio-visual (3-4 mins in length) or visual format. Please note that if you use a visual format, your submission should be accompanied by a 150 word exegesis. An exegesis is an explanation of your visual piece; this need not be written in a formal style, nor address the theme of question specifically. However, it does need to provide some context to your submission. </p>\n<p>All submissions, regardless of format, must include a reference list/bibliography in APA 7th (see this <a href=\"http://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">library link</a> for guidance). </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
