This simulation exercise will be undertaken in groups of three students with each exercise taking approximately one hour. A schedule for the simulation exercise will be released in Week 9. The outline of the case scenario for this exercise will be allocated in class in Week 10, when there will also be the opportunity for discussion or questions about the scenarios. The simulation and assessment of the groups will be conducted between 8am-5pm. The simulation will involve actors playing the role of clients and will be conducted as a sequence that involves the participation of everyone in the group with each student engaging with the \"clients\", for approximately 15 minutes, and then there will be a short time for debriefing from the exercise. Students must attend the entire 60-minute session and observe other students’ participation as necessary for the write up of a case note and process review analysis. The aim of this task is to demonstrate; process skills in engaging clients; critical thinking as indicated in the approach to questioning; formulating an integrated assessment; providing information, negotiating, and planning; and skills around assessing situations of risk and safety in social work practice in health and ageing setting. The demonstration will be recorded for marking and made available to students to review and complete the remaining assessment components. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: Part A of this assessment item (the simulated demonstration of skills activity) is not eligible for an extension request and students who do not participate in the simulation/demonstration at the allocated time will receive a mark of zero for this assessment.
