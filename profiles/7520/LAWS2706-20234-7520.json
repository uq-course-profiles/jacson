A pass will mean that 1.5 marks will be allocated per Seminar, to a <strong>maximum of 10 marks</strong>. The criterion for passing is whether, in the opinion of your tutor, you have made<strong> a reasonable and serious attempt to answer the Seminar Exercise</strong>. In so doing, students must attempt to: (1) identify the issues raided by the question(s); (2) identify the rules and/or principles relevant to answering the issues; (3) identify and relate to the issues the relevant facts and/or factual assumptions; and (4) raise and address and matters of relevant legal policy were necessary or desirable.</li>\n<li>While collaboration, i.e. oral discussion of the questions, is acceptable, it is expected that any notes submitted for marking will reflect independent thought and judgement. Copying notes from other students is <strong>not acceptable</strong> and may be treated as academic misconduct. If there is genuine collaboration resulting in similar notes, you are advised to indicate the name(s) of your collaborator(s).</li>\n<li>Note that the feedback for this piece of assessment will be the tutorial itself, ie. the one to which the preparation relates. The answers will not be returned with comments, and so students should take the opportunity to raise any questions during the Seminar.</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, a mark out of 10 will be given to each student if, in the overall judgement of the course coordinator, the criteria set out in the course profile have been satisfied.</li>\n<li><strong>Answers cannot be submitted after class, or by email, or by another student on your behalf. </strong>Students must attend the tutrorial with their answers and stay for the duration of the tutorial to receive any marks. A student will not obtain a mark for tutorial preparation if she or he does not attend the tutorial group in which she or he is enrolled.</li>\n<li>The maximum mark can be achieved by submitting seven times in the course of the semester. Students can be absent or not prepare <strong>three times </strong>and still gain the full marks for Seminar preparation. This is designed to accommodate emergencies and other reasons for non-preparation. If a student is unable to attend their enrolled tutorial (after <strong>three</strong> absences), for example due to illness or a medical condition, then that student may apply for an extension in accordance with the usual assessment extension process. (Should you miss more than three seminars and wish to apply for an extension, visit: <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension\">https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension</a>). Students should submit an application for an extension for tutorial preparation only after they have failed to prepare for a <strong>third</strong> time. If an extension is granted, then that student may submit the notes to the tutor for the tutorial in which he or she is enrolled, together with a copy of the extension approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Students should not email the Course Coordinator regarding special requests for non-preparation except in the exceptional case where the student is unable to attend tutorials over the entire semester</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After enrolments close, students will <strong>not</strong> be permitted to change their enrolment in a Seminar <strong>without the written permission of the Course Coordinator.</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
