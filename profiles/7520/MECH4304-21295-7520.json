You may be assigned to G01-2). Please use this group number when submitting your assessments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Practical #1, Solidification Microstructures</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>An introduction to the process of casting; including melting of metals and melt handling and aspects of safety and risk.</li>\n<li>To characterise the solidification behaviour of metallic alloys and gain experience in thermal analysis of the solidification process. This will include the relationship between the cooling curve and evolution of microstructure during solidification.</li>\n<li>To understand the role of changing composition on the microstructure of the cast metal and how the change in microstructure may influence mechanical properties.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Four different alloys will be analysed in this practical, all of which will come from the same binary alloy system (your casual demonstrator will inform you of which alloys are being used during your practical). Melting will be done in an electrical resistance furnace prior to sampling. This is done by placing alloy pieces into a boron nitride coated crucible, which is placed in the furnace. The furnace will be set to a temperature that provides sufficient superheat to ensure alloys are completely liquid prior to thermal analysis experiments.</p>\n<p>Each of the four alloys of will be sampled for thermal analysis of the solidification process. Samples will then be used for microstructural analysis and hardness measurements to explore the relationship between composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of cast alloys.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of each student to ensure that they have collected all data <em>during the practical itself</em>, including any digital files required.

An additional objective is to develop an understanding of how additive manufacturing/3D printing can be used for the fabrication of patterns for sand-casting.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>As discussed in the introductory lecture and tutorial (week 1), this practical experiment involves the design of a 3D printed pattern (using plastic material extrusion/FDM) for sand casting, followed by the analysis of the sand-casting made using this pattern.</p>\n<p>Assessment will be based on both the communication and intent of your design along with a consideration and discussion of how the casting geometry and process influences the design of both the part and the mould along with a discussion of a selected casting defect (this does not have to be a defect that was observed in your casting).</p>\n<p><strong>Permitted use of Generative AI and MT for this assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
