A final list of groups will be posted on the course Blackboard. Students work in the same groups for both report and presentation parts. Your Consultancy Team (your group) has been commissioned by Brisbane City Council to develop a strategic document titled ‘Brisbane Resilience Strategy’. Your team was selected to undertake this work based on its global reputation in citymaking, metropolitan strategy and sustainable development. Brisbane City Council intends to use this work to inform and engage with the community about the resilience issues facing Brisbane; seek the cooperation of, and funding from other levels of government for key resilience projects; and engage with and support the private sector to build an understanding of, and ability to, transition to resilience practices. A nominated team leader from each group will submit a Group Report (4000 words ±%10 - excluding tables, figures, diagrams, images, references, appendices, endnotes and footnotes) – one copy per group.</p>\n<p>Group Presentation 1, you will present key findings from your review of the literature on resilient planning and your analysis of Brisbane’s challenges and opportunities. You will provide a strong argument for your proposed vision for a resilient Brisbane. This is a valuable opportunity to receive feedback on your progress before the final submission of your report.</p>\n<p>Group Presentation 2 serves as an opportunity for each team to showcase and elaborate on their strategies for developing a resilient Brisbane, building upon the content submitted in the previously completed group report. The objective is to communicate, defend, and engage with the proposed strategies, fostering a deeper understanding of resilience in urban planning.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
