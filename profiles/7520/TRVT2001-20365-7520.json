(approximately 900 words) </p>\n<p><strong>3.0 Recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the previous analysis, what are the key issues that the organisation should address? In other words, what should be the organisation's main concerns or strategic priorities? Recommend marketing research that is relevant and should be conducted to inform future marketing strategies. The recommendations may be multifaceted, such as using a combination of methods.
