Each student selects and nominates to the course-coordinator the set question for the essay that he or she wants to research by the end of week 1. He or she submits the completed essay of 2000 words by 7 June 2024. In this essay you should select and discuss ancient evidence which helps you to answer your chosen question and engage with pieces of modern scholarship that this course summary recommends and other pieces that you discover yourself in the course of your independent research. You are encouraged to consult the instructions for writing essays in Ancient History in the Classics and Ancient History Study Guide.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>With a few exceptions, every student is required to give an oral presentation of 5 minutes during the seminar in which the set question that he or she has selected for the research essay is being discussed. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition in these presentations, students who have nominated the same set question need to work out among themselves how each of their talks will cover different aspects of the seminar-topic. In order to make it possible for almost all to speak at each seminar, there is a cap of how many students can do each research essay. For each seminar, this cap is the total number of enrolled students in ANCH3540 divided by 8.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In each seminar there needs to be a chairperson to chair all the presentations. Each seminar group also selects 1 member who is responsible for the 1-page agenda that details where and when the seminar is taking place as well as the name of each speaker and his or her subject.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The chairperson and the agenda-writer are also responsible for setting up the Zoom-based and/or in-person meetings of the seminar group. While these 2 students are not <em>required</em> to give their own presentations, they are certainly able to present, if they would like to do so.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>By week 1, each student sends me by email his or her first, second and third preferences for his or her seminar/essay. Once the list for each seminar is complete, I will send it to each seminar/essay group as a whole. It will be up to you as a group to appoint roles and to turn up to your planning meetings.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
