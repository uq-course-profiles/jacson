Students will be provided ahead of time with a set of Turning Point Questions (TPQ) that are to be discussed, responded to, and then submitted at the end of each tutorial (one submission per group). While tutorial activities will be submitted at the end of every tutorial, only three (3) tutorial activities will be marked. Students will select which activity submissions will be marked according to the following schedule:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Activity submission clusters Choose one (1) from each of the following clusters to be marked</p>\n<p><strong>Cluster 1</strong></p>\n<p>Week 1</p>\n<p>Week 2</p>\n<p>Week 3</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Cluster 2</strong></p>\n<p>Week 4</p>\n<p>Week 5</p>\n<p>Week 6</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Cluster 3</strong></p>\n<p>Week 7</p>\n<p>Week 8</p>\n<p>Week 9</p>\n<p>Week 11</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>(For example after weeks 1, 2, and 3, your group will indicate via Learn.UQ which of the first three submissions will be marked. This is to be completed by Friday 2 pm of weeks 3, 6 &amp; 11.)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>TPQ submission #1 (weeks 1-3) and #2 (weeks 4-6) are worth 5%, while TPQ submission #3 (weeks 7-11) is worth 10%. These three submissions add up to a total of 20% for this assessment item. Submissions are due at the scheduled end of your tutorial. Time is provided in each tutorial to complete this activity and course staff can be called over or will 'drop in' to each tutorial group to elicit student understanding of course concepts. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>All members of tutorial small groups will receive the group mark for the weekly Turning Point Questions and then, at the end of semester, all students will complete a peer assessment through Buddycheck and individual marks will be adjusted accordingly. (Students are unable to gain more than the total group mark or less than the pass mark if the original mark was a pass.)</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
