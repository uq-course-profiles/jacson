It focuses on addressing a leadership challenge within the context of the group literature review project and setting personal leadership development goals. This assessment integrates the first three steps of the experiential learning cycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reflection on the Situation:</strong> Identify and analyze a leadership challenge. This is often something that you have struggled with in the past in group settings —for example, fostering collaboration, managing conflict, or ensuring equitable participation.</li>\n<li><strong>Generalisation:</strong> Use leadership theories to formulate your leadership goals and objectives.</li>\n<li><strong>Planned Action:</strong> Design a practical plan for demonstrating leadership in the group project and achieving your personal leadership goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Learning Project Plan should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reflection on the importance of leadership in your professional or personal context, particularly in group settings.</li>\n<li>Examples of leadership aspects you find enjoyable, challenging, or intimidating, especially in collaborative environments.</li>\n<li>A description of the leadership challenge you anticipate.</li>\n<li>Leadership concepts and skills you aim to develop and apply.</li>\n<li>Planned actions and strategies for demonstrating leadership, ensuring the focus is on leadership (not management or administration).</li>\n<li>3–5 SMART personal learning goals, focusing on the leadership skills or qualities you want to develop during your learning project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This integrated approach helps you align the general topic of leadership with your personal interests and ensures your development goals are clear, actionable, and relevant to the your context.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Limit:</strong> 1,000 words (excluding references).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
