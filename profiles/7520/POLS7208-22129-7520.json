While there are many reasons to question whether the world is indeed already multipolar or will ever truly become so, today’s world is – in more than one sense – shaped by “multipolarization.”</em> (<a href=\"https://securityconference.org/assets/02_Dokumente/01_Publikationen/2025/MSR_2025/Multipolarization_%E2%80%93_Munich_Security_Report_2025.pdf\">Munich Security Report 2025</a> , p. 13) Critically reflect on the previous statement in reference to the Asia-Pacific region. [Refer to primary source materials and debates in the academic IR literature to support your arguments.]</p>\n<p>2. The 'Hubs and Spokes' alliance system (AKA 'San Fransisco alliance system') has formed the cornerstone of US foreign policy towards the Asia-Pacific in the post 1945 period. Outline the policy directions of Trump 2.0 taking into account the most up to date policy announcements and decisions (based on primary/secondary sources). What impact do you think his presidency will have on the Hubs and Spokes model?</p>\n<p>3.  What are the main objectives of Chinese foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific since Xi Jinping came to power in 2013? Outline 2-3 key policies and explain how they have been implemented in the Asia-Pacific region. [Refer to primary source materials and debates in the academic IR literature to support your arguments.]</p>\n<p>4.  Despite Japan's alliance with the US, there is growing debate about the changing nature of Japanese security and defence needs in the context of Northeast Asian international relations. Critically evaluate the likelihood of Japan changing its Constitution (Article 9 Peace Clause) to allow it to take a <em>more active </em>role its own defence. That is, will Japan fully 'normalise' its defence and security policies in the future?</p>\n<p>5. Globalisation and cross-border interaction between goods and people has flourished in Southeast Asia in the last decade, increasing the saliency of regional cooperation between ASEAN states. Discuss <strong>one</strong> (1) non-traditional security issue that you think impacts on Southeast Asian states and evaluate how effective ASEAN and individual states have been in combatting (possible topics include trafficking in persons, migrant smuggling, transnational organised crime, piracy, health and pandemic disease, climate change and environmental degradation, pollution and haze, etc).</p>\n<p>6.Towards a 'South China Sea commons'. Drawing upon conceptual debates on regionalism, governance and the utility of institutions in the IR literature on the Asia-Pacific, do you believe 'a Sea of Peace' is possible? </p>\n<p>7.Critically evaluate the effectiveness of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and its role promoting regional security and dialogue for Pacific states. Drawing on the literature in IR on governance and regional institutions, what challenges does the PIF face in the evolving geo-strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific.</p>\n<p>8.What does the concept of 'middle powers' add to our understanding of the Indo-Pacific security landscape? Do you agree with Abbondanza (2023) that middle powers Australia, South Korea and Indonesia '<em>seem unlikely to provide an alternative platform for the region's direction in the near future, due to a number of internal divisions'</em>?</p>\n<p>9.Discuss the following statement: CVID (Complete, Verifiable, Irreversible, Denuclearisation) is no longer a realistic policy approach to promote greater peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsular [Refer to primary source materials and debates in the academic literature in IR and South Korean/North Korean studies to support your arguments.]</p>\n<p>10.Evaluate the attempts by Japanese and South Korean governments, to reconcile and resolve the issue of South Korean 'comfort women' who were kidnapped and used as 'sex slaves' during World War 2.
