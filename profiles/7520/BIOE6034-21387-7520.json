Once chosen, within the allotted timeslots in the course profile, perform a search of the literature and choose a minimum of ten (10) keystone papers (not Review papers) that present alternative approaches to achieving the goal of producing a tissue-engineered medical product you choose. This product and its format are entirely your choice. For example, it may vary from being an inductive scaffold for generating new tissue from stem cells, to being a platform creating mini-tissues for drug screening and stratification. In your own time and also within the allotted time slots, review these papers (and other papers, including up to three review papers) in detail (along with other associated works or cited references within them), using them to inform the conception, design and validation of your product.</p>\n<p>Write a detailed project proposal (maximum 10 pages of text (12 point font, Times New Roman, single line spacing), inclusive of up to 5 figures (with captions) within this text (see example provided by the course coordinator of the suggested formatting). The aim of this proposal is to convince a funding organisation (Cooper-White-Cool Philanthropies) to fund your project. The timeframe of your project is 3 years.</p>\n<p>The report is to be comprised of three sections, detailing 1.) 'Problem Statement and Aims' - the unmet need for such a product (the motivation) and the aims and objectives of the research project; 2.) 'Background'- a brief, concise review and critique of the research work performed to date (akin to a detailed literature review, a ‘state-of-the-art’ picture), and 3.) your 'Proposed Solution', inclusive of proposed experiments associated with achieving each aim and associated objectives, a statement of significance and innovation, a proposed timeline, budget table and budget justification.</p>\n<p>The first section (‘Problem Statement and Aims’) is the problem statement. It must briefly summarise the need for such a tissue-engineered solution, including the associated aetiology of the disease (if applicable) or injury, biology, physiology, and existing surgical and commercial options. Here, you will also clearly state your aims and the objectives associated with each aim.</p>\n<p>The second section (‘Background’) is a literature review. In this literature review, make sure to cite each of your chosen papers, including reference to the methods (experimental) used to fabricate and characterise the surfaces/scaffolds/devices/cells/tissue generated, highlighting the achievements of the research and also, if applicable, the failings. Further, make sure to critically analyse each of the works by comparing and contrasting the approaches taken by each group of researchers (responsible for the published works), highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the approach taken, and highlight any discrepancies in each of the papers, including any missing data or additional data that would have been useful or required to provide a more convincing argument or to substantiate their overriding hypotheses. Comment on the overall impact of the work, substantiating your statements with citation data and other related works. Ensure to make it clear to the funding body where the ‘holes’ in our understanding remain and the need for better solutions!</p>\n<p>The final section describes your 'Proposed solution'. Using the content of the literature review as your 'state-of-the-art' position, you must propose the pathway forward for the development of a tissue engineered product for your chosen application, which outlines in detail your proposed methodology/ies to achieve a clinically translatable tissue engineered medical product, including the methods (experimental) used to fabricate and characterise the surfaces/scaffolds/devices/cells/tissue generated, and to validate the utility of the product in terms of cellular responses and tissue generated. Make sure to clearly justify why such choices were made, and highlighting any foreseen challenges or hurdles. Each proposed experiment will sit under a specific aim and objective, and expected outcomes should be clearly stated. Provide a single paragraph stating what the 'significance and innovation' of this project and the expected outcomes are, and what impacts it will have (if successful!) on the field of tissue engineering (in terms of new insights, understanding, knowledge) and also on the Australian healthcare system and society. Include either within the text or as a table, a timeline for each Aim and objective. You will need to provide a shortened budget table of proposed expenditure per year, including a written justification for each line item within your budget table. Lastly, you will be required to submit your reference list as a separate file, in a format that will be described during the consults.</p>\n<h4>C&amp;T Engineering Innovation Project Pitch, Week 13, 27 May 12:00-14:00 or 28 May 8:00-10:00, Weight 10%</h4>\n<p>Presentations are split over two days in the normal tutorial/consult slots and students will be allocated a particular time.
