            "topic_description": "Lab 1: How to identify biodiversity In order to recognise and find ways to solve the biodiversity crisis you need some essential skills in identifying and describing biodiversity. You will develop these skills throughout the semester in BIOL1030 prac classes. In this week's laboratory class you will meet your fellow labmates and tutor, and apply the first step in the scientific process (observing) to create an identification key for local plants. We will look at the importance of a repeatable method for classifying biodiversity and how to communicate precise details clearly. You will work with this same tutor and group of students throughout the semester.",
