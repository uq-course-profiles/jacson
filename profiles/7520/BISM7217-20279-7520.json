The primary objective is to gain practical experience in the sequential processes of conceptualizing, constructing, evaluating, refining, and ultimately presenting an ML model. The assignment is designed to enhance your proficiency in utilizing Jupyter Notebook as the exclusive platform for model development.</p>\n<p>Throughout this project, you will delve into the intricacies of data pre-processing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to craft robust and effective ML models. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the iterative nature of model refinement, as you work to enhance the model's performance based on evaluation metrics.</p>\n<p>The deliverable for this assignment is the Jupyter Notebook containing your entire workflow. This serves as a testament to your skills in model development and showcases your understanding of the practical applications of ML in a business context. This assignment aims to equip you with practical insights and skills that can be directly applied in real-world scenarios, fostering a holistic understanding of the ML project lifecycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Progress Checks:</strong> To receive full marks in the assignment, you are required to successfully complete two progress checks during your enrolled tutorial sessions. There is no alternative for the progress checks.</p>\n<p>If you successfully complete the progress checks, you can earn full marks for the assignment. However, if you miss one or both progress checks, you will lose the opportunity to earn full marks.</p>\n<p>For example, to earn full marks for the data exploration part of the assignment, your work must be deemed \"very good,\" and you must have completed Progress Check 1. If your data exploration work meets the \"very good\" criteria but you have not completed Progress Check 1, you will only receive 90% of the total marks allocated for data exploration. Conversely, if you have completed Progress Check 1, you will receive 100% of the allocated marks.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
