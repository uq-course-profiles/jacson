To encourage such engagement 40% of your grade will be based on course engagement. This consists of two components.</p>\n<p>The first is tutorial participation, which is worth 10 of your 40 course engagement marks. Participation is not about making smart comments, or getting answers to questions right. It is about airing ideas, asking questions yourself, and contributing to a productive classroom discussion. Your tutor will keep a record of who participates in the tutorial discussions, and even if you make only one comment in a class, you will be marked as having participated. In other words, if you saying something in every tutorial, you will get 10 out of 10 for your overall tutorial participation. </p>\n<p>The second component consists of 10 weekly quizzes, conducted in person. Together, these are worth 30 of your 40 course engagement marks. The quizzes test your knowledge of the weekly required readings. Quizzes start in the second week of semester. You will have 5 minutes at the start of class to do each quiz. Each test is worth three marks, totally 30 marks. </p>\n<p>*** Note: Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

There is, however, considerable debate about what civilisations are, and about their claimed impact on world politics. Furthermore, claims to civilisational identity have gone in and out of fashion: from the late nineteenth century until to the 1960s, civilisational hierarchy justified the imperial organisation of the globe.
