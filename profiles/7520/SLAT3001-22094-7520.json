Alternatively, students may choose to pose a discussion question or comment on concepts from the reading/video resources and connect them either to their lived experiences or relevant scholarship. Specifically, questions should go beyond definitions, simple statements of research findings, or unsupported personal opinions. Questions should suggest plausible links / relationships between concepts, theories, findings, and their interpretations. Focus each question on one issue, then illustrate by examples, when possible.</p>\n<p>These questions/comments must be posted on Blackboard in the Discussion Board under the forum thread corresponding to the assigned week. </p>\n<p>See more detailed instructions in the relevant Assessment folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Gen AI &amp; MT Statement:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies for preparation, successful completion of this assessment will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
