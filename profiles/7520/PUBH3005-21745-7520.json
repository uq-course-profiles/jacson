To support this process you are required to locate and appraise an existing strategy, which could be adapted for the current program. Within a recorded video presentation, you will outline the purpose of the strategy, explain the theoretical model underpinning the strategy and the way this is applied. You will then appraise the outcomes of the strategy and make a recommendation on whether the strategy is appropriate for the purpose.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Specific instructions for this assessment task are available in the Blackboard course site under 'Assessment'.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You are required to develop a plan that will inform how the needs assessment is conducted. An important initial step is to review and summarise what is already known about the target population and health behaviour being addressed, including factors that may impact behaviour change. Secondly, you will outline the types of information that need to be collected for the needs assessment, in light of what is already known on the topic. You should identify 3 key categories of information that need to be collected, alongside an explanation of why the information is important and how it will be used. You will then need to identify a) stakeholders who should be involved in the needs assessment, with a rationale for why they should be involved, and b) two additional data sources, with an explanation of how each data source will contribute to the needs assessment. Finally, provide a short concluding section describing how the knowledge and methods outlined will support an effective needs assessment.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Specific instructions for this assignment are available in the Blackboard course site under 'Assessment'.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
