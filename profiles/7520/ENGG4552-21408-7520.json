The aim of the PDR is to receive feedback on your proposal. Usually the review panel consists of project stake-holders, chief engineers, subject matter experts, and other senior technical and program management staff and their job is to use their wisdom to identify weaknesses in your proposal and to provide constructive feedback. This way you can modify and improve your proposal at this early stage and ensure your prototype has a higher probability of being a success. </p>\n<p>You will receive marks as per the rubric below. In addition, you need to meet the requirements for a pass as outlined in the second rubric.</p>\n<p><strong>Teams must pass the PDR to complete the course.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Teams receiving a <em>fail</em> or <em>provisional pass</em> will need to complete and pass a second PDR scheduled for week 1 of semester 2. </strong></p>\n<p>Each PDR will be 30 min duration, with the initial 15 minutes allocated for your group's presentation, and the remaining time allocated for questions/discussion with the review panel. The presentation needs to be short but detailed, and keep to the 15min time allocation. The format is flexible, but you should include the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of the project and goals:</strong> <em>Explain what your project is about. Make this crystal clear to the panel, on the assumption that they are technically minded but completely unfamiliar with your project. Give enough background so that the project makes sense. And clearly explain the goals. Remember, if you proceed past this point of your presentation, but your audience haven’t yet figured out the essence of your project, they won’t be able to follow the rest of the presentation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Discussion of functional requirements and how these have been developed:<em> </em></strong><em>Give a very clear picture of: </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>What does your design need to \"do\" (i.e. its functions)?</em></li>\n<li><em>How will functionality be assessed (i.e. specifications)?</em></li>\n<li><em>What are your design objectives? I.e. What will make the design a \"good\" one? What are the most important objectives?</em></li>\n<li><em>What are the constraints? (money, time, interfacing systems, etc)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You don’t have much time to do this, and you’ll have people on the panel unfamiliar with your project. This is not easy, but, if you can’t explain functional requirements simply, then you need to…. still figure out how to explain them simply.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Summary of prior art and explanation about why/how your proposal is different/better:</strong> <em>Explain where your project fits into the current scheme of things. What aspects of your problem are unique/new? Something must be new/unique, or else the client could just order a solution from an existing supplier. What aspects of your design have already been well addressed with existing design solutions around the world? If you aren’t going with existing solutions, even where they might seem like they fit, then explain why. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Overview and description of the design solution your team has selected:</strong> <em>What solution are you planning to take? Can you explain the basic concept and justify it? This should be consistent with the outcomes of the prior art review, and also justified against the functional requirements and preliminary analysis.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Results of calculations/preliminary experiments that de-risk your aims: </strong><em>Show relevant preliminary analysis/experiments/results that provide confidence in your current design concept/strategy etc. For example, if you are taking an ambitious/original path to a solution, you need to show evidence that it should work. If some of these calculations or validation experiments are not yet ready, can you outline plans to obtain this de-risking data early enough to be useful? For this part, evidence should include one or more of the following:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3D printed model of your design solution (or major critical sub-systems);</li>\n<li>Preliminary 3D CAD model showing the concept;</li>\n<li>Prototype simulations/models that show how your concept performs;</li>\n<li>Prototype software that shows how you will provide functionality;</li>\n<li>Other approaches that may befit your project. Talk to course staff for advise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here we want to see how you are approaching the problems; to see that your approaches are fit for purpose; and we want to give you feedback on how you can improve. </p>\n<p><strong>Summary of critical risks and your corresponding mitigation strategies: </strong><em>Here you identify the show-stopping risks and how you will prevent these risks seriously compromising your project goals. Mitigation strategies should clearly and convincingly address the risks.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Your project plan (make sure this is legible when being presented, or bring hand-outs). This should include resourcing requirements and, if applicable, cash requirements: </strong><em>Show that you have a feasible plan to achieve your project goals. Show that you have disseminated all of the project activities into clear tasks, to a sufficient level of detail to enable meaningful scheduling of the tasks. Make sure all project activities, and all required resources, are included. And show how the workload will be distributed between the team members. Convince the panel that they can be confident your project will succeed.</em></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

The purpose of this document is to capture the design process, justification for key design decisions, calculations, drawings, test results, and project outcomes. The last section should also identify any areas for improvement in the work and how these should be addressed in the future. Effectively, this report should provide the reader (a competent engineer) with a blueprint of how to repeat your project and maybe how to improve upon it. To achieve this, the report should concisely capture the critical steps in your project and also material that is required to re-create the work (drawings, simulation files, etc...). The materials included in and with the report must be organised in a systematic and accessible way.</p>\n<p>As part of your documentation you should consider including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction &amp; scope</li>\n<li>System analysis &amp; requirements synthesis</li>\n<li>Design analysis (e.g. calculations/simulations)</li>\n<li>Drawing register and pdf drawings (e-copies of models and drawings to be submitted electronically)</li>\n<li>Key simulation results (submit simulation set-up files and results electronically)</li>\n<li>Verification/validation results </li>\n<li>Conclusions and recommendations for future work</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Format of submission</strong></p>\n<p>For the general format, please follow the general final year thesis submission guidelines, see the School website on \"Undergraduate Engineering Theses Submissions\". The link is currently - <a href=\"http://www.mechmining.uq.edu.au/mech-mining-thesis-submission\">http://www.mechmining.uq.edu.au/mech-mining-thesis-submission</a>. Please note, you do not require a signed letter in the front matter of your ENGG4552 final report.</p>\n<p>Aim for your report body length (excluding front matter and appendices) to be in the range 50-100 pages. Reports shorter than this length generally indicate insufficent scope or ambition.</p>\n<p>Groups are required to submit the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An electronic version of the report to be submitted via Turnitin on the course Blackboard site.</li>\n<li>If applicable, relevant code/calculations/set-up/electronic files are to be provided by emailing the course coordinator a cloud-storage link to the electronic files---by the due date/time---and to ensure it is available for at least four weeks from this date.</li>\n<li>Students will be required to complete peer evaluation for this assessment task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students may be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Blackboard for a detailed marking criteria.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
