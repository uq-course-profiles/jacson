The report will be accompanied by a brief in-class presentation in Week 5. Presentations will be structured around the case study buildings selected by students, and will allow the class to understand how individual research projects address different aspects of the same building. The report should primarily rely on drawings, tables, graphs and flow charts to communicate, rather than written text. Written text should be primarily used to explain and support what is shown in the drawings, tables and graphs and any elements which cannot be explained graphically, such as environmental performance targets. </p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and MT to support learning:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
