The argument is that if empirical research has supported the efficacy of a treatment, it must be effective. This position is flawed as empirical research typically demonstrates reliable clinical change only for a percentage of participants. So, in essence, no treatment works for everyone to the same degree.</p>\n<p>You should choose a diagnostic disorder from the DSM-V (NOT \"Depression\"). You are asked to examine the research evidence to assist in deciding about appropriate treatment for this disorder. You should compare two different psychotherapy based treatment approaches for your chosen diagnostic disorder. Art Therapy students should include one Art Therapy based treatment, alongside another psychotherapy approach. You can choose any two different approaches as long as they have been subject to empirical investigation and the differences between them can be clearly articulated. Compare the published studies for each of your chosen approaches for your chosen disorder. It is suggested that 4 studies per approach is reasonable.</p>\n<p>Develop a critical discussion around which approach may be most effective and why. Your critical discussion should include an assessment of common factors to describe the mechanisms of change or explain equivocal effectiveness.</p>\n<p>What can be concluded about best EBP with your chosen disorder based on your review?</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Student identifies an appropriate DSM-V disorder and identifies two appropriate treatment approaches that have been subject to empirical investigation and the differences between them can be clearly articulated.</p>\n<p>2.
