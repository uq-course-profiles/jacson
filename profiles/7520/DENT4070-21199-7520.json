There is no resubmission or resit option available for this assessment.</p>\n<p>The practical clinical portfolio will be reviewed and performance in each domain considered and used to complete a report of overall performance in each domain. Assessment of the portfolio will occur at two time points during semester, mid-semester and at the end of the semester, and the assessment will be done by the clinical teaching team including the course coordinator. This is based on student's performance and the quality of the weekly critical self-reflections following each session/day, during the assessment period from the interim time point to the submission of this assessment task. Additionally, the effort made by the student to take on board the mid-semester review feedback will be considered while this report is being finalised.</p>\n<p><strong>Four domains </strong>will be assessed to <strong>an expectations met (satisfactory), developing or not met standard (unsatisfactory) </strong>and mapped to the Professional competency requirements for the accreditation body for this program - The Australian Dental Council (Professional Competencies of the newly Qualified Dentist)</p>\n<p>The domains being assessed are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professionalism, Communication and Health Promotion</li>\n<li>Scientific knowledge and Clinical Information Gathering</li>\n<li>Critical Thinking, Diagnosis and Management Planning</li>\n<li>Clinical Treatment and Evaluation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students must achieve a pass on the FINAL end of semester portfolio review.</p>\n<p>This is a SUMMATIVE <strong>MUST PASS assessment </strong>on clinical performance progress at this stage.</p>\n<p>To achieve a pass, the criteria are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All domains are weighted equally, and <strong>student must achieve a pass in each domain, and an overall pass.</strong></li>\n<li>A pass in each domain will involve a student receiving 2 or less \"expectations not met\" (ENM) mark in Domain 1, and 1 or less \"expectation not met\" (ENM) in Domains 2-4.</li>\n<li>An overall pass for the report will involve a student receiving 4 or less \"expectations not met\" (ENM) mark across the 4 domains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is an opportunity for feedback and improvement when the mid-semester portfolio review is provided to students, and students must reflect on this feedback provided to improve their clinical performance in the latter part of the semester and use it to improve in areas identified as lacking or borderline. Both comments and grades must be considered while reflecting.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Submission Guidelines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Interim assessment: Mid-semester portfolio will be submitted and reviewed mid-way through the semester<strong> (Week 9)</strong> and feedback provided. This is a formative assessment.</li>\n<li>Final assessment: End-semester portfolio will be submitted and reviewed by the Course Coordinator at the end of the final week of the semester<strong> (Week 18)</strong>.
