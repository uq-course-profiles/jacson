Students enrolled <strong>externally</strong>, please refer to the course profile for External students for in-person examination arrangements.  </p>\n<p>The final exam is <strong>2 hours in duration with 10-minute perusal time</strong> during which you can make notes on draft paper. Students are not permitted to leave an examination until 60 minutes into the examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Structure of exam</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the exam is to examine what you understand about the application of theory to the MRI experiment. The exam is <strong>closed book</strong> and consists of 3-6 questions divided into sections.</p>\n<p>At the top of the booklet there is space for the following information, which you must fill out for every question you answer:</p>\n<p>Question No. ________ Section No. ____________ Student No. ____________________</p>\n<p>You should attempt all parts of the questions. You will not be expected to derive any mathematical equations.</p>\n<p><strong>Materials in exam</strong></p>\n<p>The only materials you are permitted to take into the exam is a <strong>Casio FX82 series or other UQ approved calculator as per UQ policy</strong>. You can read more about the UQ policy on use of calculators in examinations in https://my.uq.edu.au/services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/sitting-exam/calculators-in-exams</p>\n<p><strong>Exam technique</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do’s  </strong></p>\n<p>Read the instructions and questions carefully.</p>\n<p>Understand and analyse the question.</p>\n<p>Plan your answer. Use the 10-minute perusal time to help you with planning and jot down your answer.</p>\n<p>Answer the question that has been set.</p>\n<p>Attempt to answer all parts of the question.</p>\n<p><strong>Make your diagrams and calculations clear. We need evidence that you have recognised and can demonstrate the correct equation and constants with correct units to award marks.</strong></p>\n<p>Use the rough paper to record your problem-solving of numerical questions</p>\n<p>Manage your time. Clarify the weight of the questions. Which questions are worth more? Allocate more time to these. If a question is worth 2 marks, don’t spend 20 minutes on it. If you have time at the end, you can come back and review questions that you haven’t answered.</p>\n<p>Make sure your details (question no, section no, and student ID) are written where they should be on the answer booklets.</p>\n<p>Practice on sample papers that are available through the library.</p>\n<p><strong>Dont's</strong></p>\n<p>Answer the question you hoped to see</p>\n<p><strong>Write answers which are not related/answering the question. This will be given a zero mark.</strong></p>\n<p>Write everything you know about the topic</p>\n<p>Avoid lengthy after exam debriefs. Focus on the next exam. You can always debrief later as part of the learning process</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
