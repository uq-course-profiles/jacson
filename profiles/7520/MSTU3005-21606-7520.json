Weeks 7 and 12 are assignment workshopping and revision weeks. They are optional but highly recommended weeks for helping you prepare your first and final assignments. </p>\n<p>You can earn up to 2 marks each week, and there are a couple of different ways to earn these marks:</p>\n<p>1. In-class speaking or google doc written responses. Each week I will email the link to a google doc before class. The doc will contain a question related to the viewing. Other questions will be asked in class during the seminar. You can <strong>write </strong>responses to these questions and post your own questions before/during class using the google doc, or <strong>verbally</strong> answer questions and contribute to class discussion with useful points that are informed by your listening, reading, and viewing of that week's course materials. To get 2 marks for the week you need to either participate twice in the verbal discussion or write two responses to questions in the google doc. Please sign the in-class attendance sheet so that your participation/engagement can be marked.</p>\n<p>The google doc allows you to answer questions in class at your own pace, but there is also a field in the document where you can write your own questions about the readings or suggest parts of the readings or topic that you would like to discuss in more detail. In class we will sometimes use your answers and questions in different ways as a jumping off point for discussion. </p>\n<p>2. After class worksheet. If you miss a class due to illness, you may do a catch-up worksheet for that week. If you learn better through reflection and revision of your own class notes, you can also submit the catch-up worksheet instead of participating in class. Worksheets will be made available in the Blackboard assessment folder soon after the seminar, and always before the end of the week. Submit your worksheet using the link provided in the assessment folder. </p>\n<p>Machine Translation (MT) may support students in completing this assessment task.

Lenses bring their own distortions, but also can allow us to see some things more clearly about how the screen relates to the reality of our world. This week's lens is feminist film theory (and practice) - which has been hugely influential on cultural discourse about gender as well as the work of filmmakers. Terms like 'the final girl' and 'the monstrous feminine' in horror movies come from feminist film scholarship, and so does (the often misused term) 'the male gaze' in relation to sexualised images of women in film, TV, and wider culture.
