A copy of the ESSA exercise science and sport science level 1 professional attributes has been made available on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>You must take into your consideration the following points when completing the ROSE form:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·      If you are intending on applying for accreditation as a Sport Scientist with ESSA, then you are required to use the sport science level 1 professional attributes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·      If you are not intending of applying for accreditation as a Sport Scientist with ESSA, then you are required to use ESSA exercise science professional attributes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
