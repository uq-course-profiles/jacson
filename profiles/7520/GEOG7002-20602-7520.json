To avoid repetition, each country can be selected by only one student per workshop. Students are encouraged to discuss their choice with their tutor or course co-coordinator to ensure that their case study is relevant, and that sufficient data are available.</p>\n<p>Your work should be submitted as a one-page pdf poster. You are expected to selectively create your own graphs and tables to support your arguement. Your poster should include a title, student name, student number and course code. Section titles for the introduction, conclusion, reference list (post-graduate students only) and relevant result sections are expected.</p>\n<p>Students will have 3 minutes to present their poster in Week 9 and 10 workshops and should be prepared to answer questions.
