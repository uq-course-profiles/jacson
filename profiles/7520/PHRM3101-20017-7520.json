Its primary purpose is to document evidence of activities that enhance students’ understanding of dispensing processes. Additionally, it serves as a platform for feedback and reflection on any errors made.</p>\n<p>This portfolio comprises three distinct activities that must be completed throughout the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>ACTIVITY ONE - DISPENSING TUTORIAL ACTIVITIES (6% total; 2% per submission; 3 submissions required; Maximum 2 submissions/tutorial): </strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the semester, you will participate in three dispensing tutorials. These tutorials will provide you with opportunities to practice and refine your dispensing and clinical skills through simulated practice. As part of these tutorials, you will work through a series of case-based scenarios, each accompanied by dispensing exercises that include a script and case details. Your responsibility in these tutorials will be to assess the legality, suitability for PBS dispensing, and clinical appropriateness of the scripts. If any issues are identified, you should discuss them with the tutorial facilitator and seek an updated prescription.</p>\n<p>For each dispensing tutorial, you will dispense the prescribed medications (after all issues have been resolved) and create dispensing labels using the Fred Dispense Plus software. The label, along with appropriate cautionary advisory labels (either incorporated into the label or as individual CALs), should be attached to the product images. The dispensed prescription and labelled product should then be provided to another student in your group for peer checking using the provided peer checking form.</p>\n<p>The document requirements for each submission include <strong>1)</strong> <strong>dispensed and labelled prescriptions and their associated labelled product images</strong>, <strong>2)</strong> a <strong>completed peer checking form</strong>, <strong>3)</strong> a <strong>short reflection on your dispensing process</strong> (&lt; 200 words). For example, did you experience any challenges with dispensing this prescription? Were there any decisions that you needed to make, and why did you make the decisions that you did? Was your dispensing accurate, or did you self-identify issues? Were issues identified during your peer checking, which required correction? How was your process speed? Were there any ethical considerations? Did you learn anything new through this process?</p>\n<p>A template containing sections for each of these requirements is provided at the Assessment link on Learn.UQ.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking: </strong>Marking consists of 50% (1%) where the dispensed items are free of errors and 50% (1%) for evidence of peer checking and reflection. Only the first THREE submissions will be marked. The marking criteria/rubric for this assessment task is available on Learn.UQ.</p>\n<p><strong>ACTIVITY TWO - ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION TRAINING (2% total): </strong>to enhance students’ proficiency in the processes involved in dispensing electronic prescriptions, students' are directed to enrol in the Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA) ‘Electronic Prescriptions and Active Script List (MySL) in Community Pharmacy’ module. This module is accessible through the ADHA Online Learning Portal (<a href=\"https://training.digitalhealth.gov.au/enrol/index.php?id=38\">link</a>). The module offers an introductory overview of electronic prescriptions, their dispensing processes, the advantages of electronic prescriptions and active script lists, the accessibility of electronic prescriptions in pharmacies, and the supporting policies and legislation. To gain access to the module, an account is required. Students can register for an account <a href=\"https://training.digitalhealth.gov.au/login/signup.php\">https://training.digitalhealth.gov.au/login/signup.php</a>. A mark equivalent to 75% or higher is required to pass this assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>ACTIVITY THREE - DISPENSING DURING COMMUNITY PHARMACY PLACEMENT (2% total): </strong>during the PHRM3101 community pharmacy placement, students are expected to actively participate in dispensing activities. This will provide an opportunity for a registered pharmacist to assess your dispensing capabilities and for students to gain practical experience with various dispensing platforms and processes, including dispensing robots, electronic prescriptions, and different script types. Students are required to dispense at least 10 prescriptions during the one-week placement period. After each dispensing, their preceptor should sign the dispensing record sheet and provide constructive feedback on the student’s dispensing skills. The prescriptions should include a combination of original and repeat prescriptions, as well as a mix of electronic and printed prescriptions. Prescriptions containing multiple items should be considered as a single dispensing. A template for recording your dispensing activities during the community pharmacy placement is provided at the Assessment link on Learn.UQ.</p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI and Machine Translation:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) technologies, successful completion of the assessment will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Student names and exam session times will be posted on Learn.UQ prior to the examination revision period. The marking rubrics for this assessment place a strong emphasis on patient-centred care. Students are strongly advised to download these rubrics (available under Assessments on the PHRM3101 Learn.UQ site) and become familiar with their contents.</p>\n<p>The oral exam comprises of two stations:</p>\n<p><strong>Station ONE </strong>(<strong>20%</strong>; Patient <strong>consultation on a respiratory device</strong>; <strong>5 min perusal + 10 min examination</strong>): In the first station you will be required to counsel a patient on a dispensed device. The counselling should be two-way, patient-centred and address patient concerns about the medication or condition being treated (this will be given to you in perusal time). You may need to consider the patient's medicines, new and existing. In this station, you will be required to demonstrate good communication techniques and a clear understanding of indication, dose, relevant (common or uncommon but highly significant) adverse effects, and general therapeutic counselling points of the condition being treated. Permitted resources can be accessed for this station.</p>\n<p>To aid in counselling the patient on how to use a respiratory device in station 1, a respiratory drug delivery device (or a picture of the device) will be provided during the exam. In the interest of safety, these will generally be training devices instead of branded inhalers. The student should act out how to use the device where they see necessary, but should not put the devices in their mouth, or point the inhaler towards themselves or the examiner and dispense a dose.</p>\n<p><strong>Station</strong> <strong>TWO</strong> (<strong>10%</strong>; Clinical <strong>Application of Drug Knowledge</strong>; <strong>5 min</strong>) In the third station you will be given an <strong>antibiotic</strong> for the treatment or prevention of a condition and you will be required to answer questions given by the examiner. The antibiotic will be a category 1 drug from PHRM3101 Personal Medicines Formulary (PMF) (available on UQ Extend) and will be different to that allocated to you in station 1. Resources will not be allowed at this station and there will be no perusal. The examiner will guide the discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Permitted Resources: </strong>an up to date AMH, APF and CMI will be made available for station 1. No resources are permitted for station 2. Students should bring a UQ student identification to enable identity verification. Students are permitted to bring a pen and a UQ approved calculator to the exam. Students are NOT permitted to bring any other resources into the exam. This includes, but is not limited to, notes, phones, textbooks, watches etc,</p>\n<p><strong>Academic Integrity: </strong>academic integrity is taken seriously at the University of Queensland. Communication between students (collusion) relating to the oral exam, during each exam session, is not permitted. To maintain academic integrity, students will be required to: <strong>1)</strong> show their UQ student identification card; and <strong>2)</strong> hand over mobile phones/computers/devices with communication functions at the entry to the exam. Audio (and potentially video) of this exam will be recorded and may be reviewed at a later date where required.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This exam will be recorded and retained as per university policy. The recording will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed if required for the purposes of moderation of marking; provision of feedback to the student; and/or re-marking following a successful re-mark application. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
