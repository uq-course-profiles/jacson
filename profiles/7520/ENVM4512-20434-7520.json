A key outcome will be a diagrammatic representation of the issue you have selected with clear and logical clustering of the problem components. You are also required to draw boundaries around the part of the problem that can be dealt with by a problem-solving team in an organisation. The diagram should be supported with approximately 1000 words of text. </p>\n<p>You must treat the assignment as though it was a consultancy in which a senior decision maker in a government agency or private organisation (NGOs, private enterprise etc.) has asked you to analyse and clarify the policy environment of the problem for them. You must point out the key features and implications of your analysis diagram for the client. Thus, you will have to find out which agencies are responsible for the issue you select. </p>\n<p>The following is a recommended outline for the assignment overall: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction: aims and outline of the assignment over viewing the purpose keeping in mind that you are writing it as a detailed Ministerial/executive decision-maker briefing. </li>\n<li>Brief explanation of how you determined the context and boundaries of the decision problem. </li>\n<li>Presentation of your problem analysis diagram. </li>\n<li>A summary of the key features and relationships in the analysis that should be brought to the attention of the organisation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Please be clear that you are not providing solutions to the topic for your client! </p>\n<p>The use of AI technologies: This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

By the end of the assignment, you should have considered the difficulties and rewards of identifying, engaging, understanding, and involving stakeholders – an essential component of all problem solving.</p>\n<p><strong><em>…in detail:</em></strong></p>\n<p>In this assignment you should adopt the position that you are responding to a direct request from a relevant decision-maker to the issue you have selected for the assessment. Assume that this person also has the responsibility for organising, facilitating and coordinating stakeholder engagement. Your stakeholder analysis report should provide a sound basis for them to make informed decisions about the nature of stakeholder involvement in resolving and managing the issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember </strong>that the aims of this assignment are about developing skills in stakeholder analysis (as a precursor to participation). Therefore, care should be taken to avoid falling into the trap of simply describing the technical, scientific, or apparently ‘factual’ attributes of the problem. You can assume that the person that you are writing the briefing document for is reasonably familiar with the technical aspects of the issue and is acutely aware of the importance of the issue for future policy decisions.</p>\n<p>Start the assignment by <strong>briefly </strong>introducing the increasing and important role of public participation and why it is imperative to get this ‘right’. Once you have introduced this concept you should explain how the document (assignment) will deal with the issues of identifying and analysing stakeholders in relation to the topic chosen. By starting your assignment in this way there is less chance of losing focus.</p>\n<p>In the introduction you should <strong>briefly </strong>describe the issue you have chosen. Following on from this introduction you should have a section on stakeholder identification and your analysis of them. Toward the end of the assignment present your recommendations for engagement and involvement of the stakeholders.</p>\n<p>We will be looking for justification of the “process” (i.e., how you did it and what criteria you used) in selecting and identifying the stakeholders. We will also be looking for justification of your recommended techniques for involvement. This justification should be based on wide reading of the literature and critical thought. Read the assessment criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Word length:</strong></p>\n<p>This assignment will be marked primarily on the quality of research, critical thinking, and analysis. You are strongly encouraged to use tables to assist with the identification, analysis and recommendations. Approximately 2,500 words</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested guide for an outline:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to assignment (including: a brief description of the problem from the decision-maker's perspective) </li>\n<li>A brief summary of the importance of stakeholders and their engagement</li>\n<li>Identification and analysis of stakeholders for between eight and twelve key/relevant stakeholders using a stakeholder analysis table </li>\n<li>Use Mitchell’s stakeholder analysis conceptual diagram to indicate the nature of each stakeholder in your problem.</li>\n<li>Make recommendations for how to engage with three different stakeholders in your problem and justify based on your analysis.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Research and reference material</strong></p>\n<p>You will need to read widely on issues of stakeholder involvement, public participation, community empowerment and a range of related topics. You will also need to read in depth on the social, political, cultural, and technical aspects of the case study you choose. This will necessarily require reading a range of sources from academic literature, grey literature through to media, popular press and Internet sites.</p>\n<p>Our broad recommendation is that <strong>less than 15 cited references are inadequate for this task</strong>.</p>\n<p>The use of AI technologies: This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
