The first advantage of superconductivity is the low electrical power consumption due to the low resistivity. Moreover, since the critical current density is quite high in magnets, applications required strong magnet like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will require superconductors. However, the major disadvantage is low critical temperature which required the application of liquid helium for cooling purpose in applications. Application and storage of liquid helium made the process complicated and expensive.</p>\n<p>In this laboratory practice, students will particularly learn (i) properties of different types of high temperature superconductors (ii) Testing the transport current carrying capacity in cryogenic environment (at 77K in liquid nitrogen) (iii) Analysis the transport current under bending strain effect (iv) microstructure analysis of superconductors using electron and optical microscope to investigate the current degradation after bending (v) Testing the superconducting magnet coil and generating high magnetic field (vi) data and result analysis for the laboratory report.
