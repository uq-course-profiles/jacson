This assignment prepares you for the literature review, which is Assignment 2. I encourage you to select a research problem for your project that you can relate to, which facilitates your utilisation of your prior knowledge and experiences. You should frame the problem into a researchable one and outline your plan to address it. You may use bullet points in your research plan section. You need to cite <strong>at least 5 academic references </strong>from academic journals or books. In addition, you may cite from non-academic sources (e.g., government reports, internet sources), where necessary. Please do not use Wikipedia as academic references for your research project. The required referencing style for your in-text citation and references list at the end of your assignment is APA 7th edition referencing style. The UQ Library website has APA 7th edition referencing style guide, which also has information on how to cite non-English references, lecture notes, and power points.
