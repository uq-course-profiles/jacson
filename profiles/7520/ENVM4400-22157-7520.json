In doing so, and based on some preliminary research, you are trying to map out some initial ideas on what the problems and challenges may be for the client.</p>\n<p>Importantly, we have made this an individual assignment so that each team member can feel free to express their view of the issues independently (ie. Avoiding too much early group think). By doing this early in the semester you will have a much richer and diverse set of insights into what the problems are and how the team may develop the project brief that is to be submitted later in a few weeks. We recognise this is early in the semester, but it is also an exercise in rapidly acquiring a well-developed appreciation for your client’s situation and how you may proceed in developing a project.</p>\n<p>You will notice that often the client has a general sense of an issue that needs resolution, but not have the time or resources to adequately define or analyse the problem in sufficient detail to start to develop appropriate solutions. For this reason, this early piece of assessment gives you an opportunity to draw on all your skills and knowledge (along some additional research) to creatively articulate what you think the key components of the problem are that need to be addressed or resolved.</p>\n<p>Each student in the team will write a short account (approximately 600 words maximum) that contains:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The context and drivers for the issue(s)</li>\n<li>A clear statement of the problem(s), and</li>\n<li>Some suggested options in brief of how the project may be approach by the team (i.e., what methods, approaches or tools may be used) with a very brief justification</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The outcomes of this early work will then provide a platform for the team to share and discuss how to combine insights from the team in developing the final Project Brief (assignment 2).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The document should be very clearly structured and presented, they should have a very clear aim (or aims) and a focus that holds the entire document together. In addition, your review should have a strong and well justified conclusion that links to and justifies your approach to the case study project. Formatting, editorial and proof reading really counts, so be sure that these tasks are also addressed when allocating members of the group to tasks.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
