You are able to choose the topic you wish to investigate. Below is a list of some examples, do not restrict yourself to these options, but use them as a starting point. It is important that you select a topic you are interested in. Please feel free to contact the academic Dr Angela Lees (a.lees@uq.edu.au) leading this module to discuss the topic you would like to investigate for this assignment if you feel unsure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Welfare of sporting animals, some examples include greyhound and horse racing; equine sports (dressage, camp drafting, cutting etc.), scent sports for dogs (tracking), and other canine sports.</li>\n<li>Welfare of working animals, some examples include working dogs (i.e. Herding dogs) and draught animals (buffalo, heavy horses, cattle).</li>\n<li>Welfare of wildlife, topics here can include captive animals, free-ranging animals, and pest species.</li>\n<li>Welfare of production animals, in the context of animals being bred for a specific purpose that may include as a human food source, some examples include grazing beef cattle, feedlot cattle, pigs, horses, poultry and avians (including meat and eggs), mink.</li>\n<li>Welfare in companion animals, some examples include backyard chickens, caged birds, guinea pigs, dogs, and cats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Once you have selected your topic you will need to prepare a 2000 to 2500 words (maximum) literature review, please note that this excludes your reference list and any included tables or figures within your literature review.</p>\n<p>In your review you will need to:</p>\n<p>i) define/describe the topic you have chosen to focus on,</p>\n<p>ii) highlight the potential welfare issues that could influence the animals involved,</p>\n<p>iii) then describe how you would evaluate the welfare status of these animals with reference to biological functioning and natural behaviour, and</p>\n<p>iv) discuss how welfare could be improved in these animals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Credibility &amp; References</p>\n<p>It is essential that you read and use peer-reviewed scientific literature from reputable sources. To help you decide on the topic you wish to investigate, think about what is interesting to you and then take a look in the literature to see if you can find enough evidence to support you in this task. There is no set limit to the number of references you need to use, and every topic may have different amounts of information available. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>General Formatting and Communication</p>\n<p>Your review must be typed, double-spaced, in font size 12, in Australian (British) English. You may find the presentation of data in the form of tables and figures useful. Where tables and figures are used, they must be labelled and referred to within your review - remember that table headings are to be placed above tables and figure headings below figures.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Summary of expectations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Words: 2000 - 2500 (excluding references and tables/figures).</li>\n<li>Reference Style: Journal of Animal Science</li>\n<li>All pages are to be numbered.</li>\n<li>Spacing and Font size: double line spacing, 12-size font.</li>\n<li>Tables and Figures need to be discussed and referenced in the text of the report.</li>\n<li>Tables and Figures need to be numbered in sequence and have a title.</li>\n<li>Australian English spelling</li>\n<li>Please use section headings to improve the readability of your review, and to help focus your thoughts. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
