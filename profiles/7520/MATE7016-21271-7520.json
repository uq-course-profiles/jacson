The certified power conversion efficiency has skyrocketed from 3.8% to 25.0%, owing to the materials’ intriguing optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility and lifetime, and long carrier diffusion length. To further improve the photovoltaic performance, the incorporation of a passivation layer at the interfaces of perovskite layer and charge transport layers has been recognized as an effective strategy to minimize the efficiency loss by suppressing the undesirable non-radiative recombination. In this laboratory practice, you will fabricate perovskite crystalline film through an antisolvent-assist one-step deposition method on passivation layer-coated substrates, followed by charge transport layer and metal electrode deposition. The photovoltaic performance of the completed devices will be evaluated.</p>\n<p>The laboratory practice will be conducted in four sessions: TiO2 electrode deposition (demonstration), passivation layer coating (practical), perovskite film fabrication (demonstration), hole transport layer and metal electrode deposition (demonstration), and property measurements (practical). You will work in groups of 3 or 4 students. Within each group, you will share the data obtained from the laboratory practice.
