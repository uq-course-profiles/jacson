The assessment has two components:</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Abstract</strong> : 200 words: Select the case that you wish to investigate for your case study. This should be a particular humanitarian crisis or emergency. It can be a contemporary or a historical humanitarian crisis. In this 200 word abstract, you should briefly describe the crisis or emergency and why you find it a compelling case to research.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Annotated bibliography</strong>: 800 word: Select four sources that you will use in writing your case study. Analyse each source and outline why you believe this source is appropriate for your case study, and how it will contribute to your case study.   Consider the strengths and weaknesses of the source. Consider how the different sources will work together or complement each other in producing your case study. Consider, for instance, balancing empirical sources with sources that help you reflect on broader conceptual issues that the case study brings to light. In choosing your sources, think carefully about the quality of the source. Is it a reputable source? Does it express a particular perspective? If so, do you need to balance this perspective with contrasting perspectives in your analysis of the case?</p>\n<p>You have 800 word for this component of the assignment, so this is approximately 200 words per source</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
