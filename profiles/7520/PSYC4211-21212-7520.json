Students will draw upon research, ideas and framework that relate to the topic being discussed that week (e.g., leadership, motivation) and use this to help understand and explain the problem. Based on their analysis, students should also think about ways to address the problem based on their approach. All presentations must be <em>polished</em>, <em>relevant</em> and <em>interesting, </em>and marks will be given to the team as a whole — so in part you will be assessed on your ability to work together and co-ordinate your presentation with other members of your team. Marks will also be deducted if you go over time, so it is important to test-run your presentations to check that the timing is right. You are allowed to use a script for your presentation, but we strongly recommend that you practice delivering it—so that you can develop/refine your presentation skills and minimise your reliance on a script (as this can reduce audience engagement).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
