Develop a case study:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the selected client's communication need or issue and its importance (based on the brief presented by clients in week 3/4).</li>\n<li>Demonstrate proficient knowledge of key theories and frameworks that inform strategic communication/public relations.  </li>\n<li>Identify and define, justify, and reference some of the theories and professional frameworks. You will situate and apply 1-3 theories (check recommended academic readings), and at least 1 professional framework (professional readings) that could be potentially applied to the client's communication need or 'issue' (e.g. Barcelona Principles 3.0, or \"Global Capability Framework\", or any of the Codes of Ethics see in classes). Students will make a case that proposes possible communication paths or strategies that may help the client solve their problem. </li>\n<li>The case study <strong>must</strong> include a minimum of 3 relevant academic resources (peer reviewed textbooks, academic journal articles, professional websites).</li>\n<li>The case study <strong>must</strong> include a <strong>real-life, communication/PR example/illustration </strong>(current - no older than 3 years) that is similar or relevant (in content or style) to the communication need or issue presented by the 'client'. This example wil help you illustrate and support your choice of theories and frameworks.</li>\n<li>It is important that students critically <strong>justify their choice of example and the way they used it to make their case</strong> about the client brief or the topic. </li>\n<li>Real life PR/communication examples may be found on the news media, on professional websites, or well-supported personal experience. Please try to avoid purely marketing/advertising cases <strong>unless they are relevant to the client’s case</strong>. <strong>Some interesting PR examples/cases will be provided on Blackboard in weeks 1-4 for guidance.</strong></li>\n<li>We will practice this assignment in tutorials/workshops where we will compare the quality and accuracy of real life cases found via generative AI vs. cases found via traditional research (mainly via researching the academic and professional literature). Both, the academic literature and AI tools <strong>MUST</strong> be referenced if you use them in your assignment . <strong>A failure to reference AI and machine translation (MT) tools may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. You must not mention your client's organisation name in your prompts when you use AI</strong> <strong>as copyright and privacy issues may apply</strong>. <strong>Professionals should always protect their clients.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>All the material used in your case study, including AI or MT tools, MUST be referenced academically (APA 7th). A failure to reference AI and machine translation (MT) tools may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Important NOTE: Use a narrative style to write your case study (do NOT use dot points). You are making a case and advancing a proposition that will hopefully be helpful to your client.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>B. Post to Discussion Board: </strong></p>\n<p>This task encourages digital engagement and discussion between students and teachers. To this aim, you are asked to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post your selected real-life PR/communication case or example <strong>(similar or relevant to the client’s brief) </strong>with a brief explanatory comment on Discussion Board (Blackboard) justifying your choice (follow the thread created in week 3 to this purpose).</li>\n<li><strong>You will write this post between weeks 4 and 6</strong>  <strong>client briefing sessions</strong> (preferably no later than two days before assignment 1 submission date) to receive feedback from the course coordinator/tutors. The course coordinator will personally reply to your posts with a brief comment to approve or disprove the example with additional recommendations if necessary. </li>\n<li><strong>This specific task is worth 5 pts via specific rubric inside the the overall assignment marking criteria</strong>.</li>\n<li>This assignment is the first step to design an effective strategic communication campaign or project. Understanding the client's communication need/issue, applying theory and frameworks, and identifying similar cases (in specific topic or style) is an important and critical part of the task that will equip you with problem solving skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

This task consists of a <strong>written 'Presentation' and an oral pitch (in tutorials) </strong>that will be prepared and submitted individually, or in your same groups - <strong>who are asked to work as real-life communication 'consultants'</strong>. The written part consists of a <strong>1500-word PR/strategic communication plan, delivered through professional presentation slides.</strong> Your <strong>presentation slides</strong> will include:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Your 'credentials' as Comm/PR consultant(s), logo, cover letter to the client, and an executive summary. Remember also to include client's logo and to be consistent with their style guide.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Your campaign plan or proposal to the client where you will deploy: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A refined/revised version of some of the elements already submitted in assignments 2 and 3, </strong>namely, (a) client's communication problem/need/issue; (b) outline research methods and main findings that informed del plan; (c) main goal(s) of the specific campaign; (d) strategic approach (holistic strategy); (e) key publics, (f) key message(s); (g) SMART objectives.</li>\n<li><strong>New elements that will be included and displayed in the plan:</strong> <strong>(h)</strong> <strong>Communication/action strategies and tactics; (i) Logistics: budget, schedule; (j) Proposed evaluation methods (which may be used in the future, after execution) that will demonstrate that the objectives will be effectively met; (k) Conclusion, where you briefly deploy the rationale, limitations, theoretical considerations (i.e. theoretical insights from assignment 1 that guided your plan); and possible ethical/legal considerations that might concern the campaign plan (if any) according to best practice frameworks; final recommendations.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>This is an important new item: In tutorials, in week 13 you will orally pitch (a) the main elements of your campaign plan (Issue, Goal, Objectives, a list of main strategies and tactics) and (b) Display (audio visually and/or graphically, via PPT or similar) ONE of the key tactics, assets, or collateral that you will propose in your plan (the most important - 'star tactic').</strong> The tactic may display at least one, or a combination of the following: Media release; community relations/engagement plan; a social media tactic (posts or series of posts); a website; a newsletter; brochure, poster or flyer; a blog post for the client’s blog or website; social media material; podcast or video; a PR event; a speech/conference; advocacy/lobby campaign; fundraising campaign; community relations/engagement plan, etc. During the pitch you will briefly and critically justify why this is your main tactic, its problem-solving features, and how it will contribute to the success of your campaign for your client. Tactics should aim to be effective, ethical, respectful, original, and socially aware. Should include relevant content, be visually attractive and meaningful in a way that meets the client's communication need. <strong>This task values 6 pts and will be evaluated in the rubric item 'Plan/Design' (final assignment)</strong>. <strong>The tutorial Pitch will be recorded</strong> (please let your course coordinator and tutor know in writing if you would prefer not to be recorded by either voice or image so accommodations can be made). <strong>The Pitch involves feedback about your progress from your teacher. Your tutors will tell if you are on the right track, or suggest any ideas that may improve your plan. You will have time after the Pitch to refine your final plan before submission (Assignment 4 written presentation). </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Your online written presentation slides must aim to have high a level of professional quality,</strong> include consultancy credential (a simulation), and should include <strong>some graphs or other illustrations, photos, or visual elements. </strong>All the elements in the presentation should be consistent with the <strong>client organisation's style guide</strong> and with the campaign goal. </p>\n<p>It is important that students take the most relevant <strong>MaPS training workshops, and Library, and LinkedIn Learning workshops in advance, during the first half of the semester.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your critical thinking and problem solving capabilities will be tested by this task</strong>.</p>\n<p>This task should be executed by the students and not by generative AI.

If you use any of these tools at any stage, <strong>you must not mention your client's organisation name in your prompts</strong> <strong>as copyright and privacy issues should may apply</strong>. <strong>All material used in your plan, including any AI tools, MUST be referenced academically (APA 7th). A failure to reference AI and machine translation (MT) tools may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recording of Oral and Practical Assessment</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>All presentations will be recorded for marking purposes via recording facilities available where the assessment takes place (eg. ECHO360, Zoom, camera device)  </li>\n<li>Recordings will be retained by the School of Communication and Arts for at least 12 months from the release of the final grade for the course.  </li>\n<li>Recordings will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed by authorised school staff for the purposes of: </li>\n<li>Moderation of marking;  </li>\n<li>Provision of feedback to the student(s) recorded; and/or  </li>\n<li>Re-marking following a successful re-mark application. </li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
