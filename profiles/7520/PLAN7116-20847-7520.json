Gradually completing the reading during the semester will help students prepare for the final quiz, stay engaged, minimise gaps in understanding, and avoid cramming.</p>\n<p>Note that submissions are time-stamped and no late submissions will be accepted. This is to allow the lecturer to read through the submissions before class so that any unclear points can be address during the lecture. </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment tasks prohibiting use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

The group portion will be more general, whereas the individual portions will involve case studies. Students will present and submit in a group (one presentation and one paper per group, clarifying who worked on the individual components). Any feedback received during the presentation (in Week 12) should be reflected in the paper (submitted in Week 13). The purpose of this assignment is help students integrate a range of issues discussed during the semester and translate them into a plan.

A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
