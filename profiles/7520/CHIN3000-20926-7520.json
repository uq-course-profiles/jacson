As a learner of Chinese, you are required to download a WeChat App to communicate with NS. Each of you will form a pair with one of the Chinese NSs through WeChat and start real life interaction with them. This task will be supervised by Ms Annie Wang who is the instructor for Wednesday tutorials. From Week 2 to Week 11, a weekly topic is assigned, you need to communicate with your NS language partner and accomplish the task assigned. All the tasks will be related to the lessons covered. Your interaction with the NS will be monitored by Annie.</p>\n<p><strong>Task details:</strong> The native speaker and the learner each should ask each other five questions in Chinese based on the topic assigned weekly (see list of weekly topics below). The questions asked must be understood and relevant answers must be successfully elicited. In other words, the student must ask the native speaker 5 questions, get a relevant answer to each question and at the same time she/he must answer each of the 5 questions the native speaker asks. The question-answer interactions should be recorded on WeChat in each individual group by using the “Hold to Talk” function. Practice before the recording is not only allowed but also encouraged. <strong>The deadline for the recording is 1pm on the following Monday of each week. For example, Week 2 recording is due at 1pm on Monday the 10th March 2025 (Week 3 Monday). </strong>The weekly topics are as follows. Both learner and NS are recommended to number their questions and answers, for example, wenti yi__, wenti er___, wenti san__; hui da yi__, hui da 2__, hui da 3__ …… This is to help the teachers mark your responses, although most of the time they are only silent listeners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Week 2 Topic: Self-introduction</li>\n<li>Week 3 Topic: Language learning experience (Unit 7)</li>\n<li>Week 4 Topic: Travel or accident (Unit 8)</li>\n<li>Week 5 Topic: Renting a room/apartment (Unit 9)</li>\n<li>Week 6 Topic: Seeing a movie or mountain climbing (Unit 10)</li>\n<li>Week 7 Topic: Lost something like a wallet (Unit 11)</li>\n<li>Week 8 Topic: Bad luck or environment pollution (Unit 12)</li>\n<li>Week 9 Topic: Birthday present (Unit 1 Vol 3)</li>\n<li>Week 10 Topic: First year birthday celebration (Zhua Zhou) (Unit 2 Vol 3)</li>\n<li>Week 11 Topic: Foreign accent (Unit 3 Vol 3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
