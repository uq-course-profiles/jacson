As a result, there is a small participation grade (10%) in this class. </p>\n<p>However, we know that people participate in and engage with classes in different ways. For example, participating in a class meeting might mean contributing your own idea or answering a teacher’s question, but it might also mean asking a question or taking notes that you share with your peers. Participation and engagement activities like these aren’t often factored into university grading, but they are important activities that can help you succeed.</p>\n<p>So that participation marks better reflect your work, in this class you will set your own participation goals, track your progress, and assess your own mark at the end of semester. This self-assessment happens in three phases:</p>\n<p><strong> Week 1: Set goals</strong></p>\n<p>At the start of the semester, think about how you have participated in other classes, and how you want to participate going forward. Set three goals for your participation in ENGL2440 tutorials. Write these down so you can refer to them as you move through the class.</p>\n<p><strong>Weeks 2-12: Participate and document</strong></p>\n<p>Over the course of the semester, keep track of the different ways you participate in class and engage with class materials. We recommend keeping notes on this since you’ll need to tell us about what you did at the end of the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Week 13: Self-assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Using the template provided on blackboard, submit a short reflection of <strong>no more than 300 words</strong> indicating what you did, how it helped you meet your goals, and what grade you have earnt. We will review it and, if all required elements are present, record the grade you have earnt.</p>\n<p>Everyone will participate in the class in their own way, but we do have basic expectations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remain engaged throughout the semester</li>\n<li>Come to class prepared to discuss the reading and engage respectfully with peers</li>\n<li>If you are unwell or unable to attend class for reasons that meet UQ's extension policy, you must contact your tutor before class to inform them of your absence and discuss other means to engage with the work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI:</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct</p>\n<p> <strong>Participation ideas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a lead in small group discussions</li>\n<li>Report on group discussion to the wider class</li>\n<li>Contribute an idea or talking point</li>\n<li>Respond to someone else’s idea</li>\n<li>Ask a question</li>\n<li>Answer someone else’s question</li>\n<li>Invite someone else’s contribution</li>\n<li>Take a break from talking to make space for others to contribute</li>\n<li>Offer up a useful example or interesting resource</li>\n<li>Look something up to help to you or others understand</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to give yourself a 10/10 you should demonstrate high attendance or that you have engaged in catch-up materials.</p>\n<p><strong>The grading criteria and template for self-reflection are available on Blackboard</strong>.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You are required to complete Part One and Part Two.</p>\n<p>First, you will evaluate an AI-generated piece of writing against the assessment marking criteria provided. This allows you to ‘fact check’ the information provided, consider the quality of the argument and use of the text, and assess the written expression and structure. Note, a solid working knowledge of the primary text is critical to assessing a discussion of it.</p>\n<p>Second, you will produce a revised version of the text, improving its clarity and coherence, and refining its argument and use of evidence through your own academic writing skills.                                                                                 </p>\n<p><strong>PART ONE: (5 marks)</strong></p>\n<p>Choose ONE of the AI-generated essays provided and evaluate it against the following criteria:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Knowledge and Understanding of the Text</strong></p>\n<p>·    Does the essay demonstrate an accurate understanding of the primary text?</p>\n<p>·    Are key ideas, themes, and details from the text accurately represented?</p>\n<p>·    Are there any factual errors or misinterpretations of the text?</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Argument and Critical Thinking</strong></p>\n<p>·    Is there a clear and logical argument in response to the essay topic?</p>\n<p>·    Does the essay engage critically with the primary text to substantiate its argument?</p>\n<p>·    Does the argument address significant aspects of the text, or is it superficial?</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Structure and Organisation</strong></p>\n<p>·    Does the essay have a clear structure, with a logical progression of ideas?</p>\n<p>·    Are paragraphs well-organised and focused?</p>\n<p>·    Is there a clear introduction and conclusion?</p>\n<p><strong>4. Written Expression </strong></p>\n<p>·    Is the writing clear, precise, and appropriate for an academic context?</p>\n<p>·    Are there issues with grammar, syntax, or word choice that impact readability?</p>\n<p>·    Does the language demonstrate fluency and sophistication?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Write a short commentary of <strong>no more than 200 words</strong> identifying the essay’s strengths and weaknesses based on these four criteria. It is not necessary to assign the work a grade, but you should ensure that you identify specific areas for improvement and support your commentary with examples.</p>\n<p>              </p>\n<p><strong>PART TWO: (15 marks)</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the commentary you developed in Part One, write an improved version of your chosen essay. You do not need to repeat every idea in the original essay, especially if you are expanding upon or developing parts of it. However, you should ensure that your revision addresses the weaknesses you identified, and that it demonstrates your own knowledge of and critical engagement with the text, as well as your understanding of academic writing conventions.</p>\n<p>Your revised essay should be <strong>no more than 500 words</strong> (including quotations).</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI: </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct</p>\n<p><strong>Note, too, that it is impossible to do well on this assignment with the use of Generative AI</strong>. While capable of producing grammatically correct text, AI lacks the self-awareness and analytical ability necessary to evaluate its own outputs. When tasked with doing so, it tends to produce variations on the same patterns, repeating the same issues without genuine improvement.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
