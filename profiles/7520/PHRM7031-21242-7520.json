See the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site for details and marking criteria. </p>\n<p><strong>(i) Blogs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are required to post blog entries. Postings must demonstrate that the task has been well thought through and completed. Postings must be reflective, insightful and succinct. Be mindful that students are required to read many contributions. Meaningfully comment on the posting of at least one student. Comments such as \"I agree with you that Amlodipine is a good choice for hypertension in this patient\" or \"Why did you choose amlodipine\" or \" well done, interesting case\" are okay to post but will not gain marks. In order to obtain marks you need to post meaningful comments e.g. \"I agree with you that Amlodipine is a good choice for hypertension in this patient, as the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend avoiding ACE Inhibitors in patients with this ethnicity\" or \"Why did you choose amlodipine? Even though this patient's ethnicity means they do not respond to an ACE Inhibitor, a betablocker may provide mortality benefit with his heart failure\". Contributions should provide a perspective that contributes to the learning of others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(ii) Surveys / Quizzes / Tests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide answers to a series of questions. In order to obtain marks it must be clear that students have made a meaningful attempt at the questions with follow up to correct the questions answered incorrectly.</li>\n<li>A reasonable attempt is defined as achieving at least 70% of all answers correct on final attempt.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(iii) Written Case Review (Module 2 only)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Module 2 will require students to develop one Written Case Review from your workplace or from a colleague, that demonstrates application of learning from a therapeutic area that you have learnt in Modules 1 and 2.</li>\n<li>The template for submission of your Written Case Review cases is available in the assessment section of Learn.UQ (Blackboard). You will be asked to post this as a blog. The template will limit the number of words in each section, so you will need to be succinct.</li>\n<li>You will also need to comment on at least one peer's written case review. Students who cannot find a case should discuss this with the course coordinator after the 1st tutorial.</li>\n<li>Vancouver referencing style should be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(iii) Green discussion boards </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are required to contribute to the Green Discussion Boards tasks within each Module. These discussion boards usually involve the discussion of a case. </li>\n<li>Every student is required to post contributions within the group's green discussion board and comment on other student posts by 1pm on the day before the tutorial.</li>\n<li>One member from each group will be required to upload a summary of the group's answers to their green discussion board <strong>by 1pm on the day before the tutorial.</strong> There is no word limit for this summary, but it is expected that it would be around 1 single sided page of A4.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(iv) Blue discussion boards and Tutorial presentation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are required to contribute to the (Blue) Tutorial Discussion Boards for each module to prepare for the Tutorial.</li>\n<li>Working as a group, prepare a presentation for the online tutorial.</li>\n<li>A 16:9 PowerPoint format should be used. The recommended template and marking criteria are available to download in the Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site.</li>\n<li>Each group member will be required to the post individual contributions on the blue discussion board.</li>\n<li>One member from each group will be required to upload the group's PowerPoint slides for the tutorial onto the blue discussion board for their group <strong>by 1pm on the day before the tutorial</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The online tutorials are scheduled for two hours on Thursday evenings from 7-9 pm Queensland time (check daylight saving for Southern states). These will be the day after the module activities are due.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>These task have been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
