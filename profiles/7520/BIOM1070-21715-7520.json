This exam may include multiple-choice, short-answer, label the images, fill in the blanks and other assorted questions. The exam's focus on each module will correspond to the number of lectures in that module. It will cover Lecture Modules 3-5 content, physiology practicals 2-6 and content from anatomy practicals.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to bring a laptop to the exam that meets the device requirements for Inspera. It is important that you check before the exam that your laptop meets the device requirements for using the Inspera Assessment platform. If you do not own a suitable laptop, you can <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-and-student-it-help/using-library-devices/laptop-loans\">borrow one</a> from the Library. The Library website <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/learnuq-blackboard-help/inspera-assessment/get-familiar-inspera\">Get familiar with Inspera</a> provides the latest information for students about using Inspera.
