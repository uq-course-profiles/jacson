You will be expected to use generative AI critically for both tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part A – Preparing a written report of an <strong><em>environmental scan</em></strong> for a specific client organisation; and</li>\n<li>Part B – Presenting a <strong><em>spokesperson</em></strong> <strong><em>response</em></strong> as a member of a team of organisation representatives being interviewed by media.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>In classes, you will be guided through a number of activities which help you to prepare for this assignment, including the use and critical analysis of generative AI.  </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Client Organisation</strong></p>\n<p>The client organisation you will be representing is Brisbane Airport Corporation (https://www.bne.com.au/corporate). </p>\n<p><strong><em>In the workshop in Week 4 you will meet with this client, and will be provided with further information. You will also have the opportunity to ask questions of the client at this session. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>When subsequently conducting further research for this assignment task, you should NOT approach the organisation directly. Instead, use your research skills to uncover information from publicly available information sources (for example, the organisation's website, the organisation's annual report, and media articles).  </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Report (Part A) – Issue and Stakeholder Scan </strong></p>\n<p>Prepare a 2000-word report of an environmental scan for<strong> Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC). </strong></p>\n<p>To conduct this analysis, it is expected that you will both incorporate information from the academic sources which have been set as the required learning resources for this course, and critically adapt generative AI outputs. You should also research publicly available organisational sources (for example, annual reports, websites), media articles, other cases/precedents where similar organisations have experienced the same issue or a similar issue. You should consult at least 15 sources for this assignment task.</p>\n<p>Your report should contain the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Cover sheet – Use of Generative AI</strong></p>\n<p>In line with industry practice, you will make use of generative AI for this task. You will need to: 1. Apply critical judgment to use and adapt GenAI output. 2. Complete the cover sheet provided to indicate how you have used GenAI in the task. See the marking criteria sheet for further details on how this will be assessed.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Client Organisation</strong></p>\n<p>Provide a concise profile of the organisation (name, location, size, number of years in operation, etc.), and an assessment of the organisation’s track record for the occurrence and management of issues. (You may also wish to include some wider assessment of the occurrence of issues in the sector.)</p>\n<p><strong>2. Issue Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Identify:</p>\n<p>(a) current issues the organisation is facing; and</p>\n<p>(b) issues which the organisation is likely to face.  </p>\n<p>Then, undertake an analysis of ONE (1) current or emerging issue which has implications for the organisation and/or its stakeholders, and particularly potential negative media consequences.</p>\n<p>You may wish to include in your analysis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the issue has occurred (or is likely to occur).</li>\n<li> What is being communicated about this issue (by whom, how, how frequently, using what channels).</li>\n<li>The impacts to the organisation (including reputational implications).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Stakeholder Identification</strong></p>\n<p>For the current/emerging issue you have identified, undertake an analysis of the stakeholder groups concerned. You may wish to include in your analysis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stakeholder main interests/matters of concern.</li>\n<li>Stakeholder perceptions, attitudes, and/or behaviours in relation to the issue.</li>\n<li>The degree of impact/influence of the stakeholders on the organisation.</li>\n<li>The priority of the stakeholders for the organisation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Spokesperson Preparation</strong></p>\n<p>For the current/emerging issue you have identified, use generative AI to prepare a list of up to 5 questions and responses which you believe will <strong><em>equip</em></strong> an organisational spokesperson to confidently participate in a media interview and represent the organisation effectively.</p>\n<p>Include a short critique outlining (250 words) how you evaluated and adapted the initial generative AI produced questions.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Reference List</strong></p>\n<p>Using APA referencing style, provide a complete list of all sources used in the preparation of this assignment.   </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI/MT</strong></p>\n<p>Please refer to the instructions provided on Blackboard regarding appropriate use and referencing of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for this assessment task.</p>\n<p>Machine Translation (MT) may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use MT in completing this assessment task.

Stakeholder Engagement Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>Present a recommended strategy for stakeholder engagement.</p>\n<p>In developing this strategy, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assess and prioritise the stakeholder groupings.</li>\n<li>Identify what information needs to be communicated to the stakeholder groupings, and how.</li>\n<li>Develop a strategic set of no more than 3 key messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Questions</strong></p>\n<p>Conclude the presentation by opening up a question time (maximum 5 minutes) for the Board of Management. (As a team, you should develop a strategy for addressing questions – prepare potential questions and answers, and nominate who should respond to which types of questions.)</p>\n<p>Following the presentation and question-time, the peer team will then participate in a brief feedback process with the industry representative.</p>\n<p>It is expected that you integrate information from academic sources which have been set as the required learning resources for this course.  Sources used in the preparation of, and in the content of, the presentation should be acknowledged within the presentation following appropriate academic referencing process for oral communication. You should also provide a reference list as part of your presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI/MT</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
