The course outline’s recommended readings should provide some guidance for reading material relevant to your topic, and all essays must draw on at least 2 sources from the course reading list- failure to do so will incur a 20% (6 marks) penalty. The essay should also attempt to engage at some level with theories and conceptual frameworks in international relations, although the extent of engagement depends on the question chosen. Finally, students should acknowledge and engage with counter-arguments to maximize the strength of their conclusions.</p>\n<p>Assignments must be typed (1.5 spaced), fully referenced and include a reference list (not a bibliography). All assignments submitted are to be the original and individual work of the student submitting them. The assignment must be submitted electronically through Turnitin in Word form (not PDF). Penalties will apply for late submissions (10% per day) and excessive variation from the set word limit- more than 10% variation from the word limit will result in a penalty of 10%.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
