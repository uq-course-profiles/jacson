You will analyse the newspaper and social media information to reflect on the importance of data and suggest solutions to a data ethics issue. The data ethics analysis paper will be a maximum of 3 pages + a reference page (15% weighting).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details of each component to include will be provided on Blackboard. The certification courses must be completed for the analysis paper to be accepted.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
