This written report will be based on the ecology we investigated on the CONS7025 field trip, and will be entitled “An assessment of the conservation values of camphor laurel regrowth versus intact native rainforest\".</p>\n<p>Your task is to provide an evidence-based assessment of the conservation values of camphor laurel regrowth in the Tweed valley relative to the original subtropical rainforests that they replaced following a history of land clearing. Your report should be a scientifically-sound analysis and presentation of the original research data we collected on the field trip. In addition, you should critically explore the published scientific literature relevant to this topic, including the relative costs and benefits of the passive versus active approach to forest regrowth and restoration. A key focus of this task will be developing and communicating a practical, achievable conservation solution that could be implemented in a real-world context!</p>\n<p>In terms of both content and style, authoring this document will help you to develop professional skills in writing, analysis and presentation that will be directly applicable to your future career, and it will give you the opportunity to apply your learning to a practical problem in rainforest conservation. <strong><em>Please note that further details to assist you in the preparation of this document will be provided in class tutorials and on blackboard.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
