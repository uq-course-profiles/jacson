It could be a deep dive into a personal experience, a profile, or a broad look at a way a group of people respond to an event or issue. Use what you have learned about storytelling and your chosen medium to haul us into the world of your narrative and surprise us with the insights you find there. When submitting your documentary, you should suggest a potential publication venue (for example, ABC, Vice, various podcasts). </p>\n<p>You will have the opportunity to workshop your concept, script and final product in the tutorials.  </p>\n<p>Students will be assessed using the rubric, available on Blackboard, which includes the weightings of each of the assessment categories. Feedback on draft submissions will be available in designated tutorial workshops. </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. Whilst Generative AI and/or MT can be powerful news gathering tools and primary sources, it also has the capacity to undermine audience trust in news and information, and the use of Generative AI and MT must be considered and transparent. Should you wish to use AI/MT in your assessment, you must: consult with your tutor to make an AI/MT integration plan; reference the use of an AI/MT-generated text, audio, video or imagery in the assessment coversheet; and clearly communicate the nature, use and rationale for using AI/MT-generated material within your story (e.g. through voiceover, supers etc; best-practice models will be distributed in class).</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
