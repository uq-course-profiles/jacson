Literature Review/Theoretical Discussion and Case Studies</strong></p>\n<p>Length: 2,000 words</p>\n<p>The assessment is a <strong>research exercise</strong> designed to assess your substantive knowledge of content presented in the course, relevant academic literature, and your ability to present and develop a cogent argument as applied to a specific context.</p>\n<p>The paper should be written in formal academic style and in correct, grammatical, and succinct English. The paper should be structured with an introduction that clearly sets out the thesis of the paper and previews its argument(s), a body that builds the argument(s), and a conclusion that integrates the argument(s) made and relates them back to the thesis and the question.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Students must answer the following hypothetical scenario:</em></strong></p>\n<p>You are working for the Department of Children, Youth Justice, and Multicultural Affairs and have been asked to advise on two cases involving young people. For each of the cases described, identify ‘risk’ and ‘protective’ factors for persistence or desistence from offending. Applying theories of juvenile delinquency (e.g., Moffitt’s Dual Taxonomy; Sampson and Laub’s Age-Graded Theory of Informal Social Control) discuss likely patterns of offending in each of these cases and appropriate approaches to intervention in the Queensland context.</p>\n<p>The first component of this assessment piece requires you to review the relevant literature relating to the theory/theories of juvenile delinquency, including evidence providing empirical support for these theories. You are then to apply these theories to the cases that are provided and write a brief discussion about possible interventions and the evidence for the efficacy of these approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>THE CASES YOU MUST DISCUSS WILL BE POSTED ON BLACKBOARD.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sources and Reference List</strong></p>\n<p>In order to <strong>pass </strong>the paper, you will need to review and reference a minimum of <strong>eight </strong>academic sources other than or in addition to the course readings to show your ability to identify relevant literature relating to your paper topic. Suitable sources include books, book chapters, and credible journal articles. Try to mainly use primary and secondary sources. You may use some tertiary sources <em>in addition to your eight academic sources</em> if necessary. These may include online statistics, newspaper articles, etc. Please remember: lecture slides, Wikipedia, and other university websites that offer theoretical definitions, etc. are NOT academic sources and should NOT be used as references.</p>\n<p><strong>Formatting</strong></p>\n<p>To avoid losing marks, essays must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typed (12 point font), double-spaced, and include a reference list</li>\n<li>2,000 words long (+/- 10% acceptable)</li>\n<li>Properly formatted (e.g., page numbers, paragraphs, etc)</li>\n<li>Using appropriate in-text referencing (APA style)</li>\n<li>Proofread for language and presentation (e.g., grammar and spelling errors)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 2. Check-in Discussion (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>This part of the task is designed to ensure you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are on track to complete your paper, meeting the requirements;</li>\n<li>that you have considered learnings from the course and how they are relevant to this task;</li>\n<li>receive further feedback on your paper plans so that you can produce your best work possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this assessment you will prepare a one-page plan of your paper (in dot points) and discuss it with the lecturer. You will bring your plan (either a hard copy, or on a device) to show the lecturer, who will ask you to explain your plan briefly and will ask questions/provide advice to assist you in completing your paper.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. If AI is utilised in this assessment task, it must be referenced and clearly explained why its use was necessary. Students must complete an AI usage declaration and submit it with their assignment. Failure to do so will result in a grade of zero for the assignment.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Further, To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
