Prior to your professional experience placement you should consult closely with your tutor to design an appropriate project to ensure that it addresses an issue of current relevance within schools. This project will be implemented during your professional experience placement. It should be closely linked to your everyday work as a teacher with a broad connection to improving students’ educational outcomes.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To choose a topic, you should draw on the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers and identify a particular professional learning need to improve your practice. You might relate this professional learning need to one of your teaching areas (secondary), a learning area (for primary), or a topic that you are really interested in. As you may not know your professional experience placement until just prior to commencement, remember to ensure that your research-based project, as one source of professional learning, could be conducted in any school type. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your proposal should include:</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction.</strong> Outline the background to your problem.
