The intent is to encourage the broader community to engage with the eradication program by searching for infestations or reporting them, or agitating officials for improved funding allocations etc. You can use humour, drama, boring-old-scientific-presentation etc., but the objective is to get a broader audience to engage with the science. Use whatever resources you have available to you to fulfil this task.   </p>\n<p>This assessment is worth 30% of your overall grade. It comprises 25% for the submitted video content, and 5% from student feedback on peer videos. This will assist students in critically assessing the value of scientific content in a digital setting. </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
