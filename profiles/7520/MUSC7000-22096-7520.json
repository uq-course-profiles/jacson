Your topic will be agreed upon primarily between you and your advisor, although the advice of the course co-ordinator may also be sought in this matter. You are <strong>strongly </strong>urged to consider your advisor's advice carefully (and that of the course co-ordinator, if applicable) in relation forming your topic.

Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Stating rationale and/or purpose of study, as well as outlining and elaborating the research topic/question.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>2. Body</strong></p>\n<p>Usually a number of chapters, comprising, among various possible elements: an examination of current research and related literature to the central purpose of the study leading to relevant research questions and hypotheses (effectively, a literature review); application of a valid research method and approach to address the principal questions or hypotheses, statement of results and discussion of the findings.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>3. Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Synthesising the main aspects of the study. The discussion and anticipation of further study demonstrate an awareness of the implications and further application of the findings in a broader context.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Students should download the template that is provided to students in the MUSSC7000 Blackboard site and follow relevant guidelines in the School of Music <a href=\"https://music.uq.edu.au/files/16914/music-academic-writing-guide.pdf\">Academic Writing Guide</a> .</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong></p>\n<p>You are required to use 12-point font size, a standard modern font, and 1.5 or 2 line spacing.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>\n<p>Submission of the thesis is through Turnitin (via Blackboard).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
