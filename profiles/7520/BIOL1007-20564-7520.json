UQ RiPPLE is a software tool where you will be asked to write questions, review questions made by others and answer questions. For each of the six modules in the course (Biological Chemistry, Microbiology &amp; Infection Control, Cell Biology, Genetics, Immunology, and Metabolism), you will create one (1) question, review five (5) questions and answer ten (10) questions. Successful completion of the creation, reviewing and answering <strong>task for each module</strong> will yield 2% of the course mark (<em>e.g.</em> 12% in total). Only questions that pass moderation will count toward creation marks. You will have to complete this before the end of each corresponding module. You can use the question bank for each module to help you study for your exams.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
