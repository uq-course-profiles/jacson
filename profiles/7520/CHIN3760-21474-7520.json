You can pair up by yourself. Otherwise, the instructors will randomly pair you up. The assessment item consists of the following four parts:</p>\n<p><strong>Part A </strong>(20%): Annotated analysis of a MT/AI translation version of a selected source text (Please pick out 10 errors within the text - words/phrases/clauses – for analysis; and write down your analysis in a separate paragraph as your comments on each error below the text.</p>\n<p><strong>Part B </strong>(15%)<strong>: </strong>Improved translation version (having addressed each error identified in Part A) with post-editing.</p>\n<p><strong>Part C </strong>(5%)<strong>: </strong>Commentary (Min. 200 words and Max. 300 words; include the word count at the end of Part C). </p>\n<p><strong>Part D: </strong>Interview after the submission of the written assessment (approx. 3 minutes based on this assessment). Scores for each individual can be adjusted based on the information gained through interview. The interview will be held during class in week 12.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
