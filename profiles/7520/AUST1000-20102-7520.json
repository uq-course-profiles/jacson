They put forward the position of an individual on a particular issue. While they express a strong opinion, they use evidence and data to support the position taken.

Instead, it should present Australia in new ways, exploring different aspects of the country based on what you have learnt in this course.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhibition Requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Items:</strong> Your exhibition will consist of eight to ten items.</li>\n<li><strong>Topics:</strong> Address at least five of the following topics from the course:</li>\n<li>Indigenous issues</li>\n<li>Land and nation</li>\n<li>Immigration</li>\n<li>Multiculturalism</li>\n<li>Asylum seekers and refugees</li>\n<li>Gender and sexuality (including LGBTQIA+)</li>\n<li>Cultural Cringe</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Media:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items should encompass a range of different media, such as:</li>\n<li>Visual material: paintings, cartoons, street art, photographs, films, TV programs, music videos</li>\n<li>Textual material: poems, songs, book excerpts, articles, posters</li>\n<li>Be creative! Ensure each item provides a credible representation of contemporary Australia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Captions and References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each item must be accompanied by a short explanation/caption of approximately 50-70 words.</li>\n<li>Include references for each item (minimum of 1 academic, peer-reviewed reference).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition, submit a 1300-1500 word rationale in essay format.</li>\n<li>The rationale should contextualise your choice of exhibition items and explain what understandings of nation/national identity are conveyed by your items.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>As this assignment asks you to respond personally and creatively, students are not permitted to use AI to complete any part of this piece. This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
