The three digital tools can aim at different year levels (for instance, an early exposure to a relevant idea, pattern, or phenomenon in year 8, its formalised mathematical introduction in year 10/11, and its advanced or formalised understanding in year 11/12). For each digital tool, design investigations, with details of teaching strategies to be used, appropriate at the year level that (a) capitalise on this resource to promote student understanding of your selected content, and (b) culminate in classroom discussions of students' insights into mathematical idea. Include informal, diagnostic, or formative assessment tools related to one of the activities.
