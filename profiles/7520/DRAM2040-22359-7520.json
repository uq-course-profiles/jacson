You must bring a copy of the relevant text (e-copies are acceptable) and any additional material to every tutorial, and you must have read them at least once. Attendance itself is not sufficient to constitute 'participation'. Participation means wiling involvement, active engagement with the text and the tasks at hand, asking questions, working well in groups, and demonstrating evidence of having listened to the lectures. To receive full marks, your tutor will need to see evidence of you having engaged with this full spectrum of activity.</p>\n<p><strong>For the final 1% of your weekly participation mark</strong>, you will complete one blackboard post of 100 words, responding to a specific prompt. Some Blackboard Entries will require responses to visual and/or audio-visual material. Blackboard submissions are due by the commencement of your seminar each week.</p>\n<p>Acting ability is not assessed. It is your responsibility to ensure that your attendance has been recorded. </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
