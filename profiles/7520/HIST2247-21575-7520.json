This was the legislation that enabled the removal of Indigenous children from their parents in what became known as the “stolen generations”. In this tutorial we examine this legislation, and the experiences of children who were removed to missions and other institutions, and fostered to non-Indigenous families. Their testimony comes in the form of personal narratives delivered to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC)’s National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families. This Commission, established in 1995, delivered its report, commonly known as the <em>Bringing them Home</em> report, in 1997. Despite considerable criticism from some quarters, the report has become the basis for popular understandings of the stolen generations, and for the national apology which was delivered in 2008.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>What is the significance of the term “protection”? What powers, and under what circumstances, did the NSW legislation grant to the “protector”? How did children experience the “protection”, and how did their experiences match with the intentions of child removal?

            "topic_description": "Week 4 Tutorial: Indigenous Children In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, all Australian colonies and states passed acts for the “protection” of Aboriginal Australians. This was the legislation that enabled the removal of Indigenous children from their parents in what became known as the “stolen generations”. In this tutorial we examine this legislation, and the experiences of children who were removed to missions and other institutions, and fostered to non-Indigenous families. Their testimony comes in the form of personal narratives delivered to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC)’s National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families. This Commission, established in 1995, delivered its report, commonly known as the Bringing them Home report, in 1997. Despite considerable criticism from some quarters, the report has become the basis for popular understandings of the stolen generations, and for the national apology which was delivered in 2008. What is the significance of the term “protection”? What powers, and under what circumstances, did the NSW legislation grant to the “protector”? How did children experience the “protection”, and how did their experiences match with the intentions of child removal? Why were reunions with parents often less than ieal? Are the children passive victims? Is there something problematic about non-Indigenous historians and governments writing Indigenous history? Is there too much emphasis on conflict and atrocity?

Even at the time, it was an unpopular war, and there was strong opposition to Australian involvement, and the use of conscription. This was heightened by the media presence during the conflict. Probably for the first time, there were graphic images of civilian casualties in war, and television brought the war into homes in a way that had not been possible before. Memorable photographs – most notably that of the small Vietnamese girl Kim Phuc, running from a napalm attack – scarred the Australian imaginary.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we consider how different sectors of Australian society remember and historicise this conflict. What was the experience of Australian troops in Vietnam, and in what regards are their popular memory tropes often historically inaccurate? What purposes do each of these tropes serve? How do veterans’ wives recall their experience of the war?

            "topic_description": "Week 9 Tutorial: Remembering Vietnam The conflict in Vietnam retains a dogged place in Australian national identity, in particular with regards to its inclusion/exclusion from the Anzac type mythologies. Even at the time, it was an unpopular war, and there was strong opposition to Australian involvement, and the use of conscription. This was heightened by the media presence during the conflict. Probably for the first time, there were graphic images of civilian casualties in war, and television brought the war into homes in a way that had not been possible before. Memorable photographs – most notably that of the small Vietnamese girl Kim Phuc, running from a napalm attack – scarred the Australian imaginary. In this tutorial, we consider how different sectors of Australian society remember and historicise this conflict. What was the experience of Australian troops in Vietnam, and in what regards are their popular memory tropes often historically inaccurate? What purposes do each of these tropes serve? How do veterans’ wives recall their experience of the war? And on what ways do the memories of South Vietnamese veterans throw a ”spanner into the works”?
