Both will require the completion of several calculations followed by answering questions on Blackboard. The questions will assess your understanding of the quantitative component of this work as well as their biological and agronomic applications.</p>\n<p>In the first part, students will engage in two laboratory-based practicals to generate data on seed germination of a range of economically important crop species. These data will be used to generate a class dataset that will then be analysed and used to help calculate crop seeding rates.</p>\n<p>The second part is scenario-based. In the scenario you are a research agronomist working for a plant breeding company. You will be required to demonstrate understanding of seed germination data to calculate seed quantity requirements for a research trial that seeks to optimise crop yields through manipulation of crop population density.</p>\n<p>For both parts, students will complete an assessment on Blackboard that will be active and accessible for one week from the date it becomes accessible.</p>\n<p>More information will be posted on the AGRC1024 Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
