You will have 30 minutes to complete and submit each quiz via Blackboard, starting at 8:05 am and submitting no later than 8:35 am. The quiz must be submitted by due time during the TBL session to avoid late penalties. Strict late penalties apply, since feedback will ONLY be provided on the second half of the TBL session, after due time.</p>\n<p>There will be 10 quizzes during the semester. Each quiz accounts for 1% of the total mark (in which each question accounts for a fraction of the total, .e.g if the quiz has two questions then each question is worth 0.5%), where the worst grade received on the quizzes will not be counted towards the final mark, for a total of 10% (10/10 quizzes).</p>\n<p>**To provide you with an incentive to practise your skills, full marks will be awarded if you provide a complete answer to each question, even if the answer is not completely correct. The correct answer for each question will be provided by the lecturer(s) on the second half of the TBL session. Please note that the TBL sessions will <strong>NOT</strong> be recorded.</p>\n<p>Since this assessment is designed to help you prepare for the final exam, you <strong>are allowed to and must use the material from the lecture to answer the questions</strong>. In order to mimic a final exam situation, you are encouraged to work individually. Browsing the web or using AI to answer the questions will not help you achieve the goal of this assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
