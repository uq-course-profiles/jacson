            "topic_description": "Trading Simulation In our course, you'll engage in three key activities: general lecture sessions, guest lectures from the industry, and trading simulation exercises. For a detailed timetable and to see how these activities are structured throughout the semester, please refer to the Blackboard site. WEEK 1 (4-5 PM) Introduction to the trading and hedging simulation This series of sessions is designed to offer a thorough understanding of trading in agricultural commodities using diverse trading platforms. Focused on equipping students with practical knowledge of agricultural futures and options, the trading simulation sessions are designed to not only acquaint learners with the fundamental mechanisms of these instruments but also to provide an engaging, hands-on experience. Students will gain invaluable insights into strategic trading practices, risk management and decision-making processes through interactive simulations and real-time market analysis. This comprehensive approach ensures a well-rounded learning experience, preparing students for active participation in the dynamic world of agricultural commodities trading. WEEK 2 (4-5 PM) Trading Simulation (Session 1) These sessions are specially designed for students to become familiar with the trading platform, an essential step in their learning journey. During these sessions, the instructor will demonstrate example trades, providing a practical and clear understanding of how to navigate and utilise the platform effectively. Students are encouraged to actively engage by asking questions related to their own trading experiences. These interactive sessions serve as a preparatory ground for their upcoming presentations, allowing students to apply their learning, clarify doubts, and gain confidence. The aim is to ensure that students are well-prepared, both technically and conceptually, for their presentations, where they will showcase their trading strategies and insights.
