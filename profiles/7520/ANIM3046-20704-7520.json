This has typically been done with the target to improve productivity in production species. As such selection has predominantly focused almost exclusively on selecting animals for specific production traits e.g. improved milk production in dairy cows; decreased fat deposition in pigs. Other areas have focused on selecting for improved fertility, disease resistance, survivability and product quality. As a general rule of thumb, traits that have been focused on are those that can be measured such as speed, litter size/reproductive performance and growth rate. More recently there has been more thought given towards selection for increased adaptability. Some of this shift in focus has come about due to increasing environmental pressures on populations, including companion, production and wildlife species. This has come about for a couple of reasons, but a central aspect is associated with the demands conflicting with increasing climate challenges due to climate change. In this context wildlife species are also under growing stress due to habitat changes from the pressures of changing environments, and adaptive changes have already been documented. Essentially, this means that there has been a shift towards selecting animals to focus on those that are able to tolerate various stressors. For this assessment you are to undertake a review of the literature in the area of “the genetics of adaptation” with a focus on a specific animal and a specific stressor.</p>\n<p><strong>Credibility &amp; References</strong></p>\n<p>Whilst you may not enjoy spending your valuable time in the literature, it is essential that you will read and use peer-reviewed scientific literature from reputable sources. These days in the online world access to scientific literature has never been easier, so take a look in the literature to help you decide on the topic you wish to investigate. Many of you will start asking about how many references are expected, there is no set limit, you need as many references as you need to complete the task on the topic you have selected. However, you have 2000-2500 words to cover, so it would be anticipated that roughly 20-30 references could be used, although this will be associated with the topic being discussed.  </p>\n<p><strong>General Formatting and Communication </strong></p>\n<p>Your literature review must be typed, double-spaced, font size 12, in Australian (British) English and neatly presented. Communicating your thoughts in a concise and grammatically correct manner is essential to any written document, here at The University of Queensland or outside this institution. You may find the presentation of data in the form of tables and figures useful. Where tables and figures are used they must to be labelled and referred to within your review - remember that table headings are to be placed above tables and figure headings below figures. </p>\n<p><strong>Summary of expectations </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Words: 2000-2500 minimum (excluding references).</li>\n<li>Reference Style: Journal of Animal Science</li>\n<li>All pages are to be numbered.</li>\n<li>Spacing and Font size: 1.5 line spacing, 12 size font.</li>\n<li>Tables and Figures need to be discussed and referenced in the text of the report.</li>\n<li>Tables and Figures need to be numbered in sequence and have a title.</li>\n<li>Australian English</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A more comprehensive guideline will be provided to you on BlackBoard and an information searching workshop will occur as a part of the tutorial series. </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
