Participation in all steps involved in research, including the formulation of research questions, study design, ethics considerations, data collection, and data analysis, will be required. All students within each team will collect data to contribute towards common research databases and research questions. Outside of the team meetings/workshops, students will work independently to analyse data and create a thesis. When possible, and according to the needs of the research project, team meetings/workshops will focus on practical skills required for successful research and practice in psychology as well as research and writing skills. Students will be assessed on the independent research thesis that they will write throughout the course. The length will be from 5,000 words to 6,000 words (excluding tables, figures, references, appendices, etc.). Theses under 5000 words will not receive a passing grade.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
