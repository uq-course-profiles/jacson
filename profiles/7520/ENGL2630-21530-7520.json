This critical reflection should be in terms of the text’s style, techniques, or form, and the text’s subject matter and/or themes as impacting on your reading practice.</p>\n<p>You will need to research your texts, using critics who’ve analysed them to help your interpretation of the texts and to inform your reflection. A comparative analysis is encouraged, so consider how your two texts differ in the ways they want you to read otherwise. A critical reflection means you must be analytical in thinking about your reading practice—including your subjective response, and includes evaluating the texts—namely, which is the more effective and why. You will need to quote from the texts and include secondary sources (using a minimum of four scholarly sources) as evidence. You should use conventional essay style: so ideas organised logically into paragraphs, with an introduction with a thesis statement, a body, and a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Length: 1100-1300 words, including quotations.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale: </strong>This essay allows you to critically reflect on two of the first five primary texts in relation to some of the key concepts of postmodernism so far covered. Being a relatively short essay, it enables you to try out some of your ideas, and to practice your research, analysis, and writing skills before the longer essay.</p>\n<p>Please note that any primary texts you choose for this essay can't be used for your final essay.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
