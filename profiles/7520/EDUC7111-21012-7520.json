At the conclusion, provide a 200-300 word reflection on why you chose this topic and what you learnt about international students from your situated position.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>2.\tEugenics was once regarded as a science of improvement. Variously acclaimed and discredited, eugenic logics nonetheless remain implicit in systems of governance, social policies, academic disciplines and professional practices. Drawing on your knowledge of the discursive and material processes of globalisation, explain how eugenic logics may have influenced your chosen field. It is important that you start from a specific place/context and use a policy or testing instrument, or disciplinary practice as your focal point. You may want to consider a specific policy introduced to provide support for students with a disability, a particular learning assessment tool used in the cognitive sciences, or the use of a screening test. At the conclusion, provide a 200-300 word reflection on what you learnt about the global reach of eugenics logics from your situated position.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>3.\tMuch has been written about the need for education systems to respond to globalisation. Education institutions and systems more broadly are also agents of globalisation – i.e. that they construct visions of territories, resources and people within globalised world. Your task is to identify and discuss the different metaphors of competitiveness used in and by education institutions. Choose a formal policy text or an informal text to situate your analysis. At the conclusion, provide a 200-300 word reflection on what you learnt about citizenship from your situated position.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You are permitted to use generative AI tools to assist you in completing assessment tasks in EDUC 7111. However, you must acknowledge and reference the use of these tools. 100% AI generated assignments are not acceptable. You are expected to use a minimum of eight (8) relevant references to inform your analysis to include peer-reviewed material from credible journals.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>All referencing must be in accordance with the APA 7 style. Details for this referencing mode are available here: https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7. You must adhere to the University’s policy on academic integrity in producing your work. https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/student-integrity-and-conduct/academic-integrity-and-student-conduct</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
