            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>A core feature of this course is developing students’ ability to think critically about real business cases, and to effectively communicate thoughtful, theory-based recommendations for improving performance management practice. The case analysis assessment is meant to expose students to a variety of performance management questions/issues that they may encounter and be expected to analyse and resolve in an HR-related job, as HR consultants, as managers/supervisors, or in a situational interview. Moreover, this assessment tests students’ ability to do this a realistic context that involves actual performance management problems, full access to any resources they wish to draw upon (i.e., open-note), analysing problems in real-time, and selling recommendations to sceptical managers, drawing on team collaboration and individual efforts.</p>\n<p>In this course, you will be placed into a group for the semester. As a learning exercise in weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11, your group require to prepare a brief executive summary (600-750 words) relating to the case study. Students will prepare for weekly seminar meetings by carefully preparing for an assigned business case. Students will receive \"burning question(s)\" for the cases a week in advance. Students shall come to class prepared with notes, meet in groups of about five to critically analyse the case and respond to the burning question(s). Based on the group discussions, students then write up an Executive Summary <strong>as a group</strong> for that case outlining their analysis and proposing recommendations that are justified clearly using course concepts, ideas, and theories.</p>\n<p>This assessment requires you to only submit four (4) executive summaries for marking over the semester. Whether you choose to prepare an executive summary each week is up to your group to decide. Your facilitator will provide you with feedback on your submission each week so that you can make improvements where needed in your subsequent submissions.</p>\n<p>The best 3 marks will contribute towards the final grade for each group.</p>\n<p><strong>Each group will submit the Executive Summary both in Blackboard and Turnitin. </strong></p>\n<p>At the end of each Executive Summary, you will be required to submit details of the contributions of each member of the group. Contributions will be used to adjust students' individual group assignment results.</p>\n<p><strong>A Note on Teamwork:  </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although we hope all team members will work happily with each other and learn from each other, problems can occur. If so, please first deal with this issue immediately with your team member. To excel as business leaders, you will need to deal openly, constructively, and in a timely manner with any issues in your team.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Consistent problematic issues regarding team member participation will prompt a meeting with the course-coordinator with the intent to reintegrate the erring member. Uncooperative members run the risk of having their grade reduced to account for their behaviour’s assumed negative effect on their team’s project and as a deterrent to social loafing.</em></strong></li>\n<li>It is strongly recommended that each team appoint a Secretary-Recorder (This can be a rotating or shared role), who will maintain a log of all team activities (including attendance at meetings and team member follow-through on commitments) for my review upon request in the event of problematic team members.</li>\n<li>You are encouraged to have a Leader to facilitate the teamwork. Again, this can be a rotating or shared role to give everyone the opportunity to lead. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>AI Statement:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
