The expectation in this course is that you engage with these readings prior to attending the weekly session (live or online or recorded) in the week for which the reading is assigned. This requirement is intended to maximise your understanding of the course content and prepare you for asking questions during the course discussions.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>As a Master’s student, you carry the responsibility for monitoring your participation and engagement with the course content. To demonstrate your sustained participation, you are required to submit a written report on two or three of the required course readings (500 –750 words total in a single word document) and discuss how these readings changed, challenged, or enriched your perspective of educational research.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In your report, you may</p>\n<p>• Summarise the key issue in each article and comment on how or why this made you think differently about research in education</p>\n<p>• Explain why this issue is of importance to the field</p>\n<p>• Explain how this issue is relevant (or not relevant) to you as an education practitioner in a specific context</p>\n<p>• Include questions that the article motivated you to ask or wonder about</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Note that this mark acknowledges your sustained, disciplined work through the course content. “Pass” does not depend on the ‘quality’ or ‘accuracy’ of your interpretations of the readings. It also does not depend on your skill in English academic writing (that is, any submitted reflection on relevant readings of required length will be awarded a “pass” grade). </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task is intended as a safe ‘training ground’ and a means of getting regular practice in academic writing and/or in formulation of an argument, without huge consequence for your final grade. In addition, you may use this task to trial the use of TurnItIn submission system.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Submission are possible between weeks 5 and 13.
