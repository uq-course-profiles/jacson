While this is an independent task, you will engage in a moderation process with a partner for part of the assignment. The task is split into three parts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part A: Assessing writing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To begin, you and your partner will select a sample of a primary school student’s writing as listed on Blackboard. Your sample may be an imaginative, informative, or persuasive text. You should have the same sample as your partner if possible.</li>\n<li>Separately from your partner, analyse your selected writing sample for its macro (structural) and micro (linguistic) choices. Drawing on information taught in the course and the <em>Australian Curriculum: English</em>, write annotations that identify strengths and weaknesses in the writing sample.</li>\n<li>Prepare a short piece of written feedback for the student who wrote your writing sample, including positive comments and areas for improvement. Also, include a statement about the purpose of timely and appropriate feedback to students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part B: Moderation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You and your partner will then moderate each other’s analysis, annotations, and student feedback. You may wish to change and improve your work in response to the moderation.</li>\n<li>Keep a record of your discussions and draw on this to write a brief explanation about what your moderation process involved, and how it supported your judgements of student learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part C: Planning and assessing a writing activity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using your analysed student writing sample from Part A, identify one macro (structural) or micro (linguistic) choice that could be improved the student’s writing and plan a suitable activity aimed at a small group of students with similar needs.</li>\n<li>Select one Content Description from your student’s year level in the <em>Australian Curriculum: English</em> that relates to your identified choice for improvement.</li>\n<li>Select a mentor text to support your writing activity.</li>\n<li>For your writing activity, include:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>One or more achievable yet challenging learning goal(s), communicated through learning intentions and success criteria in student-friendly language.</li>\n<li>A description of how you will teach your identified macro (structural) or micro (linguistic) writing choice using the teaching and learning cycle, your selected mentor text, and other appropriate resources including effective use of Information and Communication Technology. Ensure your teaching strategies cater for the needs of students from diverse backgrounds.</li>\n<li>An indication of how you will assess student learning.</li>\n</ol>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
