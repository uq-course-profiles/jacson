Students will be given a design scenario and/or example process data. Students may be required to select appropriate wastewater technology for the scenario and complete a series of calculations to design equipment and evaluate the expected performance of that equipment. Students will present design outcomes (i.e. as an equipment specification sheet) and performance evaluations (i.e. mass/energy balances and/or calculations showing economic, environmental or safety impacts of operation). Students will report on major assumptions and discuss the impact of these assumptions. Each student will have to submit a design package containing a completed design template/equipment specification sheet, design calculations and engineering drawings as appropriate (PFDs and PCD/P&amp;ID).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>1. Students will design an anaerobic treatment process (Week 4, Friday 2pm)</p>\n<p>2. Students will design an activated sludge/BNR process (Week 8, Thursday 6pm - due at the completion of the workshop class)</p>\n<p>3. Students will design technology for disinfection (Week 10, Friday 2pm)</p>\n<p>4. Students will design technology for solids/sludge management (Week 13, Friday 2pm)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
