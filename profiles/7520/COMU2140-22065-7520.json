This is a kind of parody writing project where you will develop a creative narrative for pitching your platform idea to its potential user/customer groups, such as individual end-users and corporate complementors, and to your investors. For the common rhetorics and narratives of platformization you will make a parody of, you can refer to the “About Us” or similar pages of popular lean platforms such as Uber and Airbnb. Writing a parody of them means that your “About Us” pages will also follow this marketing language of platforms but in an exaggerated and twisted manner as you may find in other parody works, such as “honest movie trailers” on YouTube, to make visible otherwise invisible business practices that platforms usually try to put aside from the users/customers’ views while emphasizing the benefits and opportunities they promise to the people. You can use any webpage design tool and hosting service while encouraged to use WordPress that we will workshop about in Week 6 tutorials. You are required to submit the text version of the website alongside the link to your active webpage to Turnitin. Your webpage should include the following sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>About us (100-200 words): A clear mission statement of the platform, providing an effective keyword that describes the product/service domain (e.g. “Mobility” or “the way the world movies” for Uber) and illustrating how the platform redefines/reimagines this domain.  </li>\n<li>Our offerings (300-600 words): describing the services/products it offers to each user/customer group.  </li>\n<li>How it works (300-600 words): a step-by-step manual of the platform app, explaining the way in which its algorithms work to realize its promises.</li>\n<li>Impact (300-600 words): ethical goals or community services that it is committed to, especially concerning the current challenges in social, economic, and climate-changing worlds.</li>\n<li>Investor relations (300-600 words): explaining its commitment to corporate responsibility (for data privacy, service/product accessibility, workplace safety, etc.) and future vision (of its ecosystem/ecosphere scalability, diversification of service provisions, etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides the effective delivery of information, your PARODY of platform language will need to include/explain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For EVERY good thing that the platform says it provides or is committed to, the trade-off the platform requires its customers to pay. </li>\n<li>Effective language (or very effectively exaggerated language) to assure the customers that this trade-off is almost ignorable compared to the platform's benefits.  </li>\n<li>(Probably in the “Investor relations” section) How its core architecture--interface plus algorithms--organizes a sustainable and expandable business model; a) Sustainability based on continuing user contributions. b) Expandability through established platform-user relationships (e.g. users’ reliance on platforms, their willingness to contribute to the community the platform organizes, and the interactions that the platform facilitates between customer groups on different sides of the market.).  </li>\n<li>Effective language to draw continuing user contributions.</li>\n<li>How it outsources risks, costs, and responsibilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least three distinguishable customer groups should be identified alongside three distinguishable services the platform provides for each.  </li>\n<li>At least four concepts from lectures (e.g. affordances, network effects, cross-subsidization, ecosystem, technological lock-in, multi-sided market, rentiership, demand-side economics and supply-side economics, attention economy, participatory and convergence culture, choice architecture/engine, etc.) should be mentioned in the right places and correct ways.</li>\n<li>Your imaginary platform could be anything but another ride-hailing service.</li>\n<li>The service your imaginary platform provides can be that which has already been serviced by other platforms, while the case that identifies a new “promising” service/product domain for platformization is highly welcomed.</li>\n<li>Effective use of visual elements and a clear layout are required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
