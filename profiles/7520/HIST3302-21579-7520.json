This handout is to be circulated to the class in hard copy on the day of the tutorial discussion (to be used as a basis for the discussion), and should be submitted via Turnitin by 2 pm on the day following your presentation. The usual penalties for late submission will apply for this item of assessment. </p>\n<p>The 'Short Paper' is worth 10%, and should present a clear and well-structured response to the selected question, emphasising the insights gained by your reading for the topic.

Advice and expectations for each of these are provided below. </p>\n<p><strong>Research Essay</strong></p>\n<p>If you choose the Research Essay format, you should adopt one of the tutorial questions as the basis for a longer discussion in essay form (2000 words). Alternatively, you may wish to develop an entirely original topic. In either case, you are required to discuss your topic and the relevant research materials and strategy with the course co-ordinator before commencing major work on this assessment item. </p>\n<p>As a general rule, your topic should explore aspects of a particular city in its historical context, and develop an argument to explain certain observable features or patterns. These cities should differ from the city discussed in the essay that you submitted earlier in the semester.</p>\n<p>One approach would be to examine the importance of a particular historical factor (such as mass immigration, religious affiliation or persecution, commercial and manufacturing activity, ideology or political activism) in shaping the evolution of a key international city through time. Another would be to examine the significance of a key event or historical development in the history of a specific city (i.e. the fall of Constantinople, the re-development of Paris during the Second Empire, Delhi during the 1857 revolt, Singapore in the era of globalisation). </p>\n<p>Another option is to take a historiographical approach, comparing the work of various historians on a major city or important urban theme. Yet another approach could be to examine the historical accounts left by explorers, independent travellers (including nineteenth century women travellers), diplomats, soldiers, merchants and businesspeople, tourists and those on religious pilgrimages. Such accounts can be critically assessed in various ways as historical evidence to illuminate a theme or topic. </p>\n<p>It is very important that you state a clear topic (that implies a question to be answered, or analysis to be developed) in the title of your essay. Please follow the Chicago 17A style, with footnotes and bibliography. Do not use in-text citation.                  </p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Formats </strong></p>\n<p>A Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) approach you to choose an alternative format for your research work in this course. You should discuss your topic and the relevant research materials with your tutor before commencing reading and research, and before commencing your Project Proposal (see below).</p>\n<p>Suitable formats for your research project include: a scholarly travel guide to a city; a website presenting sources and interpretation of a particular city or urban theme; a You Tube video documentary on the history of a city; a podcast exploring an aspect of urban history; a digital resource about a city such as an ARC GIS StoryMap; an online diary of travel to a city which includes scholarly insights; a proposal for an exhibition on the history of a city; an illustrated travel article for a newspaper or magazine; a family history about living in a particular city. </p>\n<p>Please bear in mind that a Research Project (whatever format is used) should be based on original historical research, appropriate primary and secondary sources, and your own analysis and interpretation written in clear and analytical prose.</p>\n<p>Whatever form the project takes, a version of it that documents your use of sources should be uploaded via Turnitin as well. That version should include text, footnotes (Chicago 17A), and a bibliography. Where appropriate, illustrations and/or sound files can be included. All projects must be submitted via Turnitin by the deadline. In the case of a digital resource, the text should be submitted to Turnitin and a link to the resource provided.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Research Projects are to be completed in two stages: </strong></p>\n<p>Stage 1: You should complete a Project Proposal (structural outline) of no more than TWO PAGES, setting out your introduction, rationale and justification, your key ideas and themes, the main sources you plan to use, your selected format (if not an essay) and tentative structure. Obviously, these may change before the essay is completed, but it is important for you to provide an initial statement of your ideas, direction and proposed structure for the essay. </p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: do not use dot points in your proposal. Instead, present your summary in short and well-focussed paragraphs. </p>\n<p>Your Project Proposal is to be submitted through Turnitin in Week 10 (7 May, due at 2 pm). This will be marked out of 10 and returned with written comments by the end of Week 11.</p>\n<p>Stage 2: The final version of your Research Project is due on 9 June (2 pm), and should be submitted through Turnitin on the Course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>You will be given a mark out of 40 for the completed essay. Together with the mark for your Essay Proposal this will represent 50% of your semester result.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
