In a sense, a large case study can be regarded as an enhanced version of a small case study as a large business case is much longer and represents a more complex business situation.</p>\n<p>During the first tutorial, five student teams will be formulated (usually 3-5 students per team, depending on class numbers).

Students are required to submit their summaries to the Blackboard <strong>in the tutorial</strong>. You will receive one mark for each submission. In total, you have <strong>seven (7) opportunities</strong> (i.e., for small cases 2 and 3, plus 5 large cases) to submit your summaries and receive marks. Please note that you will only receive a maximum of 5 marks even if you submit seven case study summaries to the Blackboard.

To do so, you need to <strong>think critically</strong> and <strong>introspectively </strong>about your overall learning process in the course.</p>\n<p>Reflections are <strong>more personal </strong>and <strong>introspective</strong> than standard academic essays, requiring <strong>a first-person account</strong> and <strong>critical analysis</strong> and <strong>interpretation</strong> of your learning experiences in the course. Nonetheless, your reflection paper should have a similar structure to a standard essay, consisting of three parts, namely an introduction, body, and conclusion. Specifically, your reflection should include the following four sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>introduction</strong>, you should briefly provide key background information for your reflection (e.g., motivation for taking the course, objectives, etc.). You should also identify some key activities that you feel have been helpful to your learning this semester (e.g. critical discussions of small case discussions, teamwork, etc.) and explain why?</li>\n<li>The <strong>main body</strong> consists of <strong>two sections</strong>, namely Section A and Section B. In <strong>Section A</strong>, you are required to identify <strong>two</strong> <strong>key topics</strong> (e.g., Just-in-time/ lean production and supply chain management) you have come across during the semester and critically analyse how and why they have had a positive impact on your learning in relation to your <strong>knowledge base.</strong> These topics should be analysed by relating them to <strong>suitable cases</strong> discussed in the tutorials and by referring to <strong>appropriate journal papers</strong> through literature research.</li>\n<li>In <strong>Section B</strong> of the main body, you need to identify <strong>some</strong> of the <strong>key learning activities</strong> you undertook (e.g. critical discussions of small cases, skills development workshops in Tutorials 1-3, etc.) during the semester and critically analyse how and why they had a positive impact on your <strong>skill development</strong>.</li>\n<li>Finally, in the <strong>conclusion</strong> section, you are advised to consider <strong>summarising</strong> what you have learned about the subject and how your learning has changed your <strong>perspective</strong> on your chosen field of study and/or addressed a gap in your knowledge base, as well as how your learning experience has shaped your <strong>career aspirations</strong> or <strong>employability</strong> in the future. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: your reflection paper should <strong>not exceed 1,200 words (excluding the title, tables (if any) and references)</strong>.
