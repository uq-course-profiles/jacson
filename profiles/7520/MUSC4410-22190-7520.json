MindMup, Inspiration, CMap). This task allows students to demonstrate an understanding of the literature that will frame the literature review of their major assessment item (Research Proposal). Links to each student's individual map must be embedded in a word document and uploaded via turn-it-in. Students must integrate the ideas from at least 10 peer-refereed articles on their topic.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Literature maps should clearly set out:</p>\n<p>1) overall topic for each paragraph/section</p>\n<p>2) additional notes for each section outlining:</p>\n<p>- Specific inclusions for the paragraph including key arguments, definitions for key terms/concepts, a summation of key literature or ideas from literature to be discussed, attention to major gaps in the literature, link back to main research focus/interest</p>\n<p>3) All of the above inclusions should include supporting references - please embed these throughout notes as in-text citations</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 </strong></p>\n<p>Students shall select one key scholarly article used in the above literature map and write a short review of the article. The paper will: identify 1. the problem statement; 2. the research question; and 3. the conclusions of the research. Crucially, the paper will (4) describe and critically evaluate the research methodology including a description and examination of the research method used (including theoretical position), participant pool, selection criteria, data collection methods, data analysis, and ethical considerations addressed. The assignment should demonstrate an ability to highlight the strengths and limitations of methodological choices made in the selected article and include supporting references from research methodology texts (such as the set texts).  The paper should be approx. 1,000 words in length. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Please note: any ideas which come from other work must be appropriately referenced. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.
