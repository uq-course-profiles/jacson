This will identify an issue or problem within the client organisation that the media plan is intended to address. The plan should outline a response to the issue or problem including research, objectives, tactics and evaluation using the BROPE model (see below). This will<strong> </strong>include the planning for your media assets (portfolio) (assignment 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong> In media work \"to be most effective, we need to have a plan\" (Johnston &amp; Rowney 2018, p. 109). You will use the ROPE process model from the text (chapter 5) and add a summary of the brief to it -- so it becomes BROPE. The planning process and document will be explained in the assignment task sheet on BB. Additional information is in chapter 5 and you should also be guided by the Golden Target campaigns worked on in tutorials (and available for review on BB). The brief and the plan will be discussed and workshopped in tutorials. Some referencing is required, using APA. </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.
