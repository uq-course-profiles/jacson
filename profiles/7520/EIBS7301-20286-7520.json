Students will be asked to form teams of a maximum of 6 students in Week 4 and choose one (1) emerging technological field. Teams should analyse their chosen technology from the viewpoint of a single firm.</p>\n<p>Student teams are expected to deliver one (1) presentation in the Week 11 or 12 seminar - (8-minute presentations + 5-minute Q&amp;A, depending on time). The structure of the presentation is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview of the technology</li>\n<li>Source and type of innovation</li>\n<li>The firm's technology strategy</li>\n<li>Market opportunities and risks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students should submit their PowerPoint presentation before the class they present it in. All students in team are expected to attend the presentation and be ready to field the questions posed by the teaching team and fellow students' questions after the presentation concludes.</p>\n<p>Each team member is expected to make an equal contribution to the project and the presentation. At the beginning of the project, the team is required to develop a Team Charter that specifies the technology that has been chosen and a clear division of the roles in the project. At the end of the presentation, all team members will be required to complete a peer assessment of each other's performance and contribution to the evaluation. Instructions for how to do this will be provided in class.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p>Students are welcome to use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the preliminary development of their presentations.
