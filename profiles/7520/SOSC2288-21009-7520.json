Table 3 in your Study Guide provides the marking criteria for this task. The Study Guide is available via the courses Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><em>Details:</em> This course will require attendance at weekly workshops throughout the semester. The workshops have a strong participative flavour and as such, there is some work to do to set up the environment each week to ensure people feel welcome, comfortable, and prepared to engage. Therefore, at the beginning of each workshop, a group of people will take responsibility for running a 5-10-minute warm-up activity. In other words, you are being asked to help build our classroom community.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The way this will work is as follows:</p>\n<p>1. At the first workshop, you will be assigned to a \"home group\" for the semester. </p>\n<p>2. There is a rolling assessment calendar which means that the home group to which you are assigned, will determine the timing of this AND your other pieces of assessment for the semester (see Blackboard for the assessment timetable).  Please note you will have the ability to negotiate your group membership in Week 1. (Students who miss the Week 1 course will be allocated to a group by the Course Coordinator). </p>\n<p>3. You will conduct a warm-up during the class. Please note that at 15 minutes the lecturer will interrupt you to begin the next activity, so plan your use of time carefully.</p>\n<p>4. You will submit a review of your warm-up facilitation by 2pm on the Thursday following your facilitation, through Turnitin.  Details of how to structure your review are provided in The Course Study Guide and on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong><em>* Marking criteria, additional resources and a list of Frequently Asked Questions about this assessment task will be available on Blackboard, under the Assessment folder. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):ﾠ</strong>Theﾠtasks in this course haveﾠbeen designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. ﾠWhilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.ﾠA failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.ﾠTo pass theﾠassessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In Assessment 2 you will be using the Outsider Witnessing technique to provide your reflections on the week’s workshop. You will share your contributions in class. You will have the discussion as a group, but you will receive individual marks. Different students will be scheduled to be Outsider Witnesses for different weeks, in a rolling timetable throughout the semester as per Table 6 of the Study Guide. Table 4 in your Study Guide provides the marking criteria for this task. The Study Guide is available via the courses Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><em>Details: </em>Outsider Witnessing is a process used in a range of dialogical practices, including narrative practice, and family counselling. It is a structured process that invites an audience to witness, and then acknowledge a story (or event) in a particular way. Unlike other forms of feedback or commentary in which applause is centred (e.g. “great work”, “good idea”), or an overly intellectual or critical stance is offered (e.g. “the limits of that analysis were...”), the aim of outsider witnessing is to assist the participant to understand the impact of their ideas and to extend the thinking and enquiry. This is done by exploring two paths, in turn, “curiosity and mystery”, and then “resonance and transport”. The way this will be done is to reflect on four distinctive questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What specific words or expressions caught your attention?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> You are being asked to recognise what touched or moved you in any way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What images emerged? </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are being asked to think about the images of community life, or the world more generally, that were evoked for you as you observed? Describe the image. Explain what you understood to be the purpose, hope, or values behind these images.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How do these connect to your own life?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also known as “embodying responses” this question asks what is it about your own life or work that caught your attention or struck a chord for you? What experiences have you had that connected to these ideas? What is it about your own life that meant you were touched in this way? Why do these elements resonate with your own life experiences?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In what ways have you been transported? </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final question asks how you have been moved - or transported - on account of this activity? Where has this experience taken you? How has hearing the story influenced your thinking?<strong> </strong>In what way have you become something other than who you were on account of witnessing or experiencing this activity? What actions will you take (no matter how small) as a result of witnessing this event/chapter/story?</p>\n<p><em>* These questions are very different from other reflective processes you may have been taught – and a list of Frequently Asked Questions about this assessment task, alongside additional resources, will be available on Blackboard, under the Assessment folder. We will also have opportunity to practice these ideas in class.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):ﾠ</strong>Theﾠtasks in this course haveﾠbeen designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. ﾠWhilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.ﾠA failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.ﾠTo pass theﾠassessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It asks you to select a particular developmental moment or challenge from your in-class facilitation, to focus on. This assessment piece will apply the SEAL method of reflection to identify a situation and interrogate your practice. The SEAL method consists of four steps:</p>\n<p>1.   SITUATION: Choose a specific moment from within your in-class facilitation session that challenged you, or provided a moment for personal growth, and explain what happened.</p>\n<p>2.   EFFECT: Explain the impact on you and how it made you feel.</p>\n<p>3.   ACTION: Describe the actions or strategies you took in response to the situation.</p>\n<p>4.   LEARNING: Explore what you learned from it in relation to community development, and the implications for your community development practice in the future.</p>\n<p>As you will see from the marking criteria, you are required to incorporate relevant theory to support your assignment.</p>\n<p>This task has been developed because the skills of observation and reflection are critical to community work. Being a good community worker means constantly reflecting on your practice and seeking ways to continually develop your skills. Doing something well doesn’t mean much if you don’t know why it worked and how you can replicate it. Doing something poorly isn’t a disaster if it provides a rich learning opportunity and leads to greater insight and improvements for next time. In putting your reflection together, you are being invited to hold your work both appreciatively and critically. Neither false modesty nor an over-inflated ego will be helpful to this exercise.</p>\n<p>Different students will be scheduled to conduct the facilitation task in different weeks, in a rolling timetable throughout the semester as per Table 6 of the Study Guide. Table 5 in your Study Guide provides the marking criteria for this task. The Study Guide is available via the courses Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><strong><em>* Marking criteria, additional resources and a list of Frequently Asked Questions about this assessment task will be available on Blackboard, under the Assessment folder. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):ﾠ</strong>Theﾠtasks in this course haveﾠbeen designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. ﾠWhilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.ﾠA failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.ﾠTo pass theﾠassessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

There are numerous traditions to draw upon here: theatre work is the most obvious, but art and dance and music are also rich in possibility. As always, the emphasis is upon using these mediums to move from individual concern to collective agendas.",
