This auto-ethnographic project enables students to pursue a project that fosters an understanding of how gender, culture, socio-economic status and developmental stages influence the capacity and motivations of individuals to participate in regular physical activity, and how that activity may influence growth and development. This project will provide a specific context to understand many of the physiological, psychological, social and environmental factors that influence participation and longevity to a physically active lifestyle.</p>\n<p><em>The auto-ethnography project</em></p>\n<p>An auto-ethnography should enable to reader to gain an understanding of the culture (how it works, what people wear, say and do, things to avoid [faux pas] etc.) such that the reader could enter the culture and be able to participate. It should also give the reader some idea of what it feels like to participate.</p>\n<p>For this assignment you should:</p>\n<p>• select a physical activity or sport with which you are <em>unfamiliar</em> as the focus for your study. <strong>In selecting a physical activity or sport, students are recommended to consider the safety aspects of that activity relative to their experience levels and to seek appropriate training or advice before starting.</strong></p>\n<p>• arrange to participate in the activity for a minimum of six (6) sessions over a 6-week period.</p>\n<p>• As a participant observer you should (with permission):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make field notes of your observations and experiences</li>\n<li>take some photos of the activity in context or locate other images</li>\n<li>interview some of the participants</li>\n<li>collect documents relevant to the activity context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The assessment</em></p>\n<p>You will submit a written report of your findings of no more than 2,000 words in length. This word length does not include references. The written piece will give an account of how the sub-culture of the activity works (the rules [explicit &amp; tacit], symbols, practices etc) and of your involvement. In discussing your reactions to your participation you should make reference to your own physical activity history to help contextualize why you reacted (emotionally, physically etc) as you did.
