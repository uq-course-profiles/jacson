You may wish to consider ways that you could have done things differently to expand or improve on the outcomes, processes, and achievements, or ways the organisation could improve methodology and management of future projects. In the essay, you might quote your own recorded comments/thoughts at particular times during the internship to underpin your reflection of your own and the organisation's work.

If you choose to cite secondary sources, you should include a Works Cited list in MLA style.</p>\n<p>As John Cowan suggests: </p>\n<p>Reflection is well established as an essential component of lifelong learning and professional development… It is taken here as thinking in which a learner identifies and seeks an answer to a question whose answer, preferably in generalised form, is likely to be of practical use to them. The learner deliberately thinks about past or impending actions, with a view to effecting future improvement… This process can take place within a written, keyed or narrated reflective journal and should lead to new understandings and appreciations. [...] Reflection begins from a question whose useful answer the person concerned desires to identify. It progresses into thinking whose focus relative to the activity from which it hopes to learn is determined by the timing of the chosen question. It should entail sustained questioning and especially self-questioning by any person who reflects privately.
