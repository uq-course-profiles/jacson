Possible public places include: Sports game, public garden or park, shopping mall, a Café, town square, or a bus stop...&amp; any other public place you choose.</li>\n<li><strong>Observe using all of your senses:</strong> take notes about visual, audio and olfactory (i.e. smell) aspects of your chosen field site. What are people doing in your setting? Spend your time writing as well as watching, trying to capture details such as snippets of conversation, details about people's dress or behaviour, how the place changes (in smell, busy-ness etc) across the course of the hour, and anything else that strikes you as interesting. Your notes will help you describe the place in a way that reflects an empirical truth (one based on the world you observed). </li>\n<li><strong>Take a photograph </strong>of the general setting but make sure this is not a close-up or easily identifiable photo of any individual person. </li>\n<li>Practice 'seeing' like an ethnographer. <strong>Use your notes to write a narrative description</strong> of the public place, it must be based on your description of the real and also seek to transport your reader into the setting.</li>\n<li><strong>Make reference to 1 relevant article in anthropology</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 500 word Observation-based short essay will not be your actual observation notes made during the observation. Rather, what you submit will be an organised form of your notes, written up as a descriptive narrative that also relates your observations to one article of your choosing from your reading in anthropology. [* For example, you may have chosen to observe a public garden, but what you observe there leads you to go looking for what anthropologists have written about social exclusion, human-plant interaction, human-animal interaction or some other phenomenon]. The essay could be structured under headings (such as visual, audio, olfactory), or not; it is your choice. You must try to be both detailed and succinct. <strong>To provide a good ethnographic description based on your observation, ask yourself</strong>, 'what is the significance of social behaviour in this public place?' OR 'What is the social meaning of this place and the behaviour in it?' How does the anthropology article you have chosen help you make sense of what you observed? We will prepare for the observation exercise during the tutorials. Your observation-based short essay must have a title, be clearly written and referenced (APA7). It must include a photograph which illustrates a key point that you make in your essay, but make sure this does not identify any individual person.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

It entails combining ethnographic interview data collection and research in the anthropological literature to write an essay, and is focussed on economics or politics. Each student will generate their own essay title and content based on original research (interview and associated data analysis) matched with research in the academic literature (anthropology articles, books, etc.).</p>\n<p>Step 1: Go back to the course material where we discussed economics and politics and consider the reading material. Make a decision to investigate EITHER economics or politics (see below). Step 2: Write some interview questions and undertake a short (roughly 30-60 min) interview with a friend or family member on the topic. Step 3: Collate the notes you took during the interview or make notes using the audio recording and/or transcript of your interview and analyse these, using the process of 'coding' (see online workshop 5). Then, using the keywords that arise ('codes') in the process of this coding, Step 3: engage in research in the anthropological literature to find anthropological papers which help you 'make sense' of and discuss the themes. The final essay you write will combine your data (from the interview) and the anthropological literature from the course outline and your research to help you make sense of what your interviewee tells you. The essay will include an appendix that provides a sample (no more than 2 pages) of your coded data ('Coded notes'). The Final Essay assessment (+ coded notes) must be submitted by Friday, Week 13 at 2 p.m.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Coded notes of interview: 10% (max two pages) </strong>The sample of Coded notes must be submitted at the same time as the essay (below) and in the same document. Students receive training on how to code their notes (see online workshop 5) and guidance in tutorials. Coded notes MUST include references to at least 3 relevant (anthropological) pieces of literature . Coded notes will be submitted via TurnitIn at the same time as the essay and in the same document.</li>\n<li><strong>Essay (max 1500 words): 30% </strong>All essays must include a title, your name, student number, page numbers, and be in Times New Roman 12 pt font. Essays must be properly referenced in Harvard style (see the following guide: https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/uqharvard), with at least 3<strong> anthropology sources.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Choose one of the two topics below. Re-consider the lecture and reading material from the course to help you decide the topic and think of a line of questioning. Follow the instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Topic 1: Economics </strong>Interview a close friend or relative about their ideas related to economics; trade, money, value, labour, or some other aspect of economic life. In the essay you will consider a broader question about socio-economic life, using the results of this interview. How does the data from the interview reflect/contrast with broader sociocultural and/or historical conditions or realities? Re-consider the lecture and relevant reading material from the course. Your essay must include a kinship diagram in which you 'map' any connections between members of the family to which your interviewee refers (for example, if you were interested in the lines of inheritance of material wealth, the values in a family business, or the labour choices among family members). Your essay must also reference at least 3 academic anthropological sources such as journal articles, book chapters, or books. The essay must <em>conclude with a question or tentative finding</em> about the economic matters you investigated. </p>\n<p><strong>Topic 2: Politics </strong>Interview a close friend or relative about political (or apolitical!) views, party membership, activism, experience of working in bureaucracy or some other aspect of political life. In the essay you will tell a story with the results of this interview. How does the data from the interview reflect/contrast with broader sociocultural and/or historical conditions or realities? Your essay must include a kinship diagram in which you 'map' the connections between any members of the family to which your interviewee refers (for example, if you were interested in political party membership, traditions of activism among family members, or opposing views within a family group). Your essay must also reference at least 3 academic anthropological sources such as journal articles, book chapters, or books. The essay must <em>conclude with a question or tentative finding</em> about the political matters you investigated. </p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
