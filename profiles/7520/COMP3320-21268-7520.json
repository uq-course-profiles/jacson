            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>The weekly practical work will involve tasks and exercises to be progressively assessed each week during the student's allocated practical session. Practical classes start in Week 3. Weekly attendance at your allocated practical session is mandatory. Missed sessions are calculated as zero marks for that session. <strong>Late addition of this course after Week 2 is not permitted.</strong> Every practical session develops new skills and assesses the application of the skills from the previous week's practical session. Thus, practical sessions are cumulative, each week building on the previous week. The first practical class in week 3 provides the formative learning that will be assessed the following week.</p>\n<p>The weekly practical reports must be submitted as part of the student’s allocated practical session - late submissions receive a 100% late penalty and no extensions are possible. Information required for your unique solution for the weekly assessments can only be obtained during your practical session. Target machines are only orchestrated for each hour of your scheduled lab session and are torn-down automatically and changed to accommodate the next session. You must select a single lab session that you can physically attend at the same time for the full 2 hours every week.</p>\n<p>The Week 3 assessment is formative (practice). All nine remaining practical sessions start with summative assessments of the previous week's practical skills.</p>\n<p>The practical sessions will be delivered in the Computer Labs in the General Purpose South building (78-116) or, for some weeks, in the UQ Cyber War Rooms on Level 4 of the General Purpose South building (78). Ensure you request practical sessions that you can physically attend the whole 2-hour session (all timetabling shows the location as 78-116). You may not attend another session that you are not allocated to. Lab sessions will be very full and the practical environments will be set up with the logins of the students allocated to each particular session in UQ's class allocation system.</p>\n<p>The course uses only Unix-based tools and does not use Microsoft Windows or other GUI-based systems. All practical assessments use a shell command line (see <strong>Assumed Background</strong>). The prerequisite assumed knowledge will not be re-taught in this course.</p>\n<p>Details of each weekly session's tasks and method for submission will be provided on the Lab Instructions each week (downloadable from Blackboard each week). There are no practical sessions in Week 1 or Week 8 (due to a public holiday affecting one of the classes in Week 8).</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
