The assignment is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the key concepts learned in the course combined with the real-world language issues or problems identified from your selected polity. You would be familiar with this assessment genre (essay), as this is one of the most traditional assessment activities. Note that you will have to put forward an original argument in your essay about the topic of your choice in relation to the polity. You will also make use of the concepts that you will have learned in the course. And you will use the relevant literature to support your argument. You will also address all assessment criteria.</p>\n<p>You will negotiate your topic for the essay with your lecturer/tutor. This should be seen as an intensive piece of writing that uses an LPP perspective discussed in the course and carefully follows good editorial practice. You will make sure that your essay does not contain avoidable language and style issues, and you are guided by APA7. This assessment task is an academic exercise, but it will include implications for language policy and planning.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Entities at sub-national levels also need language policies for their operation. Some of the common entities include schools, families, religious groups, and minority language groups in a majoritarian society.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this assessment task is to give you an opportunity to develop language policies for one of these local entities. You will develop a micro language policy for an organisation or institution (e.g., a bank, hospital, or a tourist resort) that is located in the polity of your choice. As part of policy development, you will need to identify language problems or language needs of the institution, develop policies that will address those problems or needs, and suggest implementation of the policies taking into account various resources.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is practical in nature (developing realistic language policies for actual institutions) but this has to be informed by theoretical knowledge and understanding. The course will provide discussion of micro-level policy and examples of such policies including processes and frameworks for policy development.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Students are required to choose a particular polity (e.g. Australia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and China) and talk about its language situation. However, they can't choose the polity that they are affiliated with. For example, a student from Indonesia cannot present the language situation in Indonesia. They will have to choose another polity. Taking an ecological view, they will describe the various languages and varieties and their current situation in the polity. This will call for taking a historical perspective. There are many examples of polity studies in the LPP literature.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The polity presentation will start from Week 6 (the week beginning on 1/4/2024) and students will be notified about their presentation dates by Week 4. Each student will have to select their polity and inform their tutor by Week 5. Each student will have 20 minutes for the individual presentation.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Most of the In Person students will make their presentation face-to-face in during the tutorial class. However, some students will be allowed to video record their presentation and submit it through the blackboard since not all students can be accommodated in the face-to-face presentation schedule. The modes of the presentations will be negotiated by the tutor with the students. Clear instructions will be provided about how to upload recorded presentations to the course blackboard. The presenter must be visible in their recorded presentation.</p>\n<p>Students should note that the polity selection is crucial for them, as they will have to do all three assessment tasks related to the same polity of their choice. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
