The mechanisms of colonial economic and political domination are explored this week in a case study of Indonesia (Hägerdal, 2020; Ricklefs, 1981). The drive for profit, goods, markets and labour shapes the aims of the Dutch East Indies company (and the Dutch state) in their colonisation of Indonesia but these processes and their outcomes change with different forms of colonialism from 1500 to 1900 (Booth, 1998; Phillips &amp; Sharman, 2020).
