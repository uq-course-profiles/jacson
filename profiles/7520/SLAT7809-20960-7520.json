It also gives students the opportunity to interpret classroom discourse and reflect on group processes from a sociocultural perspective. Your group will be given a topic, based on one of the weekly lecture topics. Drawing on an article in the current research literature, you will introduce one or two relevant SCT concepts to the other members of the class.</p>\n<p><strong>The Workshop:</strong></p>\n<p>With the class, you will briefly explore and explain how your chosen task is theorised to support language learning from a sociocultural perspective. The aim of this task is to give your audience practical experience of one (1) classroom task used in SCT research. In other words you will 'partially duplicate' the research in the chosen article, meaning you will redevelop the classroom task from that article and have students in the class perform a short version of that task (5-8 minutes). </p>\n<p>In your workshop you will do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Briefly describe the research article, concept(s), and task chosen;</li>\n<li>Introduce the task, explaining how it was used to address one of the research questions in the article;</li>\n<li>Have the students perform the task (SCT tasks often involve pair or group interaction);</li>\n<li>Monitor the task-based activity, and attempt to interpret the interaction according to the chosen research question</li>\n<li>Present a brief comparison of the findings from the research article with your observations of the task-based activity in your workshop;</li>\n<li>Invite and answer questions and comments from your workshop participants.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The workshop will be supported by a Powerpoint file and a short introductory video, which must be submitted to the lecturer prior to the presentation. The workshop may be video-recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
