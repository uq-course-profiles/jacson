A list of suggested topics covered by previous students is provided on Blackboard. Once you have chosen your topic, research it, write, record, edit and produce a <strong>6-8 minute podcast</strong> aimed at a general audience with a specialist interest in your topic. That is, this is not an 'academic' project per se, but one aimed at an audience of like-minded peers.</p>\n<p>Podcast scripts should be formatted in 12pt Times New Roman, double-spaced.</p>\n<p><strong>An information sheet in the Assessments folder on Blackboard </strong>contains all details on how to upload the podcast file via Soundcloud. The script should be submitted via Turnitin on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Your podcast should consist of original material, created by you. You are encouraged to include original interview segments/Q&amp;As/chat with experts or laypeople. Music or audio must be from creative commons or copyright-free sites. Externally derived content should be used only if it is integral to your argument/narrative and used sparingly – this means any excerpts from existing online interviews/chat/quotes/news reports/broadcasts etc that you did not develop yourself (max 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>You can use any software that you are familiar with to create your podcast. However, the UQ Media and Production Services team (MaPS) only supports Adobe Audition.
