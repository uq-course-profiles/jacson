The new staff have just completed undergraduate degrees in Pharmaceutical Science and/or Pharmacy. The workshop is designed to inform new staff about some of the new methods your company is using or is considering using in their drug discovery and development programs. You are asked to <strong>present a digital poster presentation of no more than 4 minutes</strong> (<strong>you will be stopped at 4 minutes</strong>), the presentation should provide a basic overview of the method/approach that is assigned to you.</li>\n<li>The method/approach will be assigned in week 1.</li>\n<li>Your presentation should focus on how the approach/method can be used in pharmaceutical discovery and development. You will be <strong>asked a series of questions for 5 minutes</strong> after your presentation. Questions will be mostly general since the presentation is to an audience who are not experts in the topic. The audience may also ask you to explain specific aspects in more detail.</li>\n<li>Students should attend the session in which they are presenting (~ 8-10 talks per session).</li>\n<li>The Oral Presentation will be recorded and retained as per university policy. The recording will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed if required for the purposes of moderation of marking; provision of feedback to the student; and/or re-marking following a successful re-mark application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Every student must submit a PDF document</strong> containing their poster, a page of consistent references (Vancouver style) and a copy of their student ID card to the assessor via the Learn.UQ Poster Presentation assessment link prior to the commencement of their poster presentation session.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal enrolled students</strong> will give their presentation to their assessor and other students in person (room details provided on the course Learn.UQ site). Please arrive early to upload your presentations (from USB type A flash drive) to the lectern computer. In the event that in person presentations cannot occur, the presentations will be given over Zoom.</p>\n<p><strong>External enrolled students </strong>will give their presentations via Zoom. Zoom link details will be advised on Learn.UQ.</p>\n<p><strong>Poster Style:</strong></p>\n<p>Your digital poster should be presented as a <strong>SINGLE 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio PowerPoint slide</strong> for projection or screen sharing. Students should bring their PowerPoint compatible slide on a USB flash drive if presenting in the lecture theatre, or be prepared to present via Zoom (using share screen) if presenting online. The SINGLE slide must contain no movies, transitions or animations (i.e. the slide must be static).</p>\n<p>Requirements for the posters are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poster must contain a clear title.</li>\n<li>The bottom left-hand corner of your poster must contain your name.</li>\n<li>The use of tables, diagrams and/or images to explain concepts is strongly encouraged. </li>\n<li>The use of bullet point text is also strongly encouraged.</li>\n<li>Font size, style, colour, background colour and images should allow for clear reading of the poster when presented. The font sizes used in the example poster on the PHIP7121 UQ Extend site are appropriate and should be used as a guide. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The marking criteria is available on the assessment page on the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An example poster with an example presentation is available on the UQ Extend site. </li>\n<li>Consult the marking criteria and the example poster provided before designing your poster and preparing your speech.</li>\n<li>Rehearse with your friends and seek feedback for improvement.</li>\n<li>Record yourself practicing your presentation using Zoom, and watch the recording back to experience what your assessor and colleagues will experience.</li>\n<li>If presenting via Zoom, ensure that you are in a location with a reliable internet connection on the presentation day, and that you are familiar with using Zoom, including setting up your microphone, webcam, and sharing your computer screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marking: </strong>The marking rubric is available on the PHIP7121 Learn.UQ site under assessments.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Generative AI and Machine Translation (MT): </em></strong><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Use material from UQ Extend, your observations in the formulation development activity and other sources to reflect on \"why is research important in the pharmaceutical industry and why can it sometimes be challenging?\"</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 –</strong> What type of formulation is the topic of this essay?</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3 –</strong> Which dosage form design concept or feature did you select?</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4 –</strong> Provide a definition or description (in your own words) of the dosage form design concept or feature you have selected (150 words or less, no more than two figures).</p>\n<p><strong>Part 5 –</strong> Explain the significance of this dosage form design concept or feature, in theory, with respect to the practical application of the formulated product (300 words or less, no more than two figures and/or/photos). For example, for tablets and the concept of 'friability' - <em>Tablets that have high friability are more likely to break into smaller pieces during transport.</em> <em>This could lead to</em> <em>the patient being unable to use the product (the tablet is broken into many parts making it impossible to use), a smaller dose administered than the stated dose of the tablet (if a section of the tablet has broken off and the patient still uses the product) or</em> <em>altered tablet disintegration ……..</em></p>\n<p><strong>Part 6 –</strong> Using observations made during the formulation development (lab sessions) describe how this dosage form design concept influenced your approach and consequently the final product (600 words or less, no more than four figures and/or photos and/or screen shots). For example, for tablets and the concept of 'friability' - <em>Many of the first formulations exhibited high friability as demonstrated by ……… Hence we attempted to reduce friability through the addition of ………………. This agent acts via ……… The reduced friability of our final product was indicated by ………..</em></p>\n<p><strong>Marking: </strong>The marking rubric is available on the PHIP7121 Learn.UQ site under assessments. This assessment task will be analysed by TurnItIn software for similarity to other documents and assessment submissions and for signs that generative AI or contract cheating services were utilised. Students should ensure that the assessment does not directly copy or paraphrase written material from other sources and that content is appropriately referenced.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Generative AI and Machine Translation (MT): </em></strong><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) technologies, successful completion of the assessment will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which AI will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
