This should be produced utlising the videoing facilities within the UQ Psychology Clinic consult rooms (more details on how to book these rooms to be discussed in class). The aims of this exercise are: to demonstrate your ability in using microskills, to demonstrate your ability in conducting a brief intake interview, and to assist you in building self-reflection skills. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In the recorded session, you are to follow an intake procedure (welcome the client, discuss limitations of confidentiality, and enquire about why they have presented for help). You will then clarify what the presenting problem(s) is/are and why the presenting problem(s) is/are an issue at this point in time (the video should be between 15 and 20 minutes long). You should end the session with a summary of the presenting problem(s). You will then view your video and assess your own performance. You will need to complete the self-evaluation Interview Checklist (available on the Blackboard site). And then use the checklist as the basis upon which to prepare a written critique of your video (1-2 pages max., APA 7th formatting as appropriate) – identifying any strengths and areas for further development, as well as any aspect(s) you found challenging. Be specific as to what you did well and where you could improve your interviewing skills (with some suggestions on what you can do to achieve this). You will also be asked to provide a dot point summary of the feedback (strengths and areas for further development) provided by your peer (no more than 1 page). Finally, and in consideration of the \"Indigenous Clinical Psychology in Australia: A Decolonising Social-Emotional Well-Being Approach\" chapter (available on Blackboard), offer a reflection as to how you might change aspects of your role play to appropriately incorporate elements of the social-emotional well-being model based on the presenting problem.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
