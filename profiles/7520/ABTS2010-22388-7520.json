First, you are required to choose an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander woman and create a draft Wikipedia entry as a poster. The aim is to increase the representation of Indigenous women on Wikipedia. Choose a woman who is not already on Wikipedia. We will have time in class to discuss your selection. Follow the Wikipedia manual of style to write your 1000-word entry and create it in poster format. In your draft Wikipedia entry, include discussion about one or more of the woman's key works or contributions to their field (e.g. an artwork, literary work or scholarly contribution). Next, you are also required to submit an AI generated Wikipedia entry about the Indigenous women you have selected. Compare and contrast the difference between the AI generated Wikipedia entry against your research informed Wikipedia entry. Include a 300-word summary outlining the differences and similarities between the two Wikipedia entries and an overview about the pros and cons of the AI generated Wikipedia entry. Ensure that you have also included the AI generative Wikipedia entry.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The purpose of this task is to deepen your engagement with the work of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, as well as to practice your critical reflection, writing and use of AI critically. You will be given guidance on this in the semester. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Length: 1000 words Wikipedia Poster and 300-word summary outlining the differences, similarities and pros and cons of using AI (note the AI generated Wikipedia entry does not count towards the word limit).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><em>Note: For the next assessment, you are required to present your draft Wikipedia page to the class, including a discussion about the woman you chose. You are strongly encouraged to look ahead at the requirements and criteria for the presentation, to support your planning and decision-making for the Wikipedia entry.</em></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of artificial intelligence (AI)</strong></p>\n<p>While students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
