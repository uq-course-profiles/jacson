An infographic is a visual representation of an idea or data, and yours should be succinct, entertaining and eye-catching. Your analysis and recommendations should be well-supported by academic research, with in-text citations and a reference list (an additional page attached to the Infographic) formatted according to APA Referencing Guidelines. A minimum of 6 references is required. You should incorporate informative text and engaging images or graphics to appeal and explain your findings to your audiences. </p>\n<p>Your infographic should address the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief overview of the event (experiences/programs, target segments, market positioning, etc)</li>\n<li>Identification of the event's sponsorship assets and their value to sponsors</li>\n<li>A detailed evaluation of the event's sponsorship program, event-sponsor fit, and sponsorship portfolio</li>\n<li>Discussion of the strategic implications of the current sponsorship plan based on your evaluation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your infographic should be concise, clearly argued, and creatively crafted.

Develop a sponsorship proposal that you would use to target ONE sponsor you have identified as a possible target for your event. The sponsorship proposal must be developed for a<em> potential/new sponsor</em>. The proposal will be presented in a 12-15-minutes recorded presentation (max. 15 min), using PowerPoint slides with narration. The presentation should involve the development of a full sponsorship proposal pitch that is concise, persuasive, and professionally articulated. Scholarly, as well as industry evidence, will be integral to performance.</p>\n<p>When preparing the sponsorship proposal pitch, ask yourself - If I was the sponsor, would I invest in this event?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the organisation being asked to sponsor?</li>\n<li>What will the organisation receive for its sponsorship?</li>\n<li>How can the sponsorship be leveraged?</li>\n<li>What is it going to cost?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be as creative as you like. You might want to create a themed proposal to reflect your event’s personality/concept. However, be sure to address the following aspects of the sponsorship proposal in your presentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brief introduction</li>\n<li>Description of the event (be sure to highlight the event's programs, unique selling propositions, and success to date)</li>\n<li>The audience profile (e.g., demographics, purchasing behaviour, geographic locations, and/or attendance patterns). Note: This information should be based on logic and research, but can also be partly hypothetical.</li>\n<li>The opportunity for this sponsor (e.g., event-sponsor compatibility)</li>\n<li>An overview of sponsorship package: potential benefits, rights, status, value-adding, etc. </li>\n<li>Outline of supporting marketing plan/sponsorship servicing/leveraging that could be included in the sponsorship package for this sponsor</li>\n<li>Sponsorship investment ($ value or in-kind) and duration of the agreement</li>\n<li>Concluding notes - Call for action/interest with reference to further contact/discussions</li>\n<li>References - APA (7th edition) is required for all the assessment items in this course. For guidance please refer to UQ library website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SUBMISSION FORMAT:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This assignment does not require a face-to-face presentation. Instead, you will create a 12-15 minutes (maximum 15 minutes) PowerPoint slide show with narration (as you would present it to a 'live' audience). If you are unfamiliar with recording a slide show with narration, click <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/learnuq-blackboard-help/kaltura-media/kaltura-capture-voice-over-presentation\">HERE</a>.

While you may want to submit a video file recording your presentation slides and narration, uploading a video file to Blackboard tends to take longer and results in submission failure.
