Tutorial Discussion Questions: Judith Walkowitz, “Science and the Séance: Transgressions of Gender and Genre” (1992), in Houses of History , 301–319. What does Walkowitz mean when she says that the medical men and spiritualists “engaged in a symbolic struggle, in a dialectical battle of words and images, often inverting the same metaphoric language as their opponents”? How did the Victorian séance reverse “the usual sexual hierarchy of knowledge and power”? In what ways were female mediums in danger? What are some of the ways that Georgina Weldon manipulated discourses of gender and genre to “triumph over her enemies”? How does this reflect a poststructural history?",
