Political scientists will typically acknowledge that each of these approaches has merit, and that a combination of approaches may be needed to explain political behaviour adequately. However, in practice research is often narrowly focused on one of these explanations, and over-reliant on one forms of evidence-gathering (e.g., opinion polls to gauge individual differences in political attitudes). The lecture will conclude with a brief review of research raising these challenges and suggesting ways in which perspectives can be combined.",
