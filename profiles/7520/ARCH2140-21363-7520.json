Experiencing built spaces by walking through them is a practice for producing spatial knowledge. It involves immersing oneself in built spaces while remaining alert and receptive to specific characteristics, shapes, symbols, streets, buildings, movement, infrastructure, events, people, interactions, happenings, and encounters. These are comprehended through ones’ senses (audio, visual, olfactory, and tactile) and recorded via maps, sketches, collages, diagrams, photographs, videos, texts, and narratives. Groups of 5 students will be like detectives and walk to discover other/creative/subversive uses of spaces besides the predefined and functional ones. Select a familiar starting point (e.g., university) to a part of the city/suburb that interests you.</p>\n<p>Student groups will prepare a presentation - 2:00 minutes (max) video that expresses the complexity experienced during the walk, students will make critical connections to issues related to ‘Architecture in Society’ and sustainable Development Goals (SDG): sheltering, vernacular architecture, indigenous architecture, informal settlements, displacement and post-disaster shelter, humanitarian architecture, refugees, public/social/ housing, affordable housing, suburbia, spatial justice and exclusion, power and identity, and agency and belonging. Each group will have a total of 8 minutes to present and receive feedback from tutor and peers. Group work will be assessed on the ability to critically observe, record, document and present observations creatively employing maps, sketches, collages, diagrams, photographs, videos, texts, and narratives, and including diverse perspectives of all group members.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment tasks prohibiting use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
