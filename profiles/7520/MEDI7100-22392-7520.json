The group project discussions and presentations will help to refine and clarify your understanding and expose you to alternative perspectives, fostering critical thinking and teamwork skills as you exchange, negotiate, and evaluate information with your peers. These learning processes are well supported by the educational literature.</p>\n<p>Collaborative group work among peers offers various benefits for learners, such as positively impacting students' understanding, sense of belonging, professional identity, and academic performance. Social interaction in learning tasks, presenting information in a clear way and relating it to other students, and using conceptually demanding learning tasks have a strong correlation to achievement.</p>\n<p>Each IGP has two sets of learning outcomes: <strong>generic</strong> and <strong>focus learning outcomes</strong>. Generic learning outcomes are outcomes that are common to all IGP1 projects.
