This involves presentations by people affected by mental disorders who provide a personal account of their lived experience of mental health difficulties either directly as someone who has a mental disorder, or as a carer of someone with a mental disorder, or as a health professional working with people with mental disorders. Additional videos/written cases of individuals with mental disorders are also shown and you may also write a reflective summary on one or more of these.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Choose five of these presentations/cases/videos and write a 200-300 word reflective summary on each one and submit via Turnitin before 2pm on the Wednesday one week later.

Each week, there will be a case study featuring the diagnosis from that week’s lecture, and you will be asked to work through a specific online module (taking about 15 minutes) and respond to questions about how you would apply the knowledge and skills from the module to provide peer support for the person in the case study. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Choose five of the modules and write a 200-300 word reflective summary on each one and submit via Turnitin before 2pm on the Wednesday one week later.
