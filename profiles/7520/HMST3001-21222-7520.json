During your reflections you are required to ‘self-assess’ and provide a rating of your performance, graded on a Likert scale (‘Not Meeting Expectations’, ‘On Track to Meet Expectations’, ‘Meeting Expectations’, and ‘Exceeds Expectations’). Your reflections are based on the following eight Professional Attributes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Professional conduct</li>\n<li>Client interaction/rapport (Client facing skills)</li>\n<li>Collaborative practice</li>\n<li>Communication</li>\n<li>Awareness of limitations and work-readiness</li>\n<li>Exercise prescription</li>\n<li>Exercise assessment, and</li>\n<li>Exercise delivery</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following this, student practitioners are required to develop three ‘SMART’ learning goals appropriate to their placement. These SMART goals will be tracked throughout your placement with your clinical educator often returning to these goals during your professional attribute’s intermediate assessment and your professional attributes final assessment.</p>\n<p>You are encouraged to develop your critical reflective ability through this task. To support your self-assessment, your clinical educator will encourage deeper reflection on a range of professional attributes by providing excerpts derived from your logbook entries. Using these excerpts, questions will be posed to you to assist you in deeper exploration of the selected professional attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

These are events or ‘light bulb moments’ which occurred during (or as a result of) your clinical development and have impacted you in an important (critical) way. A total of two written reflections need to be submitted throughout HMST3001 (upon the accrual of 60 and 100 placement hours, respectively). They should provide insight into how your professional skills and attributes improve, the challenges you overcome and identify, and the new training methods you’ve added to your professional ‘toolbox’.
