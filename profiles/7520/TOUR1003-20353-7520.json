In the majority of instances this evidence will be photographs you take at the site. Where this is not possible you can provide alternative supporting evidence (eg. publicly available annual reports).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: some types of impacts may be more prominent in some sites than others. For example, Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) may feature impacts on the natural environment; Star Casino Brisbane may feature impacts on the built environment; Suncorp Stadium may focus on economic impacts. Therefore, there may not be an equal number of impacts for each type of impact.
