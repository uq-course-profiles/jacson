An important skill for an organisational psychologist, or those applying psychological science in business contexts, is to be able to integrate the various insights that they gain from multiple sources to inform their theoretical approach and how they act in the world of work. You will submit one written review for the readings in week 8 (Diversity and Inclusion) and the second can be on a week of your choosing. On that week, as well as submitting your written review, you will also facilitate that week's class discussion. In addition, you will participate in weekly discussions in eight of the 12 weeks of the course.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
