Your arguments will be unsupported and/or inappropriate, your organisation and writing will be poor and/or inappropriate, and referencing and use of discipline conventions poor/and or inconsistent. Alternatively, your essay may suggest developing or higher achievement but (whether actually developed with the help of AI or not) will (a) exhibit the stereotypical and/or superficial understanding that is characteristic of generative AI text and/or (b) may fail to develop, in a way that is characteristic of generative AI text, a sustained (multi-layered) argument: <em>This grade is assigned for a total (sum of all the assessment components) in the range 25-44%.
