To obtain a pass (and be awarded a credit) you need to</p>\n<p>   •   show evidence that you have attempted to understand the assigned reading (your answers don't need to be 100% correct)</p>\n<p>   •   answer the questions in your own words (answers copied or paraphrased from the textbook and elsewhere will result in a fail for that quiz)</p>\n<p>   •   if one question is not answered, or the answer is not relevant, there will be no mark for that quiz.</p>\n<p>   •   (for the learning reflection question) show evidence that you have evaluated your own learning e.g., through highlighting any 'breakthroughs' in your understanding, relating what you have learned to other topics or experiences, or identifying questions and issues that you do not yet fully understand.</p>\n<p>Note: It is more important that your answers are a genuine reflection of your understanding, rather than being 100% correct!</p>\n<p>You automatically get 1 mark for the reading quiz in Week 1 of the teaching semester. Week 1 is the time to sort out the technology / your workflow.
