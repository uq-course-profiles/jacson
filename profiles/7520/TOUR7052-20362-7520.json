You will work as part of a <strong>team of four to six students</strong> to create and manage a virtual airline.</p>\n<p>Your team’s performance will be assessed at three stages of the simulation. Before the simulation, your team will present a <strong>Video Proposal </strong>(25%) for your airline (Week 6). During the simulation, your team will prepare an <strong>Annual Report</strong> (25%) reflecting on the performance of your airline in its <strong>first year</strong> of operation (Week 10). At the conclusion of the simulation, the performance of your airline will be evaluated by teaching staff using metrics produced by the simulation. For this <strong>Performance Evaluation </strong>(10%), your team will be asked to nominate the six metrics best aligned with your company's goals from a list of 12 metrics. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airline Proposal - 25% 5-6 minute video presentation</li>\n<li>Annual Report - 25% 10-12 pages</li>\n<li>Final Airline Performance - 10% - Teams to nominate 6 metrics by end of week 12 (no submission required)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While simulation assessments will be completed as a group, you will receive individual marks. Your <strong>individual marks</strong> for these tasks will be weighted based on a <strong>peer evaluation</strong> of your contribution to the team. The peer evaluation will be conducted online in Week 13 (by Friday, 5pm) after the simulation has finished. You will be asked to evaluate your own performance and the performance of each of your team members along five dimensions (contribution, quality, attendance, timeliness and overall performance). More details about how this peer evaluation will be calculated in available in the assessment guidelines on the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>You should aim to spend about <strong>4-5 hours</strong> of individual or teamwork time per week on this assessment task. This assessment requires students to work in teams; teamwork is a transferable skill that is highly valued in industry. This set of assessments also builds your employability by providing an opportunity to access knowledge, think critically and solve problems in a competitive environment. More information about this assessment will be provided in class and on the BlackBoard course website. </p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
