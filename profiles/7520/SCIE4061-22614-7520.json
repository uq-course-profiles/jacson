This document should include the current understanding of the field of the research based on published literature, and the relationship of this proposal to work in the field. Make sure that you cite the literature appropriately. Detail the significance of the research and describe how the project’s aims and anticipated outcomes advance the knowledge of the discipline. The length of this document would vary based on your disciplines but 10-15 pages would be a general guide.
