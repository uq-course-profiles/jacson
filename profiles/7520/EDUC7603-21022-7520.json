How do you think these characteristics have combined to impact on student learning? </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Carefully think about these points in your critical review paper:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Think about the contemporary issues that influence learning in education. </li>\n<li>Using literature that highlights recent advances in our understanding of learning, make sure you provide a critical analysis of the physical, social, emotional and intellectual characteristics of students. This means using the readings we provide and the discussions in the workshops and finding peer-reviewed literature to support any substantial claims you make about these aspects of learning.</li>\n<li>Consider how students actually learn, what do the theories on learning and development suggest? Consideration must be given to the implications of this for teaching practice. </li>\n<li>Your submission will need to include a discussion of research and theory but also provide concrete examples. These examples should illustrate your point in a way that a non-expert (such as student parents) could understand. </li>\n<li>It is mandatory that you draw on the material provided to you and the discussions that occur in the workshops. </li>\n<li>If you use generative AI in any way in your assessment task, you must provide specific details about how it was used and include all your prompts and outputs in an appendix. You must provide a response to this task that significantly advances or otherwise is predominantly generated by you and not by AI. Using generative AI without acknowledgement will be considered academic misconduct. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Important points</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your submission must include references including and not limited to those that have been provided to you. You must reference any and all ideas you have taken from somewhere else. </li>\n<li>All referencing must be done in APA format (version 7). Find and use a template to ensure that you are complying with APA format. </li>\n<li>Ensure that your submission includes a title page with your details and the details of the assessment task.</li>\n<li>The word limit is a broad guide only but please try to keep your submission to about 2000 words excluding references and any appendices. </li>\n<li>You may use the 2000 words in any way you see fit. It is logical to write this assignment up in something akin to an essay format. Please refer to the resources available at the UQ Library if you are unsure about how to write an essay. </li>\n<li>The discussions in the workshops are critical to providing you with opportunities to understand how to write a passable submission for this assessment task. </li>\n<li>Your submission will be checked for plagiarism and all applications for late submission will be treated in strict accordance with UQ policy.

In particular, this section will need to include details about how you will be meeting the below APSTs and the overall outcomes of the course. For example, you will demonstrate that you have included a range of teaching strategies (APST 3.3) and you will need to “demonstrate critical reflection on research into contemporary theories of learning and the mind, and implications for teaching” (course learning outcome).</li>\n<li>A summary showing very clearly how research and theory has informed your overall lesson plan(s). </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 3: Interactive oral</strong> <strong>(~1000 words equivalent) – 40%</strong></p>\n<p>Part 3 of your submission will involve an individual 1 on 1 discussion with a member of the teaching team. This discussion will be 10 minutes long. In it, you will be asked about your lesson plan and your justification for why you have designed it in the way you have.
