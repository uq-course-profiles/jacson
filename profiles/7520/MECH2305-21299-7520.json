            "topic_description": "CAD and CAM Sessions Students will be required to attend computer laboratory sessions throughout semester where they will engage in a number of active learning Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing exercises. In these sessions students will work with each other and course staff to first complete the introductory software training including applying these CAD skills in the production of simple models and assemblies through a series of practical tasks. Senior staff will review each studentﾒs performance on these practical tasks at key assessment milestones throughout the semester and award marks for satisfactory completion of tasks in the areas of 2D and 3D modelling, assembly and tool path generation for CNC machining. The CAD sessions are an adjunct to lecture demonstrations of software use and provide a hands-on active learning experience. Details about the assessment items and due dates will be announced in the Week 1 lectures.
