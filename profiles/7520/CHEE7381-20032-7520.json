To assist you in undertaking the thesis you should have regular, scheduled meetings with your supervisor. These meetings will provide you with advice and feedback on your progress. To efficiently use the time during the meetings, it`s highly recommended that the students bring an agenda with specific questions of the project, takes notes and develop clear actions lists for project execution. </p>\n<p>The assessment by your supervisor will partly be based on your progress through the year as monitored through these meetings. Lack of communication with your supervisor may lead to a low mark regardless of the quality of the Final Report submission.</p>\n<p>Make sure your peruse the marking sheet early in the project so you know what you are being assessed against.</p>\n<p>The following is a suggested guide to this assessment:</p>\n<p>1. Self Appraisal - It is encouraged that students make a 'self-assessment' at the end of term, using the same marking sheet, and provide this to their supervisor. </p>\n<p>2. The student and supervisor discuss the students self-appraisal and overall progress, and consider ways-of-working in the next term. </p>\n<p>3. The supervisor submits<strong> their own </strong>assessment to the course coordinator (usually during the 2nd week of exam period).</p>\n<p><strong>I encourage this process to be followed and that the final assessment is discussed with the student, but this is at the supervisors' discretion. </strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
