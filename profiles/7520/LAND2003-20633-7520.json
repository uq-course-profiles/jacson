Under the supervision, the students will determine basic soil properties: colour, texture, pH, EC and aggregate stability (LO: 1,2 ).</p>\n<p>Practical 2: Characterising soil profiles</p>\n<p>The practical 2 is held in field conditions (Pinjarra Hills and/or Gatton) where students will be exposed to intact soil profile in its natural surroundings. Students will be introduced to the field methods of soil profile description and classification. This includes assessment of basic soil properties, particular soil constraints and potential land use (LO: 2, 3, 4).</p>\n<p>Practical 3: Soil physical properties</p>\n<p>The practical 3 is held in laboratory settings where students will be introduced to basic soil physical properties and appropriate methods to evaluated them on a set of prepared soil samples. Under the supervision, the students will determine basic soil physical properties, i.e., bulk density, soil water contents, and porosity (LO: 2, 3, 4).</p>\n<p>Practical 4: Soil respiration</p>\n<p>The practical 4 is held in laboratory settings where students will be introduced to basic soil biological properties and appropriate methods to evaluated them on a set of prepared soil samples. Under the supervision, the students will determine soil respiration and environmental conditions that may affect it i.e., water content, temperature and additional nutrient source.</p>\n<p>Details about Practicals will be provided within Practical Manuals, which will be made available on Blackboard site before the scheduled practical, with additional specifics about report preparation and report submission (LO: 1, 2, 4).</p>\n<p>Practical classes are designed to provide further learning on the material covered in lectures, provide students with practical experience (laboratory and field), receive training on key soil assessment techniques/procedures, and give insight on the appropriated scientific methods. Students will be guided through the basis, design, and analysis of experiments. By engaging and participating in the practical sessions, students will be able to answer questions and prepare major portion of the practical report.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
