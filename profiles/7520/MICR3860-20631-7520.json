Where applicable, students should aim to have at least 4 key points per section. Referencing all literature resources used for the poster is required. The posters should be A0 in size and clearly and logically set out and should be readable from a distance of 1 to 1.5m. During the face-to-face class the course coordinator will be available to answer questions and guide your group. </p>\n<p>All posters will then be presented by the groups at a 'mini-conference' during the tutorial class (location will be advised). Attendance by all members at the Poster session is compulsory. Questions will be asked by the course coordinator and teaching support staff to clarify points and to test understanding.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
