The marks will be allocated according to the tasks as outlined in the assignment, and students will be evaluated based on their ability to comprehend and solve the given statistics and probability problems using Data Analysis tools learnt in the course. The group project will involve a prediction problem -- the group(s) with the best set of predictions can earn up to 5% bonus marks towards their final mark.</p>\n<p>The Scientific Data analysis assignment is a <strong>group </strong>work, and students must form their own group of <strong>5 team members (using Blackboard) by the end of week 5,</strong> or otherwise, they will be allocated to a group 'randomly'. Groups with fewer than FIVE members will not be permitted, and students not in a group of five by Week 5 will be placed into a group by the course coordinator. So, if you want to be in charge of who is in your group it is highly recommended you form a group of five. The composition of the group shall remain unchanged after Week 5 unless students are added/dropped by the course coordinator to ensure all students are in a group.</p>\n<p>The team submission marks for the Group Project assessment item of the course will be influenced by peer review; this peer weighting can cause your final mark to be elevated or demoted such that you receive a different grade to the rest of your team. Individual peer assessment forms will be submitted electronically to each team member in week 13; these forms require you to assign marks to each of your team members and to indicate how you rate your own input. You are also asked for a justification for your distribution of marks. The peer weighting factor will be calculated as an average of the scores assigned to each student - this factor will be directly applied to the team mark for the Group Project assignment. </p>\n<p>If your mark assignations are significantly different from that of the rest of the team and are not sufficiently supported by the comments of yourself and the team, the coordinator may remove your peer assessment from the final calculation of the peer weighting factors.</p>\n<p>Should the forms from your team indicate a large discrepancy between allocated marks, your team will be called in for discussion (and resolution) of issues within the team. If an agreement cannot be reached, the peer weighting will be devised by the coordinator on observations made during the course of the subject.</p>\n<p>Peer assessment factor (PAFs) are capped at 1.1 which means that you can potentially receive an additional 10% of the team marks but that no student will be overly rewarded for effort in place of marks for the other learning objectives. PAFs will be directly applied to the team component of the Project report marks (e.g. if you receive a PAF of 0.8, you will get 80% of the team mark component). <strong>There is no MINIMUM PAF.</strong></p>\n<p>The Course Coordinator will moderate the peer assessment factor (PAF) to ensure that the marks are indicative of your performance; overestimation of your own contribution and/ or clique-type assessment (where individuals are unfairly penalised or rewarded) will be removed. The Course Coordinator may seek the input of Academics and Tutors to this moderation process as required. The PAF will be due on 30/05/2025.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
