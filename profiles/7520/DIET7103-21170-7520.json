You will be required to do the following: </p>\n<p>Please choose a particular interviewing skill or counselling technique to demonstrate BRIEFLY in a video recording. Please select ONE technique or skill to demonstrate from one of the key phases of the interviewing and counselling framework which underpins this course (involving, exploration, resolving, closing). Skills you may choose to demonstrate include (but are not limited to): dietary interview, motivational interviewing (e.g. elicit-provide-elicit and/or OARS), goal setting, tailoring an intervention, reviewing ambivalence, providing nonjudgmental feedback, sharing a diet-disease relationship.</p>\n<p>You do not need to have mastered this skill – it is expected that you will all still be developing your skills in all areas, so perfection is not required or encouraged. This is a developmental exercise, so the more true critiques you can make, the more you will learn. Please refrain from creating a very poor video with “staged” poor performance to critique. This is not the purpose of the task and will result in poor learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>You are to make a BRIEF video (5-10 minutes) showing yourself attempting the skill or technique with a client (could be real or pretend). Then, you are to review your video using the forms provided in the assessment folder on Blackboard for this task, or any other forms you obtain approval to use.</p>\n<p>You are required to critique your first video attempt - either with a pause and a voice over in the video, or in written format - please include the relevant review form as evidence. You will then re-record the BRIEF video highlighting your improvement in the technique or skill. You will then provide a reflective paragraph at the end about the skill or technique and how you intend to continue to develop it in the future.</p>\n<p>Please note - you will not be assessed on how well you perform the skill, BUT, on how well you critique yourself and reflect on your improvement. With your permission, your videos may be used in the future to help future cohorts of dietetics students to master the suite of techniques and skills, so you will be contributing to our curriculum and resources. If you do not wish for your work to be used for this purpose, please let Dr Olivia Wright know via email <a href=\"mailto:o.wright@uq.edu.au\">o.wright@uq.edu.au</a>. </p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
