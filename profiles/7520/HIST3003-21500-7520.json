A key focus should be what is emphasised in the press, and why, <em>and</em> what is under-emphasised or omitted, and why?</p>\n<p>Such emphases, or lack of emphases, might relate to (but are not limited to): attitudes to the value of Olympic Games; costs; individual and team participation (numbers, gender equity, team composition, or safety of athletes, coaches and support crew); categories of sports; political protest; and many more.</p>\n<p>Consider your chosen dimension/s in relation to broader socio-cultural and political issues, contexts and developments (e.g., women’s and civil rights movements, media developments, war, etc.).</p>\n<p>To develop and provide evidence for your argument, you <em>must</em> use a range of secondary and primary sources, including original newspapers digitised and available via Trove (National Library of Australia): <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper\">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper</a></p>\n<p>Longer newspaper articles will generally provide more information and analysis than shorter ones and will therefore be more valuable for this task.</p>\n<p>You may think that newspapers published in Australian capital cities will be more comprehensive than those published outside the capitals, but that will not always be the case.

You can glean this information from secondary sources.
