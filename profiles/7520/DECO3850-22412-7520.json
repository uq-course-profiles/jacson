It is important to complete inductions early in the semester to ensure that you are able to access the facilities you need to complete your project as the need arises.</p>\n<p>All students are required to undertake the following Physical Computing Induction, incorporating in-person sessions &amp; online modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Space Induction for 78-207 (session times will be posted to Blackboard) = 1 hr in-person</li>\n<li>Soldering 101 tutorial with ETSG (session times will be posted to Blackboard) = 1.5 hr in-person</li>\n<li>Arduino induction</li>\n<li>UQ Innovate Induction for select facilities (session times will be posted to Blackboard) = ~2 hr in-person</li>\n<li>Online modules:</li>\n<li>UQ Innovate - Area Induction, Hand Tools, Lab Safety, Fire Training - all linked from <a href=\"https://student.eait.uq.edu.au/urite/index.wphp?act=show&amp;schedule=752#requirements\">https://student.eait.uq.edu.au/urite/index.wphp?act=show&amp;schedule=752#requirements</a></li>\n<li>OH&amp;S Requirements Declaration - <a href=\"https://student.eait.uq.edu.au/ohs/requirements/\">https://student.eait.uq.edu.au/ohs/requirements/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional items may be added in the event of changes to OH&amp;S requirements.
