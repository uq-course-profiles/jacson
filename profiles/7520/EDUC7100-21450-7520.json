Therefore, show that you have a thorough understanding of the literature and theories of leadership relevant to your chosen topic. In turn, use those understandings as a lens to take a critical look at the school/ organization you are carefully examining. The focus of your assignment should be clearly captured in its title.</p>\n<p>Please discuss with your lecturer if you are unsure of which particular option you would like to choose or if you would like to examine a different aspect of leadership that has been covered in the course but is not listed above.</p>\n<p>It is essential for you to engage with the relevant sections of the text and Course Modules for the assignment -higher quality papers will also draw on other readings as well.
