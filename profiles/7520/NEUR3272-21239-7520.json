You will also submit a brief report (1-2 pages) about the video’s production and an annotated bibliography that is</p>\n<p>your own individual work. A list of possible social behaviours appears on the following pages. You will conduct your analysis using a similar structure to</p>\n<p>Sapolsky's book <em>Behave</em> (2017). After an introduction and a description of the social behaviour, your video should have four of the following five sections:</p>\n<p>1. Seconds-Minutes Before (a neural analysis of what would lead to the behaviour).</p>\n<p>2. Hours to Days Before (a hormone analysis of what would lead to the behaviour).</p>\n<p>3. Brain development</p>\n<p>4. Genetics</p>\n<p>5. Culture or Evolution (this cannot be separated into two sections)</p>\n<p>In each section, you must present original, published research studies that support your analysis. Marks will be assigned for each section based on</p>\n<p>the strength of your arguments and the evidence you cite. Finally, your video should end with a conclusion.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
