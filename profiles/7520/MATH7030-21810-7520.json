(4.2) Explain ideas clearly making appropriate use of examples, counter-examples, special cases, graphs, tables, and visualisation techniques. (4.3) Place results in the context of the development of the area, and compared alternative approaches. (4.4) Use appropriate referencing to original results and a consistent bibliographic style. (4.5) Write clearly in a consistent style and with good organisation."
