Your assignment requires that you show how you would help EAL/D students understand a typical text used to teach curriculum (for example explanations and descriptions of natural phenomena in science; or recounts of events in history; or story writing in English; and many more) and what this text is asking students to do. For that, you need to analyse the text by identifying new or difficult vocabulary used in the text, language expressions, text structure and so on. You then need to develop activities that allow all students to learn about the language and the purpose of the text.</p>\n<p>Work through the following steps:</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong>    <strong>Choose a text for your students</strong></p>\n<p>Based on your understanding of language pedagogy and our course workshops, <strong>choose a text</strong> appropriate to teach a topic in any subject area of the primary curriculum.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to the UQ library and search for Scootle (registration is required, if this is your first time using Scootle. Follow the instructions by entering your UQ email address and you will need to create a password as well. Note this for future visits.) Scootle is a huge database of teaching materials and it is linked to the Australian Curriculum. Browse by Australian Curriculum, choose from English, Maths, Science or F-6/7 HASS, select a year level and a strand. For example, Year 3 Science Understanding, Biological sciences, then view the matching resources.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong>    <strong>Write an analysis of the language and cultural demands of the text you have chosen (600 words)</strong></p>\n<p>You will need to analyse the linguistic and cultural demands within the text. To complete the analysis, you will identify the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Source: curriculum subject area, topic or theme, and relevant year level</li>\n<li>Type of text: written, aural, visual, webpage, video, multimodal or other</li>\n<li>Cultural knowledge: contained within the text, both explained or defined, and assumed</li>\n<li>Language and literacy demands: consider vocabulary, grammatical features, idioms, use of visuals, diagrams, or other modalities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3)</strong>    <strong>Design two language teaching activities based on language pedagogy(1,000 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Using language teaching ideas from Chapters 5, 6 and 7 in your textbook (Gibbons 2015) and Chapters 9 and 10 in Coelho (2012):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create one new activity based on listening or reading, which supports learning the content of the text (don't use existing Scootle activities)</li>\n<li>Create one new activity based on speaking or writing, which supports students demonstrating some knowledge of the text (don't use existing Scootle activities)</li>\n<li>Present these activities in the order they should be taught for effective teaching and learning and to scaffold the students’ understanding of your chosen curriculum text. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4)</strong>    <strong>Write a critical reflection (400 words)</strong></p>\n<p>For the final section of the analysis, write a critical reflection of the relationship between the cultural and language features of the text, and the teaching activities you have designed. Explain how these would support language learning, relevant to the content of the text and with reference to language pedagogy, for example, theories of language acquisition, academic register of school, sociocultural theory of learning, zone of proximal development, scaffolding, high challenge/high support, comprehensible input and output, message abundancy.</p>\n<p>Total approximate length: 2,000 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Australian Professional Standards for Teachers</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Focus/Descriptor</strong></p>\n<p><em>1.3 Students with diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds/</em>Demonstrate knowledge of teaching strategies that are responsive to the learning needs of students from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\n<p><em>4.1 Support student participation/</em>Identify strategies to support inclusive student participation and engagement in classroom activities.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Please select from online resources like websites, articles, e-books, pdfs on relevant websites, online games and activities, and anything else you can find online. Throughout the semester, we will upload links to online resources on Blackboard. You are allowed to use any of these resources for your assignment as well. </p>\n<p>There is no need to create your own resources.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong>    <strong>Background scenario</strong></p>\n<p>There is going to be a large group of students from the same refugee background, enrolling at the regional primary school where you teach because their families have moved to the area for employment and settlement. The families will need help becoming part of the community including English language support to be able to access the curriculum and to settle into the school. The principal has allocated some funds to support and welcome these new students and their families into the school and has asked you to take a leadership role in this. Drawing on all of the content we have covered in this course, consider resources for English language support and community integration. Find at least one on-line resource that would help each of the groups listed here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> New students with an EAL/D background</li>\n<li> Fellow teachers who have little or no experience with students who are learning English as an additional language</li>\n<li>School support staff who will have regular contact with these students, for example at the office, in the tuckshop, in the library or in the playground. You can choose a resource for one or more of these support staff areas.</li>\n<li>The parent-citizen association, who need resources for including the new families in the parent and citizen community, helping new families understand the role of P&amp;C associations in a school.</li>\n<li>The parents of the new families as they engage with the school for the first time</li>\n<li>The existing student population, including those with an EAL/D background</li>\n<li>What kinds of information, processes, and supports will ensure that the school community and new families are able to work together for safe and good settlement and educational outcomes?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong>    <strong>The task</strong></p>\n<p>Create an information brochure for your school community in response to this scenario. The reason for this brochure is to support EAL/D learners and their families, by providing resources not just for them, but for others at the school who wish to understand the newcomers. The whole school plays a role in this and the information brochure needs to cater for the EAL/D students and their families as well as the whole school community. </p>\n<p>In your introductory page, you should provide a synthesis of key understandings of multilingualism (500 words), referencing readings from our course and beyond, and expressed in language that is accessible to the diverse target audience. This brochure should reflect the ideas and content you have engaged with across the duration of this course. It is anticipated that you would commence this task early in the semester, and work on it across the semester, as you engage with new and relevant content.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the brochure, develop a section for each group listed above and include 1-2 hyperlnks to online resources that are relevant for each of the groups.You need to provide written explanations for each of the online resources you include. Please write a maximum of 200 words for the 1-2 links you have included for each group section.</p>\n<p>Please target the 200 word (max) explanation at the specific audience of that page. In other words, think about how to present the information to each particular audience, and consider different modalities for this purpose (e.g. images, diagrams, colour, font size and style). Across the different sections in your brochure, we expect that <em>how</em> you communicate your written explanations will vary, depending on your target audience (i.e. you will communicate differently with teachers, compared to when your audience is students or parents). Resources might support English language learning as well as processes at school (typical daily routines and practices etc), classroom (teaching approaches etc) and interpersonal (friendships etc) level. In your 200 word explanation, refer to course concepts and theories from our course and include references from our readings and additional literature, to link your explanations of why these resources are useful for particular audiences to research evidence. In a final page of the brochure, list <strong>all</strong> references used across your whole brochure, applying APA 7th . In your text in the introductory page and the individual group sections, include references briefly like this: (Smithering, 2009), following the APA 7th in-text referencing conventions. Full references of these in-text references should then be provided on the separate final page that has a references list of ALL references used in your information brochure. You DO NOT have to provide references for the resources you have linked to your individual group sections, as the links are already there. Please provide a separate reference list for all images, diagrams etc you might have used in your information brochure.</p>\n<p>There is a general rule of plus/minus 10% for word count requirements.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong>    <strong>Submission</strong></p>\n<p>Submit your information brochure as word document to TurnItIn, through the link provided in Blackboard under Assessment.  </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
