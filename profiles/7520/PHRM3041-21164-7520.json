Results are reported in the form of an oral presentation using PowerPoint slides (or equivalent).</li>\n<li>The oral presentation must be delivered in-person at UQ Dutton Park during the scheduled Workshop. Students may request an earlier presentation slot by contacting the course coordinator, who will approve requests at their discretion.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to the marking criteria. Marks will be awarded for demonstrating a strong understanding of the subject matter and concepts. This includes providing clear, detailed, and well-organized explanations. To showcase your understanding authentically, aim to speak naturally and avoid reading directly from a script. Instead, focus on engaging with your audience and explaining the topic in your own words.</li>\n<li>The marking criteria includes marks for time management. You will be penalised for going overtime. The maximum time limit for your presentation is exactly 10:00 minutes. The penalties for being overtime are: ≤ 15 seconds overtime – no penalty; &gt; 15 seconds overtime – 100% loss of timing marks. There is no minimum time limit.</li>\n<li>If you use any references, include a list using the author-date referencing system, specifically the APA 7th referencing style from the American Psychological Association. The UQ Library has a <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">style guide</a> to help students adhere to the APA 7th conventions. Cite all references that you use, including UQ Extend.</li>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</li>\n<li>Please refer to Learn.UQ (Blackboard) for the video report instructions and marking criteria.</li>\n<li>This oral presentation will be recorded and retained as per university policy. The recording will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed if required for the purposes of moderation of marking; provision of feedback to the student; and/or re-marking following a successful re-mark application.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
