These may stem from B2C, B2B or C2C encounters and should occur across a range of service providers/industries. </p>\n<p>For example, your five interactions could consist of: 1) buying your morning coffee, 2) shopping online for a new book, 3) booking a table at your favourite restaurant, 4) buying a second hand bike, 5) interacting with your suppliers at work. You don’t have to have interactions from each encounter type (i.e. B2C, B2B or C2C), nor do your service interactions have to involve technology (i.e. they may not include technology at all), but you <strong>MUST have them from different service providers and industries</strong>.</p>\n<p>In responding to the criteria outlined in the log template critically reflect on your service interactions in relation to your feelings, thoughts and behaviours resultant from the service interactions.

In this course we explore various technologies which are infused into service interactions across various service sectors (i.e. VR, augmented reality, self-service technologies, wearables, service robots). Students may choose one of these technologies or any other they wish to gain a deeper insight into. </p>\n<p>You are to write a technology insight brief that outlines the impact and implications of infusing this technology into service interactions across service sectors. The focus of this assessment is on critiquing the technology itself and its use within service interactions, rather than the implementation or adoption of a technology by a specific service organization (that is the focus of assessment 3 for the course).</p>\n<p>Within this assessment you are being asked to describe the technology and critique its application within service interactions. The technology insight brief should address the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe the technology sufficiently to outline the role it plays in service interactions and how it impacts service employee and consumer roles.</li>\n<li>How the technology can enhance customer and service provider value.</li>\n<li>Challenges and opportunities faced by service organizations in infusing this technology into service interactions.</li>\n<li>Key ethical considerations for the infusion of this technology into various service settings.</li>\n<li>Describe how this technology would be viewed from the perspective of a Futurist. (Where does this technology fit into broader trends and/or future trends? Outline those trends in answering this question).</li>\n<li>Describe how this technology would be viewed from the perspective of a Strategist. (Where does this technology fit in terms of a system(s) – teams, product lines, organizations, industries, markets, societies – as wholes. Describe the network of interacting forces). </li>\n<li>Describe how this technology could be used to reframe difficult conditions (provide examples of such conditions) to uncover hidden opportunities (less obvious opportunities).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your discussion is to be supported by current research and industry practice.
