All lab work is assessed individually.</p>\n<p>Performance in the lab session will be assessed using a combination of completing prelab questions, active participation and performance in the lab, and completed lab sheet including recorded results and discussions. At the end of each session course staff will mark the lab sheets and provide feedback. Hence, good preparation is required for a good outcome in each lab session.</p>\n<p>As lab sessions are designed to complete within the set time limit, NO STUDENT can enter the lab 20 minutes after the start time of each lab session.</p>\n<p>Students are required to present their student ID when submitting the reports at the end of the session.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
