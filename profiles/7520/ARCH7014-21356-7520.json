It culminates in the presentation of an Exhibition Poster that combines both text and graphic requirements that critically analyse a single building from the 1980s or 1990s. </p>\n<p>TASK 1: Exhibition Poster</p>\n<p>Students will research a nominated building and to design a poster that presents the project as part of a hypothetical exhibition of late twentieth-century architecture—a period marked by the rise of Post-Modernism.</p>\n<p>TASK 2: Exhibition Poster (Presentation)</p>\n<p>The posters will be pinned up for exhibition and presentation. While the posters should require little (if any) verbal explanation, students should be prepared to briefly introduce their buildings to a group (1-2 min), and to discuss the key ideas and themes of the project with teaching staff and peers (max. 3-4 mins). Please note that no formal feedback will be provided during the presentation, nor is the oral presentation assessed. Rather, the presentation is to demonstrate the student's understanding of a given building and, more importantly, to share this research with the group in a collaborative learning environment.</p>\n<p>Formative feedback and advice on the development of Assignment 1: Exhibition Poster will be given in the weekly tutorials and during the presentations. Summative feedback will be given on the rubrics provided on Ultra / Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
            "submission_guidelines": "<p>The School of Architecture, Design and Planning uses Blackboard and Turnitin for assessment submission. Turnitin is accessed through the course Blackboard site. Turnitin also checks for plagiarism or instances where the original work of others is not appropriately acknowledged. Uploaded files must contain readable text and not be rasterised. Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission. To meet professional accreditation, public engagement and quality assurance obligations, digital copies of all course assessment items must be submitted in addition to any hard copy submission requirements specified in individual Course / Studio Outlines. Any physical models should be photographed and a minimum of two photographs describing the complete and full model must be included in the digital submission.</p>",
