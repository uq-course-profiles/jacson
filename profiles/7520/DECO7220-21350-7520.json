            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Data visualisations and information graphics are visual approaches to communicating complex data that are difficult to convey using text &amp; tables. These forms of graphic communication explain complexities, reveal relationships in statistics, visualise complex processes, provide instruction in ways that promote &amp; enhance understanding for the reader. Information graphics has spread beyond news media, into instructional design, scientific visualisation, product design, education, information technology, business and more, in settings where the graphic representation of data or processes provides a more meaningful outcome for the reader.</p>\n<p>Designing data stories requires more than translating what can be read into a visual format. It requires filtering of information, revealing of relationships between information sets, discovery of patterns and the representation of this in a visual manner that is meaningful to the reader. In this project, students will create an A2 (594mm x 420mm) poster to communicate the topic described in the <strong>Visualisation Plan</strong> through a well-structured and considered narrative so that the reader can interpret &amp; understand the information presented in a meaningful way. It's likely that additional data &amp; sources will be used to construct a clear narrative and provide support for communicating the central dataset. The poster is expected to have at least one visualisation presents complex data with multiple relationships, as well as a series of more simple visualisations; all of which work together to provide a coherent narrative.</p>\n<p>Printed posters will be showcased and submitted during the practical sessions in Week 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI &amp; Machine Translation (MT) Tools</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is aimed at students understanding and being able to effectively apply graphic design and information visualisation concepts to the visual communication of complex data, a task that requires a level of creativity and critical thinking.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Generative AI technologies, successful completion of this task will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>Generative AI Tools and techniques may be utilized as <em>supportive </em>elements.
