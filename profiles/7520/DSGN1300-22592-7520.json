Your portfolio will include three distinct items, each requiring multiple variations to demonstrate technical proficiency and versatility. </p>\n<p>Submission items: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visual Instruction Sheet (PDF): Design a step-by-step visual instruction sheet for preparing a favourite dish. The sheet needs to include a minimum of six distinct steps captured as visual elements (such as icons or illustrations) and can include written components to accompany these. 10% weighting.</li>\n<li>Data Visualisation Infographic (PDF):<strong> </strong>Create an infographic to present <a href=\"https://www.pbi.uq.edu.au/ClientServices/UQStatistics/index.aspx\">UQ’s Student Load in, and changes between, 2023 to 2024</a>. 10% weighting.</li>\n<li>TED Talk Visual Summary (PDF): Summarise the key ideas of a TED Talk in a one-page visual format. The visual summary should focus on typographic elements emphasising hierarchy and typography to communicate the message effectively along with the use icons to visually represent key concepts. 10% weighting.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will need to submit three variations of each item using the same object outlines. </p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.
