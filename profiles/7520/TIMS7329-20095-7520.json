From an assessment point of view then, this means that you will be assessed based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your actual individual impacts</li>\n<li>How consistently you contribute impacts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s look at each:</p>\n<p><em>Actual Individual Impact:</em></p>\n<p>Within social enterprises there are usually two main impacts: business and social. So, you need to provide evidence here of the things you did in the project and how they created business, social or both types of impact.</p>\n<p><em>Consistent Contributions (weekly productivity):</em></p>\n<p>It is not enough to contribute every now and again throughout the semester. Businesses don’t run that way. You need to be working towards creating an impact through weekly activities that you do. So, you also need to provide evidence of how you maintained a strong weekly work ethic to making your social enterprise team achieve its impacts. This is an issue of productivity – a measure of how much time you spent on the project and how that time led to meaningful results in terms of actual impact.</p>\n<p>So, in this section of the plan you need to fill out the relevant table as set out on the next page.</p>\n<p>This Table then constitutes your Individual Impact Statement. Try to provide as much detail as you can in the columns “Activities you Did”, “Results”. This is your chance to advance your case as to why you deserve a certain grade. But you’ll also most likely have good weeks and bad weeks in terms of results or have weeks where you did a lot of activities and others that were light (because of assessments in other courses, for instance). Just be honest about all this. Use the comments column to shed light on what was happening for you in that week. What you want to aim for though is to make sure that overall you have worked hard (Activities you Did) and most of that work converted into meaningful outcomes. The Table plus peer evaluations (which we discuss next) are the only things you need to submit in this section.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Diary of Individual Impact</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Week</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Activities </strong></li>\n<li><strong>State what you did and how long you did it for. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>(eg. researched theory of change for 2 hours)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Uptake (Was your work taken up by the team?)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If YES, state how your work was used by the team. (eg. my research was directly included in our presentation where we mention the root cause)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
