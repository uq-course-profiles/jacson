Examples include control room operators, dispatchers, emergency response personnel, medical &amp; nursing staff, pilots, train drivers, engineers, financial analysts, and salespeople. The program should focus on training people how to become an expert, or how to improve their current level of expertise. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will need access to one or more subject matter experts so that you can carry out a training needs analysis and develop the content for the program. You would typically need at least 10 hours of your subject matter expert's time. For this reason, it generally works best if the subject matter expert is a member of the group, or a friend or family member.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The first step is to carry out a training needs analysis. The first report should present the results of this analysis, and should include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organisational analysis. This involves an assessment of the organisation's strategic learning goals, the existing learning systems and the learning culture. </li>\n<li>Work analysis. This involves an assessment of the tasks carried out by role incumbents, and the knowledge and skills required to carry out those roles effectively.</li>\n<li>Person analysis. This involves an assessment of who needs to be given learning opportunities in order to meet the organisation's strategic learning goals. This assessment is informed by an analysis of expertise (how experts make effective decisions, and the types of difficulties that are faced by novices as they are learning the task).</li>\n<li>Recommendations. This involves developing a set of recommendations regarding the key learning needs. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your analysis should be presented in the form of a technical report, which contains the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Executive Summary. This section should provide a concise summary of the key points in the report.</li>\n<li>Background. This section should describe the background to the project, explain the aims of the report, and define the scope of your work.</li>\n<li>Analysis. This section should present a clear and thorough analysis of the training needs for the client organisation using the methods described above.</li>\n<li>Recommendations. This section should present a set of preliminary recommendations for learning and development, based on the results of the analysis and what we know about the science of learning. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The report should be de-identified. It should not include any identifying information regarding the organisation or subject matter expert, and should include the following statement on the cover page:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>\"This document is a student assignment that was completed for PSYC7484 Advanced Personnel Training at The University of Queensland.
