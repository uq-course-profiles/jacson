Typically guest speakers will be invited to give formal speeches for students to practice consecutive and simultaneous interpreting between English and LOTE (Chinese/Japanese). In the first half of the 3-hour class, students will practice consecutive and simultaneous interpreting. In the second half of the 3-hour class, they will be guided by the lecturer to engage in self-assessment and/or peer assessment using the assessment criteria and marking rubric for this course and using ELAN (a free software that can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download\">https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download</a>) as a tool for annotating the positive and negative aspects of interpreting performance. <strong>Students are required to conduct in-depth self-assessment of their interpreting performance for 4 out of the 6 in-class interpreting sessions.</strong></p>\n<p>Based on their self-assessment each time, they will be required to write a short self-assessment report (<strong>approximately 600-700 words</strong>) that includes (1) brief and objective overall assessment of their interpreting performance (especially accuracy, target language proficiency and delivery), (2) in-depth analysis of approximately 3 representative examples from their interpretations (e.g., good interpretations showing use of interpreting strategies and conscious decision-making and major or minor interpretation errors indicating room for improvement) and (3) a small, concrete and achievable goal for that week to improve one particular aspect of interpreting performance. No references are needed for the self-assessment report. Templates and examples will be provided to students in week 1 to facilitate their self-assessment.</p>\n<p>Students' self-assessment report will be assessed according to a marking rubric for this assessment item in this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI and MT Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
