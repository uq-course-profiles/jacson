This mark (18 points) includes quality of participation only (for 9 tutorials taking place from Week 3 onwards). Students who do not attend tutorials will be deemed to have not fulfilled this component of the assessment and will be marked accordingly. Students should ensure that they have prepared for each tutorial by completing the required readings and any other preparatory work. Turning up but not participating in the discussions and activities based on the required readings is not an option in this course.</p>\n<p>Should a student not be able to attend a tutorial for a legitimate reason - as outlined in the Course Profile (like sickness, loss of family member, etc...) and determined by the course coordinator - a 400-500 word answer to one of the core questions discussed in the tutorial for the week missed can be submitted to the course convener to make up for the marks missed. Students MUST contact the course coordinator PRIOR to the tutorial by email (and details and reasons for absence) and the course coordinator will provide the student the question to write about. Please note, in order to qualify for this, you will need to be able to provide evidence from a doctor or other authorities (here the rules for extensions like for any regular essay applies - please consult these rules in the Course Profile).</p>\n<p>In sum, the quality of your tutorial participation, not your attendance, determines your mark here. In each tutorial, you will be able to score a maximum of 2 points for the quality of your participation. Over the course of 9 weeks, you can thereby score 18 points. Half way through the semester, the course coordinator will tell you how you have scored in the first half of tutorials.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT).
