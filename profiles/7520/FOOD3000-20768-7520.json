During teaching weeks 2 to 7, groups will collaborate to discuss the designated food product, gather information from various sources (e.g., readings, library databases, books, research papers), and identify three market products that can substitute the designated product. The summary should be submitted via Turnitin by Week 7. Group members are encouraged to communicate outside regular hours to coordinate and complete the assessments. Additionally, the instructor will be available during tutorial sessions to address any queries. Each group member is responsible for evaluating the individual contributions of the other two members to the summary (Peer Assessment).</p>\n<p><strong>Details of the summary are as outlined below:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part A</strong>: Investigate the assigned food product and provide a summary that includes (A) the composition of the food product with a focus on the functional components; (B) an explanation of the health benefits arising from these functional components; (C) an examination of the regulations linked to the functional components in the food product, referring to FSANZ and utilizing the Nutrient Profiling Calculator for health claims; and (D) conclude by identifying and justifying the single most critical functional component in the assigned food. The maximum word count for this section is 500 words. <strong>(Group work)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part B</strong>: Based on the information gathered, each group member should find one suitable substitute (market product) for the assigned functional food and provide a summary following the same format as Part A for the assigned food product. The maximum word count for this section is 500 words. <strong>(Individual task)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part C</strong>: Lastly, the group should identify and discuss the most suitable substitute from the three market products identified, drawing comparisons with the assigned functional food product. The maximum word count for this section is 500 words. <strong>(Group work)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary Format</strong>: Use Microsoft Word®, Font: Arial/Times New Roman, Font Size: 12.
