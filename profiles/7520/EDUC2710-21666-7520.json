A comprehensive understanding of the essential role of creativity in child-centred education will also assist you to develop innovative Arts experiences which link to the wider Australian curriculum. </p>\n<p>Preparing to teach the Arts also requires ability to <strong><em>select and utilise</em></strong> high quality resources.

Explain or justify the final revisions based on this peer feedback by linking ideas back to the Arts curriculum, and to the course content and readings on authentic arts practice and embedding Indigenous perspectives.
