The written material must be in the format specified in the Course Handbook, typed, and no longer than two pages text (A4, double spacing) with an additional single 1 page presenting the formulation as a diagram. Each Client Role-play Summary must be submitted via Turnitin at the end of the tutorial in which the role-play was conducted. Each Client Role-play Summary will be assessed and assigned either a “pass” (5/5) or “fail” (0/5). If a student’s Client Role-play Summary receives a “fail”, the student must repeat the exercise and provide a video-recording of another role-play and a Client Role-play Summary for assessment. This process will be repeated until the student has passed two Client Role-play Summaries. It is a requirement that students \"pass\" both case studies in order to satisfy requirements of the course.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Each student will also complete and submit two interview feedback forms associated with their role as the observer during the role plays. Each will be assessed as \"pass\" (2.5/2.5) or \"fail\" (0/2.5). This is completed during the role play and handed to the tutor at the end of the role play. Please consult the course manual for for information about this assessment.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This component contributes 15% to the final grade.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>If a student who is scheduled to role-play a client is unable to attend for the role-play at the scheduled time, the student will need to arrange to do a role-play and have it video-recorded. The video-recording and an accompanying written Client Role-play Summary must then be submitted to the tutor via Turnitin to be assessed.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The length restrictions for the case study are important because in clinical practice it is essential that intake interviews are written up in charts, files or reports in a concise, clear and professional manner. It is expected that the quality of the case study report be such that it could be placed in the client’s UQ Psychology Clinic file and could be forwarded to another professional. The case study is worth 35%. Guidelines to assist in the writing of the case studies and the marking criteria for the case study are provided in the course manual. <strong>No identifying information (e.g. name, DOB, address, names of relatives etc) should be used in the case study</strong>. Over Length Case Studies: Written material beyond the designated page length will not be read.

If a student fails an assessment, additional clinical competencies assessments must be undertaken until an adequate level of competency is reached. After the supervisor has discussed his/her assessment of the student's interview with the student, the supervisor or student should upload the completed Clinical Competencies Checklist to Turnitin.
