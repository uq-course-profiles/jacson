For each shot, you must identify the stylistic features and techniques used in the shot, separating them under \"Mise-en-Scene\", \"Cinematography\" and \"Editing\" and describe how they are used. In your notes, please underline or bold-face terms from <em>Film Art</em>, the course textbook, and indicate in brackets the page number of the book where they are defined.</p>\n<p>On a separate page, you will write an analytical discussion of the sequence you have annotated (800 words, plus or minus 10%), explaining how the techniques you have written about create particular effects in the scene. Your discussion should have a thesis statement, an introduction and conclusion, and be presented in paragraphs. Your work should present an argument about how form and style creates a particular effect in the clip, carefully describing particular aspects of style (e.g.: mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing) AND making a claim about how these aspects function together. You should use quotations or paraphrasing from <em>Film Art</em> to support your argument.</p>\n<p><strong>Academic Integrity and AI/MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

You will answer the question primarily through close analysis of film form and style (including mise-en-scene, cinematography, sound and editing). Your essay must have a central argument and make a claim about how aspects of form and style function together via a thesis statement. As we are asking you to look at two films, this argument should also be comparative – you should compare the form and style of the two clips. You must demonstrate your understanding of the terms and concepts in the course textbook <em>Film Art</em> by including references to the textbook in your essay. You must also use appropriate research to support your argument, using a minimum of <strong>two (2) academic sources</strong> outside of the course readings.</p>\n<p>Your referencing and formatting style must adhere to that which is stipulated in the 17th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style, Author-date style. Please refer to the task sheet for more guidance on formatting.</p>\n<p>Please do NOT include still images in your essay.</p>\n<p><strong>Process Notes: </strong>In tutorials, you will complete a series of writing exercises related to conceptualising your essay and you must submit them alongside your essay for this assignment.
