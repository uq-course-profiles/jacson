You should develop the project plan through consultation with your supervisor.</p>\n<p><strong>Format of Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The page margins should be set to 2cm all round, the pages should be numbered and 12pt Calibri (or equivalent) or Times New Roman (or equivalent) fonts should be used. The first page of the plan (not counted in the total number of pages) should carry your project title, your name and student number, and your supervisor’s details. The maximum length of the plan should be an 10 page introduction plus a 1 page plan.</p>\n<p><strong>The first part of the project plan</strong> should be a thorough introduction to your area of research, which should be produced through careful consideration of the current scientific literature (and any company documentation where relevant) pertinent to the project. </p>\n<p><strong>The second part of the project plan</strong> should include a brief description of the main aim(s) of your research project, followed by a brief outline of the proposed research strategies that you will use to meet the aims of your project. No more than one page should be used for this section.</p>\n<p>This assessment item will be marked by your Supervisor.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

One of the arts of scientific writing is to organise ideas and results concisely and with least repetition. The total length, exclusive of references figures and tables, i.e. consisting of the text for the Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion and Conclusions, should not exceed 80 pages (excluding the bibliography). There may be instances, such as industrial placement, where an alternative format is justified, this should be agreed with the course coordinator. </p>\n<p>This assessment item will be marked by two examiners.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
