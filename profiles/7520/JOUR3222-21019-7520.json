The artefacts should demonstrate an idea for using a computing technology in a journalistic context, that is, to address an issue, report a story or provoke new thinking about existing practice. The artefacts can be digital or physical. All artefacts need to be retained for 30 days after the release of grades. Any files hosted on a third-party platform should be downloaded or exported.</p>\n<p><strong>Design process </strong></p>\n<p>Explain how you developed the artefact, ie: how you used (or did not use) the JxD process. Explain the contextual research, processes of making and any evaluation (feedback) you undertook. Articulate what you learned as a result of these steps and how insights and evidence that emerged at each stage informed subsequent design decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>\n<p>Write a reflective response to this question: </p>\n<p><em>What does your prototype or the design process tell you about the future of journalism?</em></p>\n<p>Answer the question with reference to theory and practice. Draw on your own project as well as academic literature discussed in the course modules or consulted separately. Your work this semester will have resulted in insights or new ideas for journalism. We want you to position that concept within a broader context of theory and practice and consider its value to journalism.</p>\n<p><strong>Please consult the Design Portfolio Task Sheet on Blackboard for more detail, including structure and grading.</strong></p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.

To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
