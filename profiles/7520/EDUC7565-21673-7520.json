Your video will explore a real-life Mathematics situation which links to a specific Content Descriptor from the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics Learning Area. Your teaching video must be logically sequenced and evidence your knowledge and understanding of contemporary teaching strategies that include verbal and non-verbal communication and a range of suitable resources including ICT to support student engagement.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Teachers often use videos as focus activities to stimulate student learning and engagement. The fact that you can make your own videos means that you can bring focus and relevance from the real world to the classroom. You can also make the link between Mathematics and Numeracy more readily than in the past. In the classroom, teacher video production serves as an important model for students who are making their own videos using devices such as iPads. Your use of software such as iMovie or Movie Maker will allow you to develop technical and communication skills in critical and creative ways to expand curriculum learning opportunities for all students including those from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds. At the same time, you will develop knowledge and understanding of the kinds of teaching strategies needed for using ICT such as those involved in the use and production of videos to support and expand curriculum learning opportunities for students. You will also identify relevant and appropriate strategies for assessment that you would use with this video.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part A - The video</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The video your group produce is to be approximately 3 minutes duration (+ or - 30 seconds)</li>\n<li>It is to address an Australian Curriculum: Mathematics content descriptor for a year level and Mathematics strand of your choice</li>\n<li>You must choose a real-life context that illustrates the focus Mathematics content descriptor in a Numeracy context</li>\n<li>Your video must be made at a suitable viewing standard for the year level to which the Mathematics content descriptor relates. It should be of standard to use in class if you have the opportunity during a future professional experience context.</li>\n<li>The content of your video must be organised into a logical learning and teaching sequence</li>\n<li>Your video must reflect understanding of appropriate teaching and assessment strategies in Mathematics for the content and year level selected, e.g., use of multiple representations, clear articulation of concepts, age appropriate pacing, assessment tools</li>\n<li>Your video must reflect technical and creative skills in communication in critical and creative ways</li>\n<li>Your video must demonstrate knowledge of a range of resources including ICT</li>\n<li>The video must be filmed in a compatible mode for easy viewing and downloading for assessment purposes. (This will be discussed in lectures and tutorials.)</li>\n<li>Do not feel that you have to make a ‘professional’ video. For a teacher-produced classroom video, it has to be competently made in a timely fashion to be sustainable. The information has to be correct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The stimulus for your video is to be from the real world. Numeracy is all around us and it is up to you to match an Australian Curriculum: Mathematics Content Descriptor to a Numeracy situation from the real world. To search the Content Descriptors go to https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/ Here you can scan through the year levels to find a Content Descriptor that might be suitable for your video. Check out the different year levels and the different strands i.e., Number and Algebra, Measurement and Geometry, and Statistics and Probability</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part B - The research brief</strong></p>\n<p>This task also requires you to <strong>individually</strong> produce a research brief (1000 words) in which you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make connections between the real world and learning and teaching of Mathematics and Numeracy in the classroom clear</li>\n<li>Describe and explain the benefits of using ICT such as teacher-produced videos to enhance student knowledge, understanding and skills in Mathematics and Numeracy</li>\n<li>Describe and explain the choice and use of multiple representations of Mathematical knowledge and concepts to improve student learning</li>\n<li>Identify and justify a range of relevant and appropriate assessment approaches to be used in conjunction with this video tool</li>\n<li>Include details of the technical and communication skills you used and a research-informed justification for how these were designed to expand learning opportunities for all students including those from diverse backgrounds</li>\n<li>Include a rationale for engaging with multiple sources of professional learning to continuously improve student learning and your future teaching</li>\n<li>Provide insights about implications for your future teaching and professional learning especially in relation to the implementation of teaching strategies for using ICT to expand student learning opportunities</li>\n<li>Use knowledge of the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics content to make informed suggestions about how you would implement teaching strategies for using ICT to engage students in year levels different from those targeted in your video.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
