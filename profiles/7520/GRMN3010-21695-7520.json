These tasks will closely follow the comprehension texts studied in class and will be posted on Blackboard following completion of class discussion of the comprehension text in question.</p>\n<p>How the Portfolio is compiled:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each student submits a writing task of approximately 250 words following discussion of the comprehension text in class. Students do not need to write on each comprehension text treated in class but are asked to <strong>select four </strong>that interest them over the course of the semester. Students submit a preliminary draft in response to their chosen texts to the lecturer <strong>within two weeks </strong>of the last class discussion in each case. Drafts submitted more than two weeks after the discussion of a particular text in class will not be considered unless an approved extension is in place.</li>\n<li>The lecturer will provide feedback on each of the four writing tasks. <strong>Students are required to use this feedback to complete a final version of the writing task in each case</strong>. Texts that have not first been submitted to the lecturer cannot be presented in the portfolio. Only one round of feedback will be provided on each draft.</li>\n<li>The assessment of the portfolio will be partly based on the <strong>student's capacity to respond to the feedback provided</strong> on the preliminary draft and partly in terms of the accuracy and stylistic features of the final product.</li>\n<li>Students are reminded that the portfolio must be prepared <strong>independently</strong> without the help of a tutor or supporter. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
