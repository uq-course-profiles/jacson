During the student grand round presentation, you will have an opportunity to practice your skills in effectively communicating a medication management plan using the SOAP/SBAR communication frameworks. This skill is valuable in real-life practice when discussing a medication management plan with another clinician, doctor, or nurse, whether in person or over the phone. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>What? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will work in a group of 3-4 students. Each group will be assigned an integrated case for which they will outline medication- or disease-related problems and their recommendations to resolve those problems. The cases will be posted on Learn.UQ (Blackboard) at least two weeks prior to the scheduled grand round session. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>How? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each group of students is expected to deliver a 5-7 minutes presentation. Guidance on how to structure the presentation will be provided two weeks prior to the presentation. You will have the opportunity to ask questions about your cases and the student grand round during tutorials. </li>\n<li>See Learn.UQ (Blackboard) for the marking criteria and rubric for this assessment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This presentation will be recorded and retained as per university policy.

It helps you become actively involved in your learning and solidifies knowledge and skills you pick up from lectures, grand round and tutorials. Reflection also helps you build up your skills of recognising mistakes you might have made and then put an action plan to prevent you making those same mistakes moving forward. As future pharmacy interns and pharmacists, reflection will be a part of your everyday clinical practice. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>What? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will <strong>reflect on your experience </strong>listening to a presentation about a patient case in the Grand Rounds presentations.
