This proposal must be based on an in-depth review of the literature in an area of synbio of the student's choice, and must be fully referenced and be accompanied by a lay description that is designed to attract attention to the proposal.The written component will comprise 15% of the total mark for BIOC3900.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to participate in three workshops in practical times to develop their proposals. Satisfactory performance in this exercise will require students to come to the workshop prepared to talk about their paper, including in a '3MT' format, and, in some sessions show an illustrations they will use in their proposals. Students will also be required to listen to and ask questions of their peers and contribute to group discussions to earn marks for workshop participation.
