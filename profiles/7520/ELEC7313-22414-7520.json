The grouping will be arranged during the PBL time. For the second and third PBL assignments based on groups, one group member is responsible for submitting the assignments online through UQ Blackboard. Each group only needs one submission for each group based PBL assignment. Group peer assessment is optional. Peer assessment should be provided in percentage regarding communication, timeliness and contribution. For example, student-A in a group of 2 students provides 50% Communication, 70% Timeliness and 80% Contribution for himself, and 50% Communication, 30% Timeliness and 20% Contribution for his group member. This means he thinks his overall performance (200% in total) is twice better than his group member (100% in total). Peer assessment needs to be submitted individually and confidentially to the course coordinator via emails before the due date of the assessment item. NOTE: if there is no peer review submitted by the due date, we will assume all of you have contributed equally. For a situation with large discrepancy, the lecturer or demonstrators will talk to whoever involved.
