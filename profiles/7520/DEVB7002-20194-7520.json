The wiki page is expected to be up-to-date with the current literature on the given topic and be organised in an effective way so as to communicate the state of knowledge to a wider audience. In addition, the final page must observe all standards with respect to copyright and source referencing. Creativity and a professional style are highly encouraged and required for maximum marks.</p>\n<p>The assignment is in two parts. First there is the creation of a page outline (worth 5%) that is submitted for feedback. After feedback, groups will continue to work on their assignments, with the final page (worth 15%) due for submission nearer the end of term.</p>\n<p>The outline consists of the production of an framework for the wiki page and will constitute a breakdown of the format and \"subtopics\" that will be covered by the page. The purpose of the outline is two pronged: getting group members together to think about the content of their pages early in the semester to allow for better time management, and allowing the direction of the assignment to be evaluated before major investments of time and energy are put into the wiki page. The outline will be assessed on the detail of the wiki page framework, the organisation of the proposed page, evidence of creativity and whether there is a demonstration of insight into how the topic will be presented (visually and content).</p>\n<p>The page outline is a group submission, all members of the group will receive the same mark for the outline of the wiki page.</p>\n<p>For the final page, one wiki page per group will be submitted and worth a total of 15%. However, there is a small component of the overall mark for the final page that is generated from peer marking, so not every group member will necessarily receive the same mark for the wiki page.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance.
