You will be asked to read the assigned reading and answer a few questions about the key concepts/main points in the reading. The questions will help you find where you should focus in preparing for class. Guided reading questions are available from the Slides, Questions and Handout folder in the Learning Resources folder in Blackboard.

Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Please read the following instructions carefully before you start working on your essay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This should be <strong>an argumentative essay</strong> that proves your argument or point of view about an issue related to one of the topics given above. Please note that the topics we give you are very broad; once you’ve picked a topic you’re interested in, you will need to narrow it down and decide on a more specific topic for your essay. To do this, you will need to understand and know the literature on the topic. For example, within topic 1 “Issues of the native speaker in teaching English as an international language,’ you might discuss <em>the status of native and non-native English-speaking teachers in teaching English as an international language</em>, or <em>whether or not native speaker competence should be the model for English teaching and learning.</em></li>\n<li>Once you have decided on a specific topic for your essay, create an outline for the essay. Relying upon literature, theories introduced in the course, and your experience, your essay should include:</li>\n<li>An introduction paragraph that introduces the broad topic and the more specific topic. The intro should have a clear thesis statement that tells the reader clearly the key argument/viewpoint you want to prove/disprove in your essay. You may choose to agree or disagree or discuss both sides of a topic/issue. In this intro paragraph you may also specify how the essay is organised to provide optimal guidance to the reader.</li>\n<li>The body of your essay should include:</li>\n<li>Explanations/definitions of all key terms/concepts that you consider essential for the reader to understand your arguments. You need to rely on the literature related to your chosen topic to provide appropriate explanations of terms.</li>\n<li>Several main arguments to support your thesis statement. For these arguments, you need to review findings from at least five empirical research papers that have been done on the topic you choose and use them to support your arguments. Also, do not just list these studies. Show your engagement with the literature on the chosen topic by discussing (where possible)</li>\n<li>similarities and differences among the studies about your chosen topic</li>\n<li>the conclusions or results obtained from these studies and how they might relate to the concepts/theories discussed in the course and your own understanding and experience of the topic.</li>\n<li>A paragraph discussing what pedagogical implications you can draw from the above discussion of your chosen topic for teaching English or other second languages.</li>\n<li>When you include your understanding and experiences, you should go beyond just your “personal thoughts” but rather explore and examine the topic as you have come to understand it from the materials provided in the course and your own journey in learning and teaching second languages. When appropriate, provide examples to support your arguments.</li>\n<li>A concluding paragraph that summarises key points in the essay.</li>\n<li>Some other notes:</li>\n<li>Use of headings: You can use headings and subheadings in your essay to better guide the reader, but this is not compulsory. If you think the different parts of your essay flow together well without headings, that should be fine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Submission:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write the number of words at the end of your essay.</li>\n<li>Fill in the self-assessment sheet (given in class and available in BB) and submit it online.</li>\n<li>No hard copy is required.</li>\n<li>Check the similarity score by submitting your draft essay to Turnitin TRIAL before submitting your final copy.</li>\n<li>You must submit your final essay to Turnitin's FINAL site.</li>\n<li>If you submit to the wrong site, your assessment will NOT be marked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Use of AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
