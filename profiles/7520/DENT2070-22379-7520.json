Each group will have <strong>3 or 4 students </strong>and the video blog is to be submitted on Blackboard in week 13 at the end of semester 1 2025. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A newly qualified dental graduate is expected to develop competency in critical thinking which is described in the Australian Dental Council's <a href=\"https://www.adc.org.au/sites/default/files/Media_Libraries/PDF/Accreditation/Professional%20Competencies%20of%20the%20Newly%20Qualified%20Dentist_rebrand.pdf\">\"Professional competencies of the newly qualified dentist\"</a> document as \"the process of assimilating and analysing information, encompassing an interest in finding new solutions, a professional curiosity with an ability to admit to any lack of understanding, a willingness to examine beliefs and assumptions and to search for evidence that supports the acceptance, rejection or suspension of those beliefs and assumptions, and the ability to distinguish between fact and opinion\". </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In this assessment, students should produce a group video blog (4-6 mins) that demonstrates a reflection of the clinical group's experience at the Oral Health Centre clinics. The reflection should be based on a clinical experience or a range of experiences that your clinical group will have participated or observed within <strong>weeks 7-13 of Semester 1 2025</strong>. The video will need to describe the experience, analyse the experience and reflect on how it has informed both personal and group's future practice. The video reflection should be based on UQ employability framework SEAL (<strong>S</strong>ituation, <strong>E</strong>ffect, <strong>A</strong>ctions taken and <strong>L</strong>earning) reflection model. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The aim of this team assignment is for students to critically reflect on clinical experiences as a group, enabling peer to peer reflection as well as critical self reflection to understand skills and attributes needed to successfully gain the best effect in a work context. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The reflective process has the potential to enable early year health professional students to <strong>learn from their individual and group professional experiences</strong> to describe challenges encountered, explain the impact and actions taken to deal with the situation and explain what they can do in future situations in a similar context. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The assessment will be graded on <strong>the following criteria </strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Situation:</strong> Describe what happened during your chosen peer to peer clinic activity (Eg. Impressions, hand scaling) </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>2<strong>. Effect:</strong> List or explain any \"challenges faced\" and the impact they made on either the student operator, student assistant or student acting as patient. (Eg, Gag reflex during upper impression or breach in infection control observed, or limited mouth opening)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>3.<strong> Action: </strong>Explain the actions taken or strategies employed to deal with the challenge/s, and the rationale for taking the actions. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>4. <strong>Learning</strong>: Explain what was learnt from this case or patient interaction. The group must explain what they can now do as a result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do they need to do to handle a similar situation again in the future?</li>\n<li>How has the experience added to the ones the student has already had in terms of their professional development?</li>\n<li>Can they identify particular skills or personal attributes that they drew on in this situation?</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
