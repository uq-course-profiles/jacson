It should be developed enough that it is a fully functioning beta expression of your ideas. Its form will vary depending on the student and your interests, but it might be something like a podcast, or a prototype for wearable tech, or a 3d printed design and object, or an AR installation, or a game. You are only limited by the combination of your imagination, your skills, and your available time! Note that attendance in class and participation inp activities will be vital to developing an appropriate and manageable project.</p>\n<p>2) The video walkthrough should provide a <em>critical reflection</em> on the project, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creative concept and social context of the work</li>\n<li>The aesthetic and technical composition of the work</li>\n<li>The decisions that have been taken in the design process</li>\n<li>The work remaining and issues to be addressed before taking this project public</li>\n<li>The skills developed and lessons learned from designing this project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also your opportunity to explain how the project *ought* to work (even if it it doesn't yet) and your vision for it as a completed, professional piece of work.</p>\n<p>3) The KASE table is a reflection on the project and your process for developing and building it. KASE stands for Knowledge, Attributes, Skills, and Experiences; the table itself is 1-2 pages long, and populated by bullet points for each category (Knowledge: I <strong>know</strong> about... Experience: I <strong>am...</strong> etc.) Comprehensive examples will be provided in Blackboard for you to use as models, and we will spend time in class discussing the components.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
