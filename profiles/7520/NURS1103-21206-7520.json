The course requires successful completion of 80 hours of clinical placement. The following elements needed to be completed in order to evidence Clinical Placement Preparation and Performance:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Placement Readiness Plan</strong></p>\n<p>Within the first two days of clinical placement students will develop a Placement Plan (completed via ePAD). The overall aim of the placement plan is to support you to develop agency in your learning and consider how to integrate learning and feedback between different contexts. Through completing placement plans iteratively, you demonstrate your ability to take initiative to prepare for placement and review previous assessments to identify gaps or challenges which need further work as you progress towards working as a registered nurse. Information on how to complete your Placement Plan will be provided to you prior to starting placement.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Clinical Skills Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Within the first half of your clinical placement (prior to your Formative ANSAT) you will select <strong>one (1) </strong>foundational clinical skill and demonstrate it to your Buddy RN or Clinical Facilitator. You will demonstrate your ability to safely undertake this activity, and request feedback on your performance via ePAD. Information on how to complete your Clinical Skills Assessment will be provided to you prior to starting placement.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Self-evaluation of Nursing Standards of Practice</strong></p>\n<p>Immediately prior to undertaking your Formative ANSAT you will self-evaluate your performance against the NMBA Registered Nurse Standards for Practice (completed via ePAD). The aim of this task is to support your ability to evaluate your own performance through making comparisons of your work to that of your peers, supervisors and to the descriptions in the rubric. Through iterative engagement with the standards of practice, you will demonstrate your ability to actively seek and action feedback information and to persist despite the emotional challenges associated with engaging in constructive feedback. Information on how to complete your self-evaluation will be provided to you prior to starting placement.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Feedback and Action Plan</strong></p>\n<p>Immediately following your Formative ANSAT you will reflect on the feedback you have received and identify areas for improvement (completed via ePAD). The purpose of this task is to assess your capacity for self-reflection and ability to process feedback from various sources, to deeply engage with your level of knowledge and professional skills. Through reviewing your completed Formative ANSAT in ePAD, you will demonstrate your ability for accurate self-evaluation and showcase your proficiency in monitoring professional and clinical development over time, reflect on achievements, and identify areas for further growth. Information on how to complete this activity will be provided to you prior to starting placement.</p>\n<p>Students are to refer to the \"Assessment\" tab located within the NURS1103 Blackboard site for further details and specifications of the assessment item.</p>\n<p>Please note: falsification of any information pertaining to placement attendance or performance will be considered a breach of the UQ Student Code of Conduct Policy 3.60.01 (<a href=\"https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.60.01-student-code-conduct\">https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.60.01-student-code-conduct</a>).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
