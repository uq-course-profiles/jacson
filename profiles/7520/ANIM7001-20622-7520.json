This is due to the perceived higher impacts (particularly greenhouse gas emissions) of production of 1 kg of beef vs 1 kg of pork or chicken. However, beef is often produced using land or feed that cannot be utilised by humans whereas poultry or pork systems utilise grains and protein sources that may otherwise be used for human nutrition and may have other adverse impacts on the environment including on biodiversity. Please discuss the relative impacts of extensive beef production versus intensive monogastric systems.</p>\n<p>There are a number of journals you can use to explore this topic area such as: Animal Frontiers, Journal of Animal Science, Production Animal Science, Animals, Animal, International Journal of Biometeorology, Journal of Dairy Science – there are more!</p>\n<p>Resources will be available on the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>Scientific journal articles are to be used for the assignment – as a guide, about 20 scientific articles should be used.

For example, heat stress in dairy cows, welfare issues in free-range poultry, the impact of climate change on livestock production. It is your choice as to the topic area that you want to investigate, so really whatever you are interested in. Do not just focus on the examples. If you are not sure if the topic is relevant to please contact Dr Eyre for assistance. </p>\n<p>You are to find 2 recent articles (i.e. from the years 2020 to 2025), from the scientific literature (i.e. from journals e.g. International Journal of Biometeorology, Journal of Animal Science, Journal of Dairy Science, Animal Production Science) which discuss aspects of an issue related to animal production. The articles should be the published results of a study i.e. they will have an introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion. <strong><em>Do not use an article that is a discussion or review paper</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>For this assessment you are to: <strong>Identify how and why the research was carried out – and to critically review each paper (n=2).</strong></p>\n<p>Read the articles carefully and use the questions below to help you identify how and why the research was carried out.
