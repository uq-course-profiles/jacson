These exercises are aimed at introducing you to the uncertainty and challenges of research, whereby resilience is needed to troubleshoot and overcome challenges in experiments. This experience will introduce you to the foundations of scientific inquiry, from ideation and execution, through to analysis, interpretation and communication of findings, culminating in submission of a formal scientific report. You will be guided in all aspects of this semester-long learning process through resources, scaffolded activities and the mentorship of a tutor dedicated to your team. </p>\n<p>Although you will work as a team throughout the practical series, <strong>the scientific report you submit must be WHOLLY individual work</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the scientific communication of your experiment and outcomes (1500 words), your report will also include a 500-word Relevance section designed to prompt you to think about the relevance of your learning over the practical series, beyond the classroom.
