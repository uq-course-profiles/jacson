This should be submitted to the course tutor before the class and it will be projected to the class along with other students’ presentations for one-minute, during which time you should outline its key features. This will also allow you to practice developing and presenting this specific type of high-impact presentation to organisational decision makers. A couple of examples will provided in the first class, but these should not be taken as definitive models of how to do this exercise. Models of infographic design (and free samples of programmes to help create these) can be found on the internet (e.g., at canva.com).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Time allowed: 4 minutes</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It can take the form of either a formal report or an article for a professional magazine or blog (e.g., in the form of an article for <em>The Conversation</em>)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>First, choose a leadership issue as the focus of this assignment. For example, you might assess the leadership problems faced by a particular organization or in a particular sector. This should be an issue that you have, or can acquire, some distinctive knowledge about (either through personal experience, or research).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Second, you need to discuss some data relevant to the issue you are focusing on, analyse it, and draw appropriate conclusions — e.g., regarding practical ways to deal with a particular problem, or to move forward. Data here is broadly defined as any information, statistical or otherwise, pertinent to the issue you are exploring (e.g., data provided in an industry report; commentary on a leadership failure).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Word limit: </strong>1,200 words</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Late Assessment</strong>: Extensions for assignments will be granted only on the basis of a written application, accompanied by a medical certificate. Extensions cannot be applied for on the day or the day before the piece of assessment is due. It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is submitted on time. Assignments will lose 2 marks for each day late, including 2 marks for each day of the weekend or public holiday. Assignments submitted more than 2 weeks late will receive an automatic failure. There are no variations to these requirements.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>All assessment items must be attempted: It is a requirement of the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) of the Australian Psychological Society (APS) that the minimum pass mark for each and every assessment task relating to the Core Capabilities and Attributes for Psychologists is 50%. Thus, all assessment items for PSYC7594 must be attempted and receive a mark of at least 50% in order to pass the course. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
