Note: Audience is VERY important! You are expected to write in a genre appropriate for teachers: <strong>succinctly with clear language and formatting</strong>, keeping in mind that teachers are busy, intelligent and committed people.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Task</strong></p>\n<p>To complete this assignment, you will first need to find three digital resources from different sources, of varying quality, and in three different strands of mathematics that each focus on practical ideas for teaching or learning a specific mathematical topic taught in Years 7-12 (e.g., quadratic equations, visualising geometric transformations); if a resource is more general, you must find a way to highlight a specific topic within that resource.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part A</strong>. Critically evaluate the usefulness of each of the three resources in terms of addressing the principles of motivation, understanding and connection as outlined in the course. Justify your arguments with the lecture notes and course readings (300-500 words each).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part B</strong>. Select the best of the resources in Part A and use the Australian Curriculum to clearly identify a key concept within a grade level (Year 7-12) that the resource could be used to teach. Utilise relevant chapters of the Goos et al. (2017) text to identify and discuss difficulties that students are likely to face in learning this topic. Suggest teaching strategies for overcoming these difficulties (300-500 words).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part C</strong>. Upload a title, link, image and brief (~50 words) teacher-friendly overview of the selected digital resource (for teachers to skim and see if it’s relevant for their needs) into the appropriate area in the class wiki.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part D</strong>. Design a lesson (45-90 minutes) that incorporates the selected digital resource and capitalises on it in creative ways to promote student understanding of your selected content (two pages plus additional appendices if needed).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part E</strong>. <strong>To be completed 7-11 April</strong>. Select three resources from your peers’ submissions in the wiki that you consider to be exceptionally useful for teaching the content described in the overview and write a brief comment (~10-30 words) below each resource why you think the resource will be useful. (This is not used to mark the resources, just ensures that you LOOKED at the resources submitted.)</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Be sure to include approximate timelines for each phase or set of lessons (2-3 pages).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>3.   Describe or provide a final assessment task to be completed by students, identifying sources of evidence you will look for in student work and guidelines for teacher judgements (e.g. a list of criteria) (1-2 pages).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>4.   Provide a one-page justification of how the investigation: (i) embraces principles of mathematical understanding, connection and motivation; (ii) engages and scaffolds students who are disengaged or find mathematics difficult; (iii) differentiates learning of the identified mathematical content; (iii) promotes literacy and numeracy; and (iv) why the culminating assessment task is appropriate for this investigation.

Relate your strengths and areas to develop to how students learn and the implications as a secondary mathematics teacher. You must include three of these entries <strong>regularly spaced</strong> through the year: before first prac, between pracs and after second prac (aim for 100-200 words each).</p>\n<p>    <em>Part 2: Professional engagement</em>. Select an area to develop related to teaching mathematics and engage with a professional learning opportunity or community that will extend your background or confidence in this aspect of teaching. Explain your choice of engagement, describe your involvement and indicate how your learning inspired the focus of your article. Include a brief reflection on why continued professional learning is important and how engagement with professional associations and community groups can contribute to your practice as a teacher of secondary mathematics. (400-600 words as a single entry, identified as Part 2: Professional engagement).</p>\n<p>    <em> Part 3: Professional communication</em>. Write a 500-1500 word mathematics teacher magazine article based on a topic, experience or idea that is relevant to beginning teachers and was inspired by your reflection and/or engagement.
