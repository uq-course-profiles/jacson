In the first seminar, we will provide you with ten topics to choose from, and <strong>your team can choose any of the ten topics</strong> for your literature review paper which is also called \"<strong>semester paper</strong>\".</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, your semester paper should follow the format of a standard essay, which consists of three components: introduction, body<strong> </strong>and conclusion. The general guidelines for each section are summarised as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>introduction</strong>, you need to <strong>identify a specific (usually narrowly defined) topic</strong> for your paper and <strong>clearly define the scope of your literature review</strong> (e.g., limited to key papers published in the past decade, or to one or more specific industries). Importantly, you need to <strong>explain the main reason(s) for choosing the topic and indicate two or three major themes</strong> (or issues) identified through your literature research and analysis.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>body</strong> of the paper, you are advised to <strong>organise your review of the literature </strong>(including summary, critical evaluation and synthesis) <strong>around the two or three major themes </strong>(or issues)<strong> </strong>as indicated in your introduction based on a critical analysis of the important papers on your chosen topic. These two or three major themes (or issues) can form two or three sections in the body of your paper. Under each section, you will analyse and synthesise key research papers related to the corresponding theme (or issue).</li>\n<li>In the <strong>conclusion</strong> section, you need to <strong>summarize the main findings of your review</strong> on your chosen topic and briefly <strong>discuss</strong> the <strong>implications</strong> of these findings for research and/or practice. You will also consider identifying some unanswered research questions on the topic that need to be addressed in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is highly recommended that you <strong>read </strong>some well-structured and well-written<strong> literature review papers before</strong> writing your paper. In the fourth lecture, there will be a workshop on how to write your semester paper.<strong> </strong>Further details about this assessment will be included at our course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the main text of your semester paper should<strong> not exceed 2,000 words (excluding the title, abstract, tables (if any) and references)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The main purpose of this assessment is to allow you to demonstrate some <strong>insight </strong>into the course content and your learning experience.</p>\n<p>Reflections are <strong>more personal</strong> and <strong>introspective </strong>than standard academic essays, requiring <strong>a first-person account </strong>and <strong>critical analysis</strong> and <strong>interpretation</strong> of your learning experience in the course. Nonetheless, your reflection paper should have a similar structure to a standard essay, consisting of three parts, namely an introduction, body, and conclusion. Specifically, your reflection should include the following four sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>introduction</strong>, you should briefly provide key background information for your reflection (e.g., motivation for taking the course, objectives, etc.). You should also identify some key activities that you feel have been helpful to your learning this semester (e.g. case study discussions, guest lectures, etc.) and explain why?</li>\n<li>The <strong>main body</strong> consists of <strong>two sections</strong>, namely Section A and Section B. In <strong>Section A</strong>, you are required to identify <strong>two key topics</strong> (e.g., supply chain strategies, and supply chain integration and collaboration) you have come across during the semester and critically analyse how and why they have had a positive impact on your learning in relation to your <strong>knowledge base</strong>. These topics should be analysed by relating them to <strong>suitable cases</strong> discussed in the course and by referring to <strong>appropriate journal papers</strong> through literature research.</li>\n<li>In <strong>Section B</strong> of the main body, you need to identify <strong>some</strong> of the <strong>key learning activities</strong> you undertook (e.g., class discussions, skills development workshops from Weeks 2 to 4, case study workshops, group work, etc.) during the semester and critically analyse how and why they had a positive impact on your <strong>skill development</strong>.</li>\n<li>Finally, in the <strong>conclusion</strong> section, you are advised to consider <strong>summarising</strong> what you have learned about international supply chains and how your learning has changed your <strong>perspective</strong> on your chosen field of study and/or addressed a gap in your knowledge base, as well as how your learning experience has shaped your <strong>career aspirations</strong> or <strong>employability</strong> in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Week 13, there will be in-class discussions and consultations on writing issues related to critical reflection. Further details (including the marking criteria) about the assessment will be made accessible at our course Blackboard site in due course.</p>\n<p>NOTE: your reflection paper should <strong>not</strong> <strong>exceed 1,200 words (excluding the title page, references and appendices (if any)).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
