You are expected to reflect on how you can apply what you have learned in the course to your current assessment practice in your teaching or on how it can inform your future approach to testing and assessment.</li>\n<li>We would like you to spend about 10 minutes answering the following weekly questions after class. These are general guiding questions except Question 5. You are not expected to answer each question but summarise the topic presented in a particular week, including your answer to Question 5 approximately. Your reflection should be <strong>thoughtful and insightfu</strong>l (try to avoid being too descriptive) <strong>but succinct </strong>(approximately 150-200 words).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Questions about course content</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the most critical/surprising/memorable thing you learned during this week's seminar?</li>\n<li>What was something you already knew or had learned but was reinforced in the seminar?</li>\n<li>What is your current belief about testing and assessment in language teaching and learning?

This assessment aims to enhance your group working skills and test development capabilities. Your evaluation will be based on the completed test and assessment items (worth 35 points) and the poster presentation of the test at the end of the semester during Weeks 12-13 (worth 5 points).</p>\n<p><strong>A. Submission guidelines</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Materials</strong> you must submit for this assessment consist of nine separate components.</p>\n<p><strong>1.    Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief overview of the test context, including details on intended test takers, their proficiency levels, learning environment (e.g., secondary, primary, university, private language school), and the textbook chapter used as the basis for test development. Provide information beneficial for other educators interested in replicating the test.</li>\n<li>Rationale for test content, addressing what to include in the test (test content) and how to administer it. While detailed summaries aren't necessary, ensure there is enough explanation to understand the rationale behind your design decisions. If applicable, reference the \"Checklist for evaluating usefulness\" (Bachman &amp; Palmer, 1996).</li>\n<li>Brief report on pilot testing, outlining any adjustments made to the test content following pilot testing. Expected length: 2-3 pages (1.5/double spacing, 12-point font specified below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.    Test Items (Test Paper):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design test papers considering length, ensuring they align with seminar discussions. Larger groups are expected to produce more test items.</li>\n<li>Ensure the test assesses communicative language ability rather than discrete grammar knowledge. Tasks should simulate real-life scenarios for test-takers to engage with.</li>\n<li>Present the test well-organised to leave a positive impression on test-takers. Consolidate all test items assessing different skills into one document.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3.    Guidelines for Test Users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide instructions for test administrators and assessors to ensure consistent administration and assessment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.    Test Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blueprint of the test, referencing provided sample specifications and discussing them in seminars. Share your specifications with a classmate (not in your group) to gauge their ability to create a different test version using your blueprint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.    Additional Materials:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include supplementary materials like listening texts/transcripts, speaking task cards, and marking sheets (distinct from marking guidelines provided in item 3).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.    Textbook Chapter:</strong>     </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission of the textbook chapter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7. Group Declaration of Equitable Contribution:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each group member must declare their contribution to the project, acknowledging any discrepancies in participation that may impact individual marks negatively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>8.     References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>List all sources used in the project, ensuring proper acknowledgement and formatting. Use APA 7th style.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>9.     Poster:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare a poster for the presentation scheduled for weeks 12-13.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. Style of Project report</strong></p>\n<p>Items 1, 7, and 8 above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Font type and size – Times New Roman/Arial, 12 point</li>\n<li>Margin – 2.5cm for all (left, right, top and bottom)</li>\n<li>Referencing – APA 7th style</li>\n<li>Space – 1.5 or double spacing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All other items:</p>\n<p>While you can choose your formatting style, please ensure all materials are meticulously formatted and aesthetically pleasing. Remember, these materials represent you as a professional and The University of Queensland student.</p>\n<p><strong>C. Criteria &amp; Marking:</strong></p>\n<p>Completed projects must be submitted by 1 pm on Friday, 9 May, via a link on the course Blackboard site. Each group is required to make a single submission. Poster presentations will be conducted during class seminars in weeks 12-13. Additional instructions on poster presentations will be provided during workshops. Please refer to the rubric below for a detailed breakdown of the marking criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test Rationale (25%)</li>\n<li>Test Items (25%)</li>\n<li>Additional test materials (administration, assessment, listening texts, task card for speaking test, marking sheet (12.5%)</li>\n<li>Test specification (12.5%)</li>\n<li>Document formatting (12.5%)</li>\n<li>Poster (12.5%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment is a group endeavour, meaning all group members receive the same score. Therefore, successful completion of the assessment requires active collaboration among group members. Suppose a group member fails to attend class on the poster presentation day or contributes inadequately to the project design. In that case, they may be removed from the group and asked to apply for an extension to complete the assessment independently.

Argumentative Essay</strong></p>\n<p><em>“to use what is known about a subject to prove an argument or point of view. Not all of the topic knowledge may be used in an essay, but only what is relevant to the argument. In an essay, mentioning the people who discovered or developed the knowledge is generally only for referencing purposes.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Relying upon literature, theories introduced in the course, and your experiences, your essay should include the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear thesis statement</li>\n<li>Discussion on the relevant theory.</li>\n<li>The type of research that has been done to investigate the topic you chose.</li>\n<li>Critical analyses of the research studies about your chosen topic.</li>\n<li>The conclusions or results obtained from these studies and how they might relate to the theories discussed in the course and your understanding and experience of the topic.</li>\n<li>Suggestions and discussions of options and alternatives that may have practical applications, for example, in the classroom. When you include your understanding and experiences, you should go beyond just your “personal thoughts” but rather explore and examine the topic as you have come to understand it from the materials provided in the course in addition to your journey in learning your L1, L2, or L3, and teaching etc. When appropriate, give examples to support your arguments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The research literature on your chosen topic, complemented by course material, lecture notes, discussions, tutorials, and own experience</strong></p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Topic “Assessment of Communicative Language Ability”. You can build your argument based on what the literature says about the topic. If you decide to discuss the subject based on whether you agree or disagree with the premise, you are welcome to do that. Whichever way you choose to discuss and analyse, it should be well supported by literature and course materials and your observations and experiences. The arguments should cohere and follow logically.</p>\n<p>More on the assessment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An argumentative essay should include different points of view regarding the topic.</li>\n<li>You support one idea referring to the literature.</li>\n<li>The structure of the argumentative essay is held together by</li>\n<li>a clear, concise, and defined thesis statement that occurs in the essay's first paragraph.</li>\n<li>Clear and logical transitions between the introduction, body, and conclusion.</li>\n<li>Body paragraphs that include evidential support.</li>\n<li>A conclusion that does not simply restate the thesis but readdresses it considering the evidence provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>C. Submission guidelines</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Style and presentation guidelines</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Font and Font size – Times New Roman/Arial, 12 point</li>\n<li>Margin – 2.5cm for all (left, right, top and bottom)</li>\n<li>Referencing – APA style (APA 7th)</li>\n<li>Space – 1.5 or double spacing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment is marked out of 35 points.</p>\n<p>Your essay should be around <strong>2,500 words</strong> (+/- 250 words, not including references).
