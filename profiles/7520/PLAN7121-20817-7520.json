There are different stages/elements in a CEP. It is suggested that you follow the structure provided by State of Queensland (2017, 13-14). You need to write the report as if the group will be consultants and no work on this project has been done. This means that the proposal does not necessarily need to follow how the engagement for the case study has been done so far in practice. The case study will be the proposals for the Toowong-West End and St Lucia-West End Green Bridges, by Brisbane City Council (BCC). Each group needs to decide which of the two bridges will be analysed and work only on that proposal.</p>\n<p>In preparation for this assignment, we will do a field visit to the two sites proposed for the construction of these bridges. External students will be able to watch a video of this visit. The video is pre-recorded and will contain important material that you can use in the assignment. Your analysis will be done using ideas, concepts and tools discussed in the course in relation to community participation in planning and the case study. You are expected to use academic literature to provide information on the case study and justify your decisions in the CEP. </p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment tasks prohibiting use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
