The week in which you will present will be assigned in your first tutorial. Your presentation should be around 5 minutes long. Presentations run from Week 2 to Week 13. A written reflection about your presentation must be submitted via Turnitin on Blackboard within one week, before your next tutorial. You will find your <strong>submission link</strong> is in your Assessment 2 folder. Your reflection should provide a summary of your presentation, and a reflection on what you learned from making your poster and presenting it to the class.    </p>\n<p>You will be assessed on <strong>the quality and creativity of your digital poster and reflection</strong>.  </p>\n<p><strong>Digital Poster Presentations:</strong></p>\n<p>Poster presentations are a common form of presentation in which a speaker refers to a poster of their own design to explain or summarise a topic or issue in front of a small live audience. For this assignment, you will create a poster—<strong>one slide only</strong>—that illustrates or summarises one of the week’s readings or topics. You will give a short oral presentation in class that discusses and explains your poster. Your poster can include examples not discussed in class so long as they are relevant to the topic. Your presentation should be lively and interactive. The class will be encouraged to ask interested questions and engage with your presentation. You can use notes, but reading a script is discouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>You must email your slide to your tutor the day before your tutorial, to prevent technical issues</strong>.  </p>\n<p><strong>Written Reflections:</strong></p>\n<p>Your reflection should provide a summary of your presentation, and a reflection on what you learned from making your poster and presenting it to the class. Reflections should be ~500 words, and uploaded via Turnitin. Reflections are due within one week of your presentation, before the following tutorial. They should be well written and fully referenced.    </p>\n<p><strong>AI/MT Policy:</strong></p>\n<p>For this assignment, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies may be used in the design of your digital poster, and the images used. AI may not be used in your written reflection. Your written reflection evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of AI. Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to write their reflections is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
