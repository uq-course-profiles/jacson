These include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly tasks are due each Wednesday at 5pm, (including in-class work for the previous week and pre-class work for that week) from Week 2 to 7 via Padlet.</li>\n<li>Final Submission (26%) - The weekly tasks are compiled into a final submission work (inclusive of week 7's in-class activities) due on Friday of Week 7 by 5pm via Turnitin on Blackboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.
