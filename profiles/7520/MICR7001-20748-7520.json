With the explosion of next generation sequencing, culture-independent methods have become accessible for identifying the population of bacteria at a very deep level. The purpose of this assessment item is to examine your ability to analyse, using culture-independent analysis methods, the bacterial populations in foods and to interpret the results. An introduction lecture will be given in the tutorial session and several examples of research papers using this technique in foods will be provided. </p>\n<p>You will be given a set of data and information which you will analyse and provide a summary of the results in a report. You will also interpret the results in the wider field of food microbiology and cite relevant references. The samples you will be provided will be from different foods at different stages of shelf-life which have undergone different treatments. The word limit and specific details of the assessment will be provided in the tutorial class. You will have time during the tutorials to carry out this analyses and write the report. You may ask the lecturer for guidance/assistance during these sessions.</p>\n<p>While you can work in a small group, a report describing the work and analysis of results <strong>will be submitted by individual students (not a group). </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Any copying of text from other sources, including other student's reports, will be considered plagiarism and reported to the School Integrity Officer.</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
