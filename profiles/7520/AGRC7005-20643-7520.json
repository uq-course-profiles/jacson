The Minister is concerned that the local agriculture may not be sustainable, and asked you to develop a strategy for the development of more sustainable agriculture. The location is a sub-tropical to upper temperate region (You need to choose and specify the location/region that you are focussing on, such as southern Queensland), with distinct seasonal differences in weather, and some areas are based on annual crops while others are on perennial crops. By examining the situation further it is realized that the existing system is unsustainable in the long term either because of difficulty in maintaining high crop yield or due to major economic (eg, high labour cost) and environmental (eg, soil erosion) issues. It is thus required to examine the possibility of changing from the established practices to a different system of production. (The proponents of change are aware of the social dimension of sustainability but this aspect is beyond the scope of the present consultancy request.)</p>\n<p><strong>Needs to be considered: </strong></p>\n<p>If your chosen region was southern Queensland,</p>\n<p>·      Summer crops are summer cereals (maize and grain sorghum), cotton and occasionally soybeans, peanuts, mungbeans or sunflowers</p>\n<p>·      Winter crops are wheat, barley, chickpeas and mungbeans</p>\n<p>·      Perennials may be sugarcane or fruit crops.</p>\n<p>You need to choose the summer-winter annual cropping system and then define the agronomic system that is likely to be sustainable. Your tasks as a senior agronomist are to:</p>\n<p><strong>i) </strong>Evaluate the sustainability of the existing system and comment on the</p>\n<p>Minister’s concern.</p>\n<p><strong>ii) </strong>Identify aspects of the existing system that lead to lack of sustainability from</p>\n<p>crop production, economic and environmental viewpoints.</p>\n<p><strong>iii) </strong>Establish production and resource management objectives that a revised system</p>\n<p>of production should meet.</p>\n<p><strong>iv) </strong>Assess alternative production systems that may be adopted in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>v) </strong>Recommend an alternative agronomic system and describe sequence/s of production of</p>\n<p>the range of crops you propose.</p>\n<p><strong>vi) </strong>Provide guidelines to the process of implementation of the revised system.</p>\n<p><strong>vii) </strong>Provide guidelines to the assessment of the effectiveness of the revised system</p>\n<p>in meeting the objectives proposed in (<strong>iii</strong>) above. </p>\n<p>Your presentation will be assessed based on the content for each of the tasks mentioned above. The assessment and marking criteria used for this course is on the blackboard site:- Seminar Marking criteria.pdf.</p>\n<p><strong>Submission: </strong>All students should submit their presentations (Powerpoint file) electronically via the Assessment link/Presentations Case study 1on the Blackboard site. Ensure that your name/student number is incorporated in the filename of the document.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Notes</strong></p>\n<p>This task requires <strong>critical evaluation and original thought</strong>. AI tools can assist with research, but your interpretation, analysis, and recommendations must be unique and justified. Presentations that rely solely on generic AI-generated content <strong>without data interpretation or real-world engagement</strong> will receive lower grades.</p>\n<p>By completing this task, you will develop essential communication skills in <strong>delivering complex scientific information concisely and persuasively</strong>—a key skill for agronomists in the field. Good luck! </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
