The focus of this course is on the application of research skills to complete a small scale research project. The major and final assessment of the course is pulling together what you have done across the two semesters into a final research report. The report must communicate clearly the purpose, the research process and the main findings of the study, the evidence that supports the findings and the implications of the findings. Demonstrated knowledge of research processes, principles and language is a key criterion of this assessment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Task Description</strong></p>\n<p>Each student will submit a final report of 6000-8000 words. Please note that a word count that is outside this range by 10%, either 10% less than 6000 words, or 10% more than 8000 words will incur a reduction of 10% of the total mark available for the assessment.</p>\n<p>The report will draw on and develop the original research proposal submitted in Semester 1 and will include the data collection tool that was approved by the Low and Negligible Risk (LNR) Human Research Ethics Committee. In addition, information relating to sampling, the experience of data collection, the analysis, discussion and implications will be incorporated. There is opportunity to use the feedback from the conference presentation to improve the report.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
