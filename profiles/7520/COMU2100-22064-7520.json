You <strong>must</strong> consult the full assignment description on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>For this assessment, you’ll perform an extended analysis of a<em> </em>video game of your choosing. You *must* discuss your choice of game with your tutor well in advance of the deadline, and it should be a game you are very familiar with *and* have easy access to. This tasks requires you to create a video featuring visuals of gameplay elements, and a voiceover that provides your critical commentary. You may use some still images in the video, but you must use at least some game play footage as well. The gameplay video *must* be your own. Your voiceover should provide a detailed analysis of the visuals, and should draw on the tools and methods we have been studying in class. This task requires that you go well beyond <strong>description</strong> (e.g., what is happening in the game) and instead focus on <strong>analysis </strong>(e.g., what it <em>means</em>, how it <em>works</em>, why it <em>matters</em>, etc.). A solid analysis will combine: 1) medium-specific and genre-specific reading practices; 2) critical theories and methods appropriate to the game; 3) a clear definition of the concept(s) that it is using. </p>\n<p>Students must upload the video, and a complete text transcript of the voiceover, via Blackboard.</p>\n<p>A full description, including referencing requirements for AI tools and a comprehensive grading rubric, is available in Blackboard at learn.uq.edu.au.
