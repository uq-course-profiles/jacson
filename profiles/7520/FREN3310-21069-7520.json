If your source text is over the required length of 500 to 600 words, highlight or explain the selection which you will translate. Emailing a link to the text is not sufficient: please provide a PDF or scan of the source text. If a known English translation already exists, you must justify your choice.

Workshop of Final Translation Project</strong></p>\n<p>Due Date: <strong>8 May in class (Week 10)</strong></p>\n<p>Task Description: Arrive in class with the source text and the printed draft of your final project, with a minimum of 400 words translated. Word count should be visible on your printed copy. Identify at least two specific questions or problems related to your project and potential solutions. Participate in group workshopping of translation projects and give feedback to your peers for submission with their final draft.</p>\n<p><strong>III. Final Translation Project Submission </strong></p>\n<p>Due Date: <strong>16 May 17:00 (Week 11)</strong></p>\n<p>Task Description: You will produce a full translation into English of a French Source Text (500-600 words), accompanied by a commentary (450-650 words) in either English or French. </p>\n<p>The translation must be “publication-ready”, i.e. it should not contain elements of indecision (e.g. ellipses where you could not arrive at a suitable translation; alternate choices where you could not decide between possibilities…). </p>\n<p>The commentary will provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>full bibliographic information and a general overview of the Source Text including the genre and/or style of the text;</li>\n<li>a description of the strategic approach required to produce the Target Text in which you identify the purpose and readership of the TT, any special areas of knowledge required, and specific priorities you set;</li>\n<li>a detailed analysis of 3 specific translation issues identified in your project. You should focus on salient features discussed in class such as translation units, idiomatic expressions, calques, borrowing, generic conventions, cultural considerations, etc. and use the correct translation vocabulary to do so. Explain how your choices were determined. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also wish to provide a conclusion that is based on preceding discussion and indicate future avenues for this work. </p>\n<p><strong>Electronic submission: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit your assignment electronically via Turnitin, in one Word document. Format your document in two sections. Section one will contain the Source Text and Target Text, presented as parallel texts in two columns. Section two will contain your commentary. </li>\n<li>For the purposes of the parallel texts (which facilitate both final proofing, for you, and marking, for your lecturer) copy relevant text only (no images) from the Source Text into the left-hand column. The Source Text itself must not be altered in any way. </li>\n<li>The submitted Source Text approved by the coordinator in week 7 will be the official reference point for the marking of your Target Text, in the event that images, tables or other any non-textual information need to be consulted; or in the event of discrepancies between the approved version and the parallel text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking: </strong></p>\n<p>The translation component and the commentary will each count for 50% of the marks for this task. The translation and commentary criteria are the same as for other work in this course. </p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
