(d) what is the impact of the trends/issues identified in (a) with respect to the individuals/groups chosen as your focus?</p>\n<p>It is essential that you link your ideas not only to the course readings, but wider readings relevant to your chosen focus.

Students may approach the assignment in many different ways - so your introduction must clearly set out the focus and scope of your paper for the reader. The assignment must also clearly demonstrate deep engagement with relevant literature and not be too anecdotal.</p>\n<p>You will need to select one of the issues covered in the course (or more if related).

A possibility would be to talk with a senior person in your organisation and discuss the particular focus/issues you have chosen to look at in-depth. You would then need to critically analyse their ideas using the relevant literature. Alternatively, you might like to use your own situation as a point of analysis for your paper.</p>\n<p>It will be essential that you include a detailed discussion of the literature relevant to the issue(s)/ focus you have chosen (Course Readings and wider) and use this literature in your analysis. You should also include some discussion of the implications of some of the key points of your discussion for leaders in education (and educational leadership more generally) e.g., what might be some of the particular challenges facing leaders as a result of leading/managing in an organisation in response to the particular issue(s)/focus you have identified for discussion.</p>\n<p>Further support/guidelines for this assignment will be provided during the semester.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
