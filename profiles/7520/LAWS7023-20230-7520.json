The two (2) marks will be allocated for the identification and treatment of the issues relevant to the solution of each submission.This assessment requires students to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of relevant law through their written communciation and analyse and apply critical thinking skills to produce an IL&amp;AC answer. Students must carefully analyse and solve IL&amp;AC problem questions, clearly justifying their answers, a skill that can be transferred to many areas in future careers. Students must make a serious and reasonable attempt to answer each ATs and further grading information will be made available on the course Blackboard website and further details about the ATS will be provided in tutorials and on Blackboard during the semester.</p>\n<p>Please take note of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The answer for each ATS will be discussed in the relevant Tutorial itself. Tutorials are not recorded and whilst brief guidelines about the answer to each submission will be released at the end of each week, these guidelines will not be a full and formative answer to a submission - students must attend the scheduled tutorials during the semester each week to obtain the full benefit of the discussion since this will aid them in their understanding of both the subject material and answer technique;</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, a mark out of 10 will be given to each student if, in the overall judgement of the course coordinator, the grading criteria set out in the CP have been satisfied.</li>\n<li>Student answers to these submissions must be typed (in Word) or hand-written and scanned (see the course blackboard website for further detail) and must be submitted electronically in the relevant submission folder in the course Blackboard site.
