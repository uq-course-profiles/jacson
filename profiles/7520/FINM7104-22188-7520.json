The quantification of a size risk premium was originally documented in academic studies in the early 1980’s (see, for example Banz 1981 and Keim 1983), which reported that stocks with small market capitalisations beat large stocks by more than market beta could explain. This was a noteworthy discovery, as it was arguably the first substantive challenge to CAPM theory.  </p>\n<p>Given its significance in the academic field and wide application in practice, as evidenced by the proliferation of small-cap investment funds, this assessment asks you to evaluate the efficacy of the size effect in generating excess returns.   </p>\n<p>Your evaluation should weigh heavily on the necessity of an idea or hypothesis as the foundation of a strategy, and the process of observation to ensure that strategies are robust and implementable. Additionally, you should consider how to determine genuine value in your discoveries and accurately assess your findings while avoiding misleading information, and outline lessons that need to be carried forward.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
