The word count could be less if the research outcomes are largely graphical or numerical, as agreed with the advisor. Apart from text, the Thesis may contain drawings, data, models, images, video and other media as agreed with the advisor. The Thesis may develop research previously conducted for other 2-unit MArch Research courses; however, the expectation is that prior work has been reconsidered and reframed in the thesis, not reproduced verbatim. The thesis should represent a substantial new body of work. No more than 20% of the text can be repeated from earlier submissions. The Thesis should contain a section headed “Prior research included in this Thesis” identifying any sections that draw on research conducted prior to enrolling in ADPS7060 and any prose sections that have been submitted for a previous course.</p>\n<p>The Thesis should be presented as a PDF document suitable to be printed at A4 either portrait or landscape format, or A3 landscape format. If the thesis includes video or 3D models embedded in the PDF, make sure to also include 2D still images of this material in case of future media incompatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Formative Feedback:</strong> You should be meeting and discussing drafts regularly with your advisor(s) during teaching weeks. Formative feedback is in Week 10 of Semester 1 2025, prior to which a draft chapter should be submitted directly to your advisor for feedback. </p>\n<p>Following the examination of the thesis, students will be required to make any recommended corrections or amendments to the satisfaction of the supervisor and course coordinator, and may choose to upload the corrected thesis to e-space.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
