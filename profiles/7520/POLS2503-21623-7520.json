Visualising Resistance</strong><br/><p>In this seminar, the third of three seminars on alternative approaches to nonviolence, we discuss the visual character of resistance. Focussing on street protests, we will see how the visual character of such events are not an historical given, nor is it a universal feature of protest. We will also think about representation and the different levels at which the visual plays a role in protest: in the street, in the media, in our imagination.</p></p></div></td>",
