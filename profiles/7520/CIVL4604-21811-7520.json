The abstract needs to be informative and concise so that readers can well understand your research without reading the whole report ).</li>\n<li><strong>Introduction </strong>– Describe the background of the research area (e.g., industry sector/natural environments, use numbers to emphasise the significance of the industry/environment, how it is operated/functioning), then narrow down the identified issues of the research area and the importance of solving the issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Literature review </strong>– Use your own words (rather than copy their abstract) to review and comment on how the previous studies were carried out to address the identified issues, list the key research gaps of the past studies, and the hypothesis and the objectives of the study that can fill these gaps.</li>\n<li><strong>Research methods </strong>– Introduce the research tools used in the study (e.g., fieldwork, lab experiment, mathematical modelling or database). Use your own words to describe the procedures of the study (e.g., experimental steps, pre and post-process data). List the solutions used to fix any issues found during the studies (e.g., water leaking, missing data).</li>\n<li><strong>Results and discussion </strong>– Use tables and figures to detail the findings of your study, and use text to highlight the key information in the tables and figures. The discussion summarises all the findings presented by the tables and figures and compares the overall findings with previous studies.</li>\n<li><strong>Conclusion </strong>– Summaries the background, gaps, method and findings. Note that the conclusion is not a repetition of the abstract as it emphasises more on the significance of the research background, the implications of your study, the limitations of this study, and the recommendation on how future studies should be conducted.</li>\n<li><strong>References </strong>– list all of the references cited in the main content.</li>\n<li><strong>Appendix (Optional) </strong>– Place computer codes, large tables or figures generated by your research. Most of the reviewers would not read your appendix unless your argument in the main contents is not clear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there are overlaps between the Progress Report and the Final Report, such as the Introduction and Literature Review, the Final Report is expected to address these sections in greater depth than the Progress Report.</p>\n<p>A template of the Final Report and past example reports are provided in the Blackboard learning resources.  The <strong>suggested length of the Final Report's Main Content</strong>, excluding tables of contents, references, and appendices is around <strong>30 pages</strong> for this <strong>four-unit two-semester course (CIVL4606).</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
