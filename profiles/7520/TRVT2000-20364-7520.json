Likewise, the planning and feedback from Assessment Task 2 will be used by you to develop Assessment Task 3. <strong>Therefore, it is important that you choose a scenario, as per the criteria below, that is of interest to you.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>\n<p>You are in a management position at a privately owned company that manages a tourist attraction(s) and/ or event(s). As a manager of this company, you are one of a number of people on the Executive Committee. Your company has been very successful over recent years but you have some concerns that the Committee is starting to get a bit complacent and is losing sight of the bigger picture. You have been doing some part time study and you have been learning about tourism systems. Leiper's Tourism System (LTS) stood out to you as a good model to apply to <strong>one</strong> tourist attraction <strong>or</strong> event that your company manages.</p>\n<p>Your choice of one tourist attraction or event must be a small to medium enterprise (SME).<strong> NOTE: </strong>Mega events like the Olympics and tourist attractions like Disneyland are too big and are therefore <strong>not suitable</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Tasks 1, 2 and 3: IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>Through your three (3) assessment tasks this semester, you will need to justify to the Executive Committee the benefits of applying LTS to your chosen tourist attraction or event. This is how the three tasks link together:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With Assessment Task 1 (Proposal), you will get feedback as you start to develop your ideas (i.e., before you need to present this to the Executive Committee).</li>\n<li>With Assessment Task 2 (System), you will provide a recorded (and scripted) powerpoint presentation for the Committee.</li>\n<li>With Assessment Task 3 (Transport Sub System Report), you will provide additional information as requested by the Committee.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>When choosing a tourist attraction or event, therefore, please note:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The tourist attraction or event you choose needs to be real.</strong> It should be an attraction or event that you are familiar with and/or that you have visited.</li>\n<li>Each student must have a <strong>different tourist attraction or event.</strong> Therefore, the quicker you select and confirm your tourist attraction or event with your tutor, the better chance you will have of getting your choice of attraction or event. An updated list will be managed by the tutors and made available on Blackboard throughout the semester.  </li>\n<li>The <strong>management company</strong> you are representing <strong>does not need to be real</strong>, but it can be the company that owns the tourist attraction or event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assessment Task 1: Presentation - Tourism System Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Your challenge is that other members of the Committee do not have a shared understanding of Leiper's Tourism System. Before you take your ideas to the Committee, you decide to run them past your lecturer and classmates to get some feedback. You have been given 2 (maximum 3) minutes to do a brief in-person presentation to the class.</p>\n<p><strong>Your presentation must include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a brief description of the tourist attraction or event your company is managing;</li>\n<li>identification of one (1) target market and its generating region;</li>\n<li>a description of the transit region;</li>\n<li>a description of the destination region.</li>\n<li>only one (1) powerpoint slide for your presentation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your one (1) powerpoint slide will be submitted via the course Blackboad site a day before your presentation.</li>\n<li>As per UQ Business School expectations, all presentations will be recorded for assessment purposes only. They will not be made available for other students to view.</li>\n<li>Your presentation will have a peer reviewed component which means you must be in attendance and provide feedback for all presentations in your tutorial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hint:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use your 2 (maximum 3) minutes well. You will need to be clear, concise and well rehearsed.</li>\n<li>We will discuss presentation expectations and marking criteria early in the semester (Week 2 and 3 tutorials).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
