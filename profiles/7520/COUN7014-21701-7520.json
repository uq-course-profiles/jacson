Note: It is not necessary that there is an extensive literature on your area of interest; however, you do need there to be enough empirical/scholarly literature for you to meet the requirements of the assessment as outlined below.</p>\n<p><strong>3.     Confirm your choice with your tutor.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The professional fact sheet should include:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·  </strong>A title</p>\n<p>·  A scholarly overview of empirical knowledge relevant to this area of loss– e.g., Why is the topic important? How prevalent is it? Why does the counsellor need to know about it?</p>\n<p>·  A list of signs, symptoms, reactions relevant to that loss.
