An individual roster for experiments will be provided in Week 2 of semester. All students start with Experiment 1. Prior to commencing at experiment students must complete the pre-work through Blackboard, prepare a flow-chart for their experiment and note the most significant hazards.</p>\n<p>ALL EXPERIMENTS MUST BE COMPLETED TO ACHIEVE A PASSING GRADE IN THIS COURSE. (Please refer to Section 5.4).</p>\n<p>Each lab report/results sheet is due to be submitted one hour prior to commencing the next scheduled experiment. For example, if an experiment with a lab report commences on Wednesday at 10 a.m. it is due the following Wednesday at 9 a.m (subject to public holidays and mid-semester break). If an experiment with a lab report was commenced at 2 p.m. Thursday, it is due the following Thursday at 1 p.m (subject to public holidays and mid-semester break). If a report/results sheet were to be due on either a public holiday or in mid-semester break it is due the next \"regular\" day of semester.</p>\n<p>Individual schedules for each student will be provided by lab staff in Week 2 of semester.</p>\n<p>Note that some weeks include public holidays.</p>\n<p>Late penalties will be applied in accordance with the UQ policy.</p>\n<p>All work submitted by students must be their own work. For further details please see the University policy on Plagiarism and student misconduct, Section 6.1.</p>\n<p>In particular, each student is responsible for generating their own structure drawings and mechanisms using ChemDraw. These files must not be shared with other students.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Absence from a Practical Session</strong></p>\n<p>You must attend 100 % of the laboratory component of this course.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to attend your timetabled practical session due to circumstances beyond your control (e.g. illness) you must submit a practical absence request immediately accompanied by acceptable supporting documentation.
