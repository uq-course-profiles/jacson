This assessment item has 2 components – one requiring reflection, the other planning by presenting early ideas.</p>\n<p>Task: Prepare a 7-minute (+/- 30 seconds) video including 2 components of roughly similar length.</p>\n<p>Component A: Reflect upon your engagement with the conflict resolution field thus far in the course. Include your (initial) reactions to the conflict resolution field as covered in the course thus far. What attracts or interests you to the conflict resolution field, what misgivings or concerns you have about it, what has surprised or confused you thus far, and/or what key questions you have? You might consider comparing what you are learning in the course with approaches to conflict that you have learnt or encountered in other courses or parts of your life. In completing part A, you should refer to your interpretation of key conflict resolution principles, the approach of the conflict resolution field, and/or the qualities and characteristics of a third party intervenor.</p>\n<p>Component B: After reviewing the guidance on conflict scenarios file (in the assessment folder for this item and for the Conflict Analysis Presentation and Discussion: Oral examination) present your initial or early thoughts about the conflict scenario that you will choose or develop for the conflict analysis and conflict resolution design assessment items. You should briefly note the conflict case and conflict parties, explain why you are interested in this case, and conclude by stating your understanding of the opening/possibility for negotiation in this case. NB: if you plan to develop or modify one of the ‘generic scenarios’ you should prepare a rough draft of your conflict scenario for this component. If you are choosing one of the ‘generic scenarios’ you may focus more of your time on explaining your interpretation of the scenario.</p>\n<p>Prepare your recording through the EchoVideo video server by following these instructions: <a href=\"https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-original/echovideo-original/submit-video-assignment-echovideo-original\">Submit a video assignment with EchoVideo (Original) - eLearning - University of Queensland</a></p>\n<p>Begin your video by clearly introducing yourself and the focus of your video: \"Hello, my name is XXX and in this video, I am going to discuss ABC\".</p>\n<p>The submission link is in the relevant assessment folder.</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:</p>\n<p>· You do not need to reference academic or professional literature in your video, but you should make clear that you have knowledge of these materials, and you can informally reference a source by giving basic details for it (author and title).</p>\n<p>· Prepare a script or (at least) clear notes before you deliver your presentation to camera. It is common for people to believe that they can simply ‘talk’ without preparation, but this rarely works.</p>\n<p>· Do not aim for perfection. It can be tempting to re-record to eliminate errors, but it is natural that your video recording has some minor errors in it (you do not need to produce a newsreader or studio quality video).</p>\n<p>· Observe the video length limit.</p>\n<p>· See the criteria sheet for further information.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

For this assessment, the course coordinator will represent your team.</p>\n<p>You will be allocated an approximate time between 1 and 5pm to meet with the coordinator for a presentation and conversation about your analysis. You should bring a paper copy of your proposed conflict scenario and prepare to provide an overview of your conflict analysis for 4-5 minutes (an alarm will sound at 4.30). After you present, you will be asked follow-up questions that will be intended to allow you to a) amplify/clarify your answer to demonstrate your knowledge and capacities and b) assist you to prepared for the follow-on Conflict Resolution Design assessment item. You should limit your answers to a maximum of approximately 2 minutes.</p>\n<p>Please note: None of the questions will be intended to trick or intimidate, and your grade can only improve through the conversation (i.e. your presentation will set a ‘floor’ and the final grade will then be higher or the same, not lower). </p>\n<p>Your overview of your conflict analysis should include (but need not be limited to): key context/s; key players/parties; issues and key causes (structural, proximate, triggering), and key dynamics/patterns. You may refer to slides, handouts or similar materials if you wish, but these are not required.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.’ I’ve made that change in this version.</p>\n<p>Please Note: You must receive a pass in the Conflict Analysis Presentation and Discussion assessment to pass this course. Students who do not receive a pass for Conflict Analysis Presentation and Discussion can only receive an overall grade of 3 or less for the course. Students who receive an overall score of 3 in the Course are eligible to apply for a supplementary assessment (my.uq <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/supplementary-assessment\">Supplementary Assessment</a>)</p>\n<p>The conversation will be recorded. This assessment item will be marked as an oral examination.
