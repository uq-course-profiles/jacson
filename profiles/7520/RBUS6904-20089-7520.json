This means that students will develop research questions, write a proposal for formative feedback, collect data (using interviewing and one other method), compose research memos, analyse data, and present their findings to the class. The goal is for students to gain an understanding of qualitative research through research experiences. <strong>This assessment has three components:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pilot research description (10%) </strong>describes the purpose and goals of the pilot project including introducing and contextualising the study, a brief description of the conceptual framework and explanation of the qualitative research methodology and design. By Week 7 students should be organised and focused on their pilot project research and decided on the methods being used in the pilot to generate data. Students are required to complete TWO interviews, plus ONE other data collection method. This formative assessment gives students an opportunity to get feedback on important research activities including statement of Research Questions and alignment with sampling strategy, interview guide development and ethics documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Research presentation (30%)</strong> will be completed in Week 13 of the course. Students will be graded on depth of engagement in the research approach and presentation of qualitative evidence and findings, as well as their presentation skills. The 20 minute presentation will include: framing of research question(s), provide background and context that informs the research setting, explain the rationale and significance of study, theoretical/conceptual framework, research design, findings and implications (next steps in the inquiry). The final 5 minutes of the presentation will include Q&amp;A audience discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Research portfolio (20%)</strong> is the research evidence and supporting information that has informed the presentation of the pilot findings and will include (1) copies of the interview transcripts (formatted and checked; (2) data analysis table (including code definitions and data excerpts) and (3) research memos (a) site and participant selection memo, (b) formative data analysis memo (c) coding memo. The portfolio will be submitted on the day of the presentation. Students are also required to upload a copy of their presentation slides for marking using the assessment Turninin link.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong>:</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Student need select a minimum 10 influential papers from quality journals in their discipline.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the strengths and limitations in following a qualitative inquiry process from their disciplinary perspective.</li>\n<li>Summarise the main challenges/concerns and opportunities in using qualitative methods for data collection and analysis and how this aligns with using data analysis software and AI technologies during the inquiry process. Claims and issues raised should be supported with citations from scholars in your field of research, or social science.</li>\n<li>Explain how ethical practice is (a) formative to qualitative inquiry processes in your field of research, and (b) your own research practice.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the quality criteria for qualitative research and how these criteria influence the qualitative inquiry process adopted in your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students can draw on a range of research evidence to support their research argument.
