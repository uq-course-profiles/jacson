Good source material leads to effective writing! Information will be provided in your tutorial on what each of these elements mean, how you can go about it, as well as how to evaluate AI-generated texts. </p>\n<p>Two AI-generated Annotated Bibliographies have been provided on Blackboard in the Assessment folder. Choose ONE of these to critique for this assessment and download it to your computer to work on. Then complete steps 1-3 below. The word count applies cumulatively to steps 2 &amp; 3 only. <em>Please note that</em> <em>your tutorial in Week 3 will include a walk-through on how to do this assessment.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Reply to the comments in the AI-generated Annotated Bibliography Word document regarding the content provided by ChatGPT. Then, use the matrix provided to evaluate the AI-generated output by <strong>highlighting/bolding</strong> how you think ChatGPT is performing. <strong>See exemplar in the Week 3 for how to do this.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Write a statement that critiques your selected AI-generated Annotated Bibliography and answers the following three questions: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the strengths of the AI-generated annotated bibliography? </li>\n<li>What are the weaknesses of the AI-generated bibliography? </li>\n<li>What is one risk or ethical question raised about using AI-generated articles? </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong>  </p>\n<p>You will need to have selected and watched your movie for your case study essay for Step 3 of this assessment. If you have not done so, go to the Assessment table to check out the approved movie list and how to access those films. Ensure you are clear on what the primary crime/s are in the film. </p>\n<p>Lastly, on your own – without ChatGPT to help you, find a 3rd research article on the same topic that you feel would be useful. Include the following components in the annotation: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Citation in APA 7th </li>\n<li>Summary of the article </li>\n<li>Reflection on how it would be helpful in learning about the crime that is the focus of your movie.</li>\n<li>A statement on research inclusivity to help you prepare for your essay later in the semester. A how-to guide to writing this statement can be found in the course material. </li>\n<li>An exemplar is available on Blackboard for you to view the suggested style and format for your annotation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Your film of choice must come from the list provided in Week 1 of the course. You must consider environmental, legal, and individual factors that might explain the criminal behaviour.

Your essay must focus on arguing why your theory of choice best explains why the criminal in the film has engaged in criminal behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>\n<p>1.    Provide a profile of the individual who has engaged in crime.</p>\n<p>·        Discuss their demographics (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic status, location, education, family background), the characteristics of their offending behaviour and the history of their offending behaviour.</p>\n<p>2.    Outline your chosen theory.</p>\n<p>·        You must choose a theory from the list provided. These are the theories we cover in readings and lectures.</p>\n<p>·        Explain the central principles of the theory (what does it try to explain about crime?) and briefly examine the literature of the theory that exists in scholarly work.</p>\n<p>·        Outline critiques of the theory.</p>\n<p>3.    Apply your theory to the individual in the film.</p>\n<p>·        Examine and discuss how your selected theory explains the behaviour of the character.</p>\n<p>·        Provide examples (observations) from the movie to support your argument.</p>\n<p>·        Highlight any deficiencies of the theory – what can it not explain?</p>\n<p>Your case study should have an introduction and a conclusion and follow one cohesive argument about how your theory explains the character's behaviour.</p>\n<p>You can use the following headings to organise your case study:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>Character Profile</li>\n<li>Theoretical Framework</li>\n<li>Theoretical Argument</li>\n<li>Conclusion</li>\n<li>References (You must use APA 7th referencing style)</li>\n<li>AI Usage Statement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technical Requirements:</p>\n<p>Your essay should include at least 7 scholarly, peer-reviewed references.

The aim is to find explanations that can be applied to different kinds of situations, people, and crimes. This task asked you to take a look at a depiction of crime/criminals and think about how our criminological explanations shed light on understanding their behaviour. This is a critical skill for anyone moving forward to advanced criminology courses.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
