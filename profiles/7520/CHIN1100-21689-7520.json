The interview is also used to assess the ability to comprehend other speakers and to respond appropriately as a listener. <strong>Palm cards are not allowed in oral interviews</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Role-play</strong>: you are expected to perform with your partner one of three role-plays based on the units covered this semester.

Feel free to express your creativity and depart from the details if you so desire. Either way, you will need to extend a bit on the basic framework provided. Ten minutes before your scheduled time slot you will be randomly allotted one of the three role-plays. Your role-play should last 2 to 2.5 minutes (approximately 12-14 lines for each speaker, or 20-25 lines altogether).</p>\n<p><strong>Question-and-answer:</strong> Your assessor(s) will ask you approximately 8 questions.
