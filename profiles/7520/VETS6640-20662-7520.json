It should be on a topic that is relevant to the honours research question being asked in VETS6616, VETS6617, VETS6628 or VETS6629 but should not be the same as the actual literature review of the honours thesis. For example - the topic could be related to a particular set of methodologies that are required to conduct the research project such as hormone assays or nutritional analyses. The review should summarize salient findings, arguments, theories and other developments.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is linked with the Honours Assessment Authenticity Report (Assessment Task 2 below).</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
