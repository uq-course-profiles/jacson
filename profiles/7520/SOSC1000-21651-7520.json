But it is also true that news headlines deeply affect our interpretations and understandings of social issues and are, therefore, active in <em>creating </em>social meaning. Australian journalist, Jane Gilmore, began a ‘<a href=\"https://janegilmore.com/category/fixedit/\">Fixed It’ campaign</a> to rewrite what she saw as unfair and partial news headlines about violence against women. For this assignment, students are asked to take a similar approach to Gilmore, using Carol Bacchi's 'What's the Problem Represented to Be' ('WPR') framework to guide their analysis. They will be provided with a series of newspaper headlines concerning a variety of social issues. They must choose one headline to focus on for their assignment and draw upon their sociological imaginations to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how the headline frames the social issue(s) at hand (what is the 'problem' represented to be)?</li>\n<li>who is portrayed as good/bad in the framing (what assumptions underlie this framing)?</li>\n<li>what is missing from this framing (what are the 'silences'; what is left 'unproblematic')?</li>\n<li>what effects are produced by this representation of the 'problem'?</li>\n<li>what might an alternative framing look like (can the 'problem' be thought about differently)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students are asked to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rewrite the headline to reflect a ‘fairer’ and ‘fuller’ framing of the social issue at hand, and</li>\n<li>write a 1,500-word short essay to accompany their rewritten headline; the short essay must present their analysis of the previous headline, as well as explain and justify their revised headline (with support of at least 10 x scholarly research references).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of generative artificial intelligence (AI): </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are encouraged to use generative AI to assist in redrafting their newspaper headlines.

Particular thanks go to Lillian Dullat, whose idea and provocation for students to ‘know where they’re standing’ provided the catalyst for this assignment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>This assignment will be undertaken in groups, and consists of two components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Part A – Oral presentation component, and </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Part B – Written essay component. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each student group will deliver <em>one</em> oral presentation and<em> one</em> essay (collaboratively drafted).</p>\n<p><strong>Due day/time: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Part A - Oral presentation component:</strong> Student groups will deliver their presentations in the module 3 lectures (which run during the final seminars in semester weeks 10-13).
