Students will receive a mark of zero for any quizzes that are missed. The final grade for the quiz component will be based on the best eight quiz marks (out of a possible maximum of ten). The quiz is 'open book' format, and students may confer within their groups to discuss responses to the quiz questions.</p>\n<p>The weekly quiz will include multiple choice, true/false and short answer questions. The quiz will assess content from the mixed methods, quantitative, and qualitative research streams taught throughout the semester. The quiz will assess both your synthesised knowledge of the course and attendance and engagement with the practical's. You may be expected to answer quiz questions based on activities completed during the practical's, including reading and interpreting computer output from quantitative statistical analysis.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
