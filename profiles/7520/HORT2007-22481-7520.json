The topics may include challenges faced in horticulture today, with solutions that promote the sustainable production of fresh produce for the domestic or export market. After deciding on a topic (please consult Course Coordinator for suitability), use a UQ Library database, such as Web of Science or Science Direct to search for relevant scientific literature. Select a minimum of 5 related, peer reviewed, journal papers and synthesise the information (put the information together) to form an argument.</p>\n<p>Your argument will be delivered as a Poster that will be presented to the audience. This will be 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) style. Make it punchy and impactful. Your job is to drive change.</p>\n<p>You will be marked on the quality of your poster as well as the quality of your presentation. </p>\n<p>Further details for this assessment including the marking criteria will be available in the course blackboard site.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
