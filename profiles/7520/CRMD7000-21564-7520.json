The diary should not be just a set of “lecture notes” and does not have to be written in chronological order. It should provide 4-6 examples of experiences during the workshop that you found enlightening, interesting, challenging, difficult or puzzling. Reflective writing involves a brief description of the experience, including what you did/said or thought and how others reacted to it. You then reflect on how you felt during the experience and discuss why you think the experience occurred or why you felt a certain way. If appropriate, give examples of how your experience relates to other experiences outside the workshop context from your professional or personal life. You are also required to relate your experiences to the course readings and other academic and practitioner literature on mediation and conflict resolution to further investigate what happened and to draw lessons for similar events in the future. It is essential that you undertake further readings after the workshop and that you reference scholarly literature in your learning journal. The final part of reflective writing is to develop learning or changes in practice and to set up potential experiments for when you encounter a similar situation in the future. This process will be discussed further during class and will be used to debrief role play simulations in the course.</p>\n<p>The journal must also contain at least one reflection on one of the role play exercises in which you were the mediator. Point out what you did well and what you want to improve on and compare your role play experience to the practitioner literature on mediation.</p>\n<p>The word limit for the reflective learning journal is <strong>2500 words</strong>. You are required to use the standard referencing procedures described in the POLSIS Essay Guide . You can write the journal in the first person and you can structure it either chronologically or by topic. Please refer to the assessment criteria sheet for the learning journal before you start writing. You must also copy and paste the assessment criteria sheet at the end of your assignment (last page). This sheet is available on Learn.UQ Blackboard under Assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflective writing summary:</strong></p>\n<p>Reflective writing always includes a short and concrete description of a situation, learning activity, behaviour or example (it is helpful if you reflect on a particular intervention that you engaged in as a mediator to actually write down what you said). Then you describe how the situation/activity/discussion impacted on you emotionally and how your behaviour impacted on others involved (in the way that you perceived their reactions or according to their reflections during the debriefing of the experience). You then compare your experience to relevant scholarly literature on the topic (and include references) and critically examine the situation. You may agree or disagree with the literature, you can raise further questions or pose concerns. Finally, you should formulate take home messages and areas for self-improvement and learning. </p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.
