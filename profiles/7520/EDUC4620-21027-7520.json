Prior to your professional experience placement you should consult closely with your tutor to design an appropriate project to ensure that it addresses an issue of current relevance within schools. This project will be implemented during your professional experience placement. It should be closely linked to your everyday work as a teacher and focused on improving students’ educational outcomes.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>To choose a topic, you should draw on the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers and identify a particular professional learning need to improve your practice. You might relate this professional learning need to a teaching area you enjoy, or a topic that you are really interested in. As you may not know your professional experience placement until just prior to commencement, remember to ensure that your research based project, as one source of professional learning, could be conducted in any school.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your proposal should include:</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction. </strong>Outline the background to your problem. Include a clear statement of the issue to be investigated, and let the reader know why this issue is important and how it connects with a particular professional learning need you have identified from the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers to improve your practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review of relevant literature </strong>on research findings in the area of your proposed project. Demonstrate your analysis of the research others have done: who has conducted the research, when and where was the research conducted, how was the research conducted, what were their findings? Analyse and synthesise the articles in a way that provides an integrated argument in relation to the topic. Conclude by establishing the need for the research you plan to conduct by explaining how your project extends from or fills small gaps in the current literature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>research question</strong>/s to be addressed. State them clearly as questions. You will have a main research question and possibly some sub-questions (no more than two) that will help you answer your main research question.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>research design/method</strong>. Describe your proposed research design. What will be the context of your study? Who/what do you propose will be the object(s) of or the participants in your study? How will you select your research participants, if applicable? What instruments will you use to collect your data? <strong>You must include your data collection tool/s in an appendix</strong>. What steps will you take to collect and record your data? How will you analyse your data? That is, how will you collate your data and make sense of your findings? <strong>Justify your research design choices with academic references and demonstrate understanding of principles of ethical conduct of research as well as relevant legislative policies and processes throughout</strong>. Ask yourself: With the information provided, could your study be replicated?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conclude </strong>by articulating how you believe the knowledge generated by the research based project will assist you to improve your practice as a beginning teacher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>References</strong>. Use <strong>APA style </strong>referencing both within the proposal and the reference list. The reference list should contain only references directly mentioned in the proposal rather than a bibliography of other relevant but non-cited references. It is expected that <strong>at least 15 </strong>relevant, recent academic references (from 2005 onwards) are included.

While it would normally be the case that your research reflects your proposal, changed circumstances may necessitate an alteration to the proposed project. Remember that your project should be closely linked to your everyday work as a teacher and focused on improving students' educational outcomes.
