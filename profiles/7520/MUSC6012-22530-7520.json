Please consult with your supervisor about the appropriate format for your thesis.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that the following elements are usually deemed essential to the production of an academic thesis:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Stating rationale and/or purpose of study, as well as outlining and elaborating the research topic/question.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Body</strong></p>\n<p>Usually a number of chapters, comprising, among various possible elements: an examination of current research and related literature to the central purpose of the study leading to relevant research questions and hypotheses (effectively, a literature review); application of a valid research method and approach to address the principal questions or hypotheses, statement of results and discussion of the findings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Synthesising the main aspects of the study. The discussion and anticipation of further study demonstrate an awareness of the implications and further application of the findings in a broader context.</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Students should download the MS Word file Honours thesis format from the Learning Resources section of Blackboard and use this to prepare the final draft for submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong></p>\n<p>You are required to use 12pt font size, Times New Roman and 1.5 spacing.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
