The writing task must be submitted during class via the weekly link in the Learning Resources folder. These are marked on a pass/fail basis. In <strong>week 13</strong> you have the opportunity to earn <strong>up to 6 marks</strong> towards your final grade by bringing to your scheduled tutorial a prepared research essay plan and participating in a peer review workshop. Three printed copies of a typed research essay plan as described in the criteria sheet must be brought to your scheduled tutorial. If you do not attend your tutorial that week, you may submit your Essay Plan by email to your tutor for minor feedback but no marks will be awarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Consistent preparation and participation lead to better learning outcomes and more productive and enjoyable learning experiences. Through participation, humanities students gain a highly valued and distinctive skill set in critical thinking, discipline mastery, evidence-based learning, and collaboration. These skills are required by many workplaces. The ability to write on a set topic and within a short time frame is a valuable academic and vocational skill, and it helps you to track your learning and prepare for written assessment tasks. Finally, this assessment item builds students' confidence and experience in writing at advanced levels and provides general, targeted and solicited feedback.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
