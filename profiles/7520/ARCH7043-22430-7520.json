Students will work in groups to prepare detailed measured drawing records of existing structures, access archival material and prepare a project dossier containing relevant planning codes, key building legislation, and a summary of the social-cultural context of the site and its locale. An individual project task will accompany this site research. Students will be asked to undertake a reflective exercise, recounting a memorable room and analysing spatial characteristics and atmospheric qualities. Both tasks will be presented to the collective to assist in knowledge sharing.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively please contact your Course Coordinator for support. </p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task addresses the National Standard of Competency for Architects (NSCA) (2021) Performance Criteria (PCs) [26, 29, 30, 32, 40, 45B].</strong> These will be outlined in more detail in your assessment task instructions and on the associated marking rubric.
