The number of questions sequentially increases with each CAT (see table below), reflecting your expanding knowledge base. This approach helps you retain, build and apply the knowledge acquired across the two years of the program. The cumulative approach reinforces long-term learning by regularly reviewing past material while integrating new concepts. Your scores will accumulate across the four (4) CATs. The percentage contribution of each CAT to the sequence cumulative total score is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CAT 5 (week 8) contributes 15% of the total CAT score,</li>\n<li>CAT 6 (week 17) contributes 25% of the total CAT score,</li>\n<li>CAT 7 (mid-year exam week) contributes 25% of the total CAT score,</li>\n<li>CAT 8 (end of year examination period) contributes 35% of the total CAT score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions in each CAT will cover course material up to and including the week before the CAT, including content you have covered previously in this course and in the preceding years of the program.</p>\n<p>Each CAT exam varies in duration and will be a maximum of 120 minutes.
