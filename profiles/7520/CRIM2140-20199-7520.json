In Week 6 students will produce a (maximum 2 page) policy brief, with little time or notice, on a subject of the instructor’s choosing. This exercise is intended to simulate a frequent real world policy scenario where senior decision makers, often reacting to emerging events and needing to act quickly, seek guidance at the last minute. The policy brief will be structured as a response to an email requesting advice on a course of action related to a triggering event. After receiving the assigned topic, students will have approximately 48 hours to complete the brief.</p>\n<p>The topic will be uploaded to blackboard and emailed to the students' University of Queensland email account on 31st of March 8am</p>\n<p>The brief is due on 2nd April 12 noon. Students will need to submit their brief electronically through turn-it-in on blackboard. There will be no class scheduled for the 31st of March.</p>\n<p>The brief will account for 40% of a student’s final grade.</p>\n<p>What to include in your brief:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide an overview of the problem:</li>\n<li>What is the problem?</li>\n<li>For whom, how and why?</li>\n<li>What is the extent of the problem?</li>\n<li>What makes this a public policy issue?</li>\n<li>Why has this come to the government’s attention?</li>\n<li>Provide a brief paragraph critiquing on current policy/approach to the problem. Make sure this is based on 'evidence'.</li>\n<li>What approach is currently being implemented and what evidence exists for this approach?</li>\n<li>What are some alternative options (perhaps being used in other jurisdictions) that are supported by evidence (have been evaluated)?</li>\n<li>Based on evidence, propose a course of action related to the problem and justify your recommendations refering to theory and evidence.</li>\n<li>What was the theoretical basis for the approach? (e.g. According to Routine Activity Theory opportunities for crime occur when offender and target come together in time and space in the absence of a guardian so an intervention may have focused on target hardening to make the target more difficult to reach. Another example, an intervention based on deterrence/ rational choice theories that purport the rational nature of criminal decision making may increase patrols and penalties to heighten the certainty of detection and consequences of offending).</li>\n<li>What is required to implement the policy (resources, training, legislation) and who are the key stakeholders (police, courts, corrections, health providers)?</li>\n<li>How can the policy be evaluated?</li>\n<li>Potential limitations and/or unintended consequences?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

You decide to use an AI system (such as ChatGPT) to provide an outline of potential policy and program interventions. You will use this as a foundation for your own assessment of previous empirical scholarly studies before selecting a particular program to trial and evaluate.</p>\n<p><strong>For this assessment you are required to complete 3 tasks:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(1)   Generate a policy that aims to address juvenile crime</strong> by focusing on both prevention and effective responses to offenses committed by minors using an AI system, such as ChatGPT. You will attach your AI system output as an appendix.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Critically assess the policy/programs provided by the AI system based on scholarly literature: </strong>Think about the following aspects of the policy components/programs:</p>\n<p><strong>- </strong><em>Effectiveness</em><strong>: </strong>How likely is the policy to reduce juvenile crime rates? Use evidence, theories, or studies on juvenile delinquency and effective interventions to support your response.</p>\n<p><strong>- </strong><em>Feasibility:</em> Consider the practicalities of implementation. Are there financial, social or logistical barriers to the policy’s success?</p>\n<p><strong>- </strong><em>Equity:</em><strong> </strong>Does the policy adequately address the needs of individuals in marginalized groups? Will the policy have unintended consequences for some groups?</p>\n<p><strong>- </strong><em>Ethical considerations:</em> Is the policy fair and just in its consideration and treatment of juvenile offenders? Consider, right to respect, safety and</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Based on your assessment of the literature</strong>, <strong>select one component of the AI generated policy</strong> that you are going to trial. <strong>Generate a detailed project logic model</strong> outlining the inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes involved in the implementation and evaluation of the component of the juvenile crime prevention and response policy that you are going to trial. For example, based on your review of the literature you might decide to trial <strong>diversion programs for low-level or first time juvenile offenders committing non-violent offenses. </strong>The programs might include: restorative justice circles; community service; life skills workshops; and educational support such as tutoring and mentoring to improve academic engagement. You need to develop a <strong>logic model </strong>outlining what this trial and evaluation would look like.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE: It is essential that your selection of the program you use in your logic model is based on your assessment of the literature (task 2). </em></p>\n<p>When evaluating a <strong>juvenile justice policy or program component</strong>, a logic model can help outline how the policy aims to prevent and respond to juvenile crime, as well as identify expected outcomes and how to measure them. </p>\n<p>Your report should include (1) an introduction, (2) a summary of the policy you generated using chat GPT (3) a review of the literature that shows support for elements of the generated policy AND/OR critiques elements of the generated policy, (4) a paragraph stating which element of the generated policy you would most recommend based on the literature review (approximately 1500-1800 words). You should then provide a logic model as Figure 1 including inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes specific to the implementation of your recommended policy. We will practice the development of logic models in class.</p>\n<p>In total your assessment piece should be between <strong>1500-1800 words - not including your logic model. </strong>You can use sub-headings to organise your work. You should reference academic journal articles and policy reports. A full reference list is required. You must attach you Chat GPT generated policy as Appendix 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
