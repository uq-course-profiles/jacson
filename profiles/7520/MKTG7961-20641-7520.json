You will submit the first draft of your marketing plan design.</li>\n<li>First, you must identify an agribusiness product or program that will be the focus of your assessment for the semester. You can select a product/program of interest, but it should be related to the food and agriculture sector. The product/program can be an existing product/program of an existing agribusiness company or public institution or a new product/program that you think an existing agribusiness company/public institution should develop. The product/program can be from any country. You should select a product/program for which there is likely to be a reasonable amount of secondary data. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your selected product/program with the teaching staff before the end of the third week of the semester.</li>\n<li>Secondly, you can either develop your marketing plan design (within the word limit) or use a template accessible from the course Blackboard site. The suggested word limit is 1,500 for the completed marketing plan design. This will not be strictly imposed, but you should aim to be between 10% below and above this word limit. The word limit excludes the references list, figures and tables. The completed marketing plan design must include the following sections:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>An overview of the company profile and the product(s)</li>\n<li>The market environment</li>\n<li>Identification of problems</li>\n<li>The proposed objectives</li>\n<li>A proposed table of contents (TOC) for the marketing plan and a brief description of what each section of the TOC will contain</li>\n<li>Sources of data and information that you will access to support the development of your marketing plan and your plan to analyse them</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The first draft</strong> - It should at least have the following parts: the company profile, the product(s) and the market environment. There is no world limit imposed on this draft submission. You will receive feedback on your first draft. You can, therefore, submit more sections to get more feedback.</li>\n<li>You should <strong>not</strong> contact any agribusiness to complete your marketing plan. You should base your work on secondary data and your critical thinking/observations.</li>\n<li>Throughout this semester, you will only prepare a single marketing plan. You can change the content submitted in this assessment when you submit your next assessment. </li>\n<li><strong>Tutorial participation</strong> - Internal students are expected to attend all scheduled learning hours in person and communicate their work progress with the teaching staff when asked to do so. You are expected to prepare for the class and tutorial activity before coming to class. Your participation will be recorded and considered for this assessment's marking. If you cannot attend the tutorial activities, please get in touch with your tutor. Alternative evidence of participation (e.g. submission of tutorial notes) might be required. </li>\n<li>You can consult with the teaching staff at all stages of the marketing plan development by email/in-person consultation.</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) </strong>- This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</li>\n<li>A useful link: https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/ai-tools-assignments</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
