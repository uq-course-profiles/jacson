Computer and information technology has enabled the use of websites and other online materials for language learning in the virtual space. Like printed reading textbooks, language learning websites often act as a central agent for disseminating knowledge from a particular perspective. Critical Discourse Analysis suggests that all texts and materials carry particular messages about how society as well as people is perceived and constructed, and when they are developed by governments or other agencies, these messages may be quite purposefully and carefully selected. Through the ideologies embedded in the discourse, texts often tell us something about the attitudes, values, power relationships and orientations of both the target (English language) and home society or the online community in the case of</p>\n<p>virtual space. </p>\n<p>In this assessment item, you will examine text materials related to textbooks, websites or media including social media to uncover some of these issues. Written as well as spoken texts can be selected for this analysis. Your selected text(s) for analysis does not have to be about language teaching and learning. However, for practical reasons, the text(s) has to be in English. The work by Norman Fairclough is a starting point for CDA. The course will provide many examples of CDA work selected from various contexts.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
