Choosing one approach and one main material, develop a conceptual idea that clearly articulates your understandings of ‘HOME AS COUNTRY and the MATERIAL APPRECIATIONS’ present in that sphere. Consider how your initial conceptual expression celebrates materiality and its relationships to Country that resonates for you. Consider how your audience will experience the work and if the introduction of a secondary material provides a meaningful contribution to your project alongside your main material. The work should be of professional presentation standard and indicate that consideration has been given to the way it is to be presented and approached by the viewer.</p>\n<p>Remember - ‘SCULPTURAL FORM’ CAN BE INTERPRETED BROADLY AND CAN BE EPHEMERAL AND PROCESS BASED. YOU MAY WANT TO PROPOSE A VIDEO, PERFORMANCE OR SOMETHING OTHER – this will be discussed in the lecture series.</p>\n<p>This assignment focuses on material-based investigations as a method of research relationally with Country to generate new ideas. This is a quick exercise that places emphasis on process - participation, background research and engagement. Above all, it is an expression of who you are as a person in the world and the relationships that are important to you as part of a broader network of living beings that belong to cultures, communities, places and knowledge systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI or MT to support learning:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Through making ‘as expression’ students will explore Country as Home to enrich Materiality + Practice. Your expression of HOME offers a clear conceptual basis for how your interact with Country through belonging. Your belonging will be critical to the creation of your own Living Belonging to reinforce the importance of Country and place-shaping through conceptualised making practices. The stories behind your Living Belonging will allow guests of the Australian Pavilion to connect with Country in different ways, disrupting or questioning normative perceptions through your experiences to enable new understandings. </p>\n<p>Your Living Belonging is a material expression that will live in an online sphere for a global audience to experience, learn and listen to how your ways of being, knowing and doing through an architectural lens. You will be part of a national collaborative sphere of a future generation practitioners and academics that will present new appreciations of Country as HOME.</p>\n<p>Your Living Belonging may be part of a final selection of 150 chosen Living Belonging that will be physically exhibited in the Australian Pavilion. Therefore, your created expression must be robust to ensure guests of the HOME exhibition can touch and handle your Living Belonging over a six-month period. It should be resolved, well-articulated and share your ideas and critical thinking through thorough, rigorous and creative processes. It is critical that your processes communicate to a global audience as part of the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale Australian Pavilion. The work should be of exceptional standard and indicate deep consideration in the way your expressions are presented and understood by the viewer.</p>\n<p>This assessment celebrates your Living Belonging as a fine detail sculpture and its presence within a context of other belongings.
