During the semester there will be ten readings provided to students (worth one point each for a total possible of ten points) and each will require a written response to be uploaded. Students must submit their response by Friday, 4pm of each required week. The list of stories and submission times will be listed in BlackBoard.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Consistent preparation for tutorials and engagement with the readings leads to better learning and writing outcomes, and more productive and enjoyable learning experiences. Through responding to set questions, writing students are challenged to consider writerly techniques in an academic and personal way, and gain highly valued and distinctive skills in critical thinking, evidence-based learning, and creative and professional writing - crucial skills required and highly valued by many workplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation: </strong>Because of our focus on reading, analysis and creative writing, we expect students will come to tutorials well-prepared i.e. having read the set stories and developed some ideas and questions. This will ensure students are individually prepared and ready to respond to a set question or series of set questions provided in class, therefore contributing to class discussions and ensuring each tutorial will be a valuable learning experience. Students will receive the weekly story (or stories) to be read via each teaching week’s Learning Resources folder within BlackBoard, then will complete a Reading Response in class which will then be uploaded for assessment.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
