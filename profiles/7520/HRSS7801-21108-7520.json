To decide who gets the funding, a pitching session has been arranged for staff to ‘pitch’ their idea for a systematic review to the physiotherapy leadership team.</p>\n<p>Your task, in your teams of 4 students, is to deliver a presentation that aims to convince these senior physiotherapists that your systematic review idea should be the project that gets funded. Your presentation should also be educational, as your physiotherapy colleagues will also be in the audience for the pitching session.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Microsoft Powerpoint presentation of <strong>7 slides</strong>. <strong>Maximum 5 minutes 30 seconds</strong> for delivery. All students should present a component of the presentation. </p>\n<p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> Four questions will be given to students in week 1. Students will prepare answers to these questions. Two questions will be chosen at random on the day of presentation to be answered in front of the class. </p>\n<p><strong>Submission of presentation file: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teams will be required to submit a copy of their Powerpoint presentation via Blackboard no later than <strong>9am on Thursday 20 March</strong>. One student from each team needs to submit the presentation on behalf of all team members.</li>\n<li>The Powerpoint file (.pptx) (or PDF file of the slides (.pdf) if the .pptx file is too big) should be submitted via the link in the Blackboard folder for the Oral Presentation assessment item.</li>\n<li>Students must not change the Powerpoint file in between submission to Blackboard and delivery in the classroom. The tutorial will be recorded for cross-checking of presentation files after the end of the session. There is an element in the rubric for reducing marks if changes to presentations are identified.</li>\n<li>At the start of class, all teams will be asked to upload a copy of their presentation to the computer in the tutorial room. This will allow for a smooth transition between teams during the tutorial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The journal is to be agreed upon by the group and the expert advisor. Guidelines for authors must be followed for the journal and the guidelines should be included with the submission. An electronic copy of the report is to be submitted using the Turnitin link in the Assessment tab on the Blackboard site. Copies of all data must be handed to the expert advisor at the end of the course.</p>\n<p>When submitting the written report, students will submit both the UQ SHRS assignment coversheet to acknowledge the originality of their work, as well as an authorship acknowledgement form based on ICMJE recommendations to confirm all students meet the definition of an author.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The preparation of the written report requires students to work in groups of <strong>3 - 4 students</strong>. The way in which students work constructively together in these groups is considered essential to a successful research project outcome in the form of the submitted written report. Students will be provided with access to resources throughout the semester to promote effective teamwork.</p>\n<p>As part of the assessment of the written report, each student will submit a Peer Assessment Factor (PAF) form via Blackboard which asks each student to rate the performance and contribution of themselves and the other members of their team to the project. Each student completes the PAF form and shares their form only with the Course Coordinator via Blackboard. Students will be asked to complete a formative PAF form at mid-semester, and a summative PAF form at the end of semester. The end of semester PAF form will be used in the assessment of the written report. Grades for students won't be processed until all students within a team submit the end of semester PAF form.</p>\n<p>Using the PAF form, each student will evaluate the members of their team and themselves for each of the following four criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication &amp; Collaboration</li>\n<li>Contribution to Overall Project</li>\n<li>Timeliness</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PAF for an individual student is calculated by the sum of all scores attributed to the student divided by 4 (the number of criteria) multiplied by 100.</p>\n<p>The average PAF score is 1.00, reflecting that a student has undertaking a similar amount of work to the other members of their team. The Course Coordinator will moderate all peer assessment, so that the PAF system cannot be used to skew the results either in favour of oneself or to disadvantage someone else.  In addition to the PAF, a Self-Assessment over Peer Assessment (SAPA) factor and a Ratio will also be calculated to identify if a student is over-estimated or under-valuing their own contribution (SAPA) or over-estimating or under-valuing the contribution of another student (Ratio). The Course Coordinator will take into consideration the comments made by students on the PAF form and the observations of the Expert Advisor/s and Tutor before PAF moderation occurs.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
