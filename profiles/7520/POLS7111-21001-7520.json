This discussion must cover the scope/wording of the topic, the relevant policy theories, the relevant empirical sources for the research, and the student's research approach. This discussion and approval should happen at least 3-4 weeks before the due date for submission.</p>\n<p>Your essay will analyse a selected policy problem, decision or trend, by relating it to wider theories and issues about the policy-making process as discussed extensively in the course.</p>\n<p>Your essay will NOT be based on personal opinion or on internet summaries.</p>\n<p>The Essay should aim to connect policy theory to your chosen actual policy example. To ensure this connection is clear, you MUST clear your proposed topic with the course convenor at least one month before completing the Essay. Please begin to think about how to select a policy issue or policy problem or policy process, which is of interest to you, and which is likely to have a sufficient range of material available to provide an in-depth analysis of the actors, processes and context in which the policy decision or policy outcome was produced.</p>\n<p>The analytical task is to explain what happened and why in relation to your policy example. Where practicable, you might consider using both primary sources (e.g. government documents) and secondary sources (e.g. commentaries by scholars, stakeholders and media analysts). The conceptual task is to connect your analysis of this problem or policy case to the broader themes and theories discussed in the course. Simply describing what happened is NOT enough.</p>\n<p>The Essay is required by 5pm on the last day of the teaching semester, namely: Friday 30th May 2025.<strong> </strong>Information about valid grounds for extensions can be found at <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/node/218/2#2\">https://my.uq.edu.au/node/218/2#2</a></p>\n<p>The Essay should be clearly structured and properly referenced, using the POLSIS Essay Guide. The maximum word limit of 4000 words (excluding references and attachments) with a 10% tolerance. Writing to a set limit is a valuable skill in professional analysis, so take this limit seriously.</p>\n<p>It is acceptable to attach a short documentary or statistical appendix to back up your argument, but this will not itself be the subject of assessment.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment instructions, assessments are to be completed without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT).
