Give consideration to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The adverse impacts of agricultural production on soil N concentrations? AND</li>\n<li>The benefits of N fertilisation (consider not only the direct benefits in terms of increased agricultural production, but more broadly, consider the importance of N fertilisers in feeding the global human population). AND</li>\n<li>The adverse outcomes of N fertilisation on the environment, and how these adverse impacts could be minimised.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>OR</strong></p>\n<p>Biofuel production from soil. There is increasing pressure on soils, not only because we need to produce more food for a growing human population, but also because of competing uses of soils, such as for the production of biofuels.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How the magnitude (volume) of biofuel production has changed over time and how this has provided competition with the use ofsoils to produce food, AND</li>\n<li>How ‘environmentally friendly’ biofuels are (i.e. their relative climate warming) when taking into account a full ‘lifecycle analysis’ of biofuel production. Give a special focus to soil-related factors, such as production and use of N fertilisers and subsequent emissions of greenhouse gases from soils. Discuss how these factors offset the desired ‘cooling’ by saving fossil fuel usage.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Begin by reading all relevant material thoroughly. As you read, make notes of the important ideas and concepts. When writing the analysis, consider the following suggested structure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction. Describe the overall topic, and summarise your main points that you will then expand in later sections.</li>\n<li>Main text (this could be split into different sections). Describe in detail your main information by assessing, reviewing, and summarising the relevant information. Support your evaluation with detailed evidence from the literature. Do not forget to include appropriate references.</li>\n<li>Summary. Finish with a summary and an evaluation of your main conclusions.</li>\n<li>References. Do not cite your Course notes (for example, LAND2003 or LAND3005). Rather, you must only cite articles and books from the scientific literature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Length: 2000 words +/- 10% (excluding references and any appendices)</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
