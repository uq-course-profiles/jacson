For the purposes of assessment, the three components of meaningful participation are: preparation for class; engagement with the learning activities in class; and respectful peer collaboration. You are assessed on how you demonstrate absorption of the lecture content which means that to prepare you must attend the lecture and complete the preparatory readings. You should bring a copy of the relevant text and any additional material, such as handouts, to every tutorial and you must have read them at least once. You are graded on participation in tutorials; attendance itself isn't enough because it is assumed that you will be present. Participation means willing involvement, active engagement with the text and the tasks at hand, asking questions, working well in groups, etc. Acting ability is not assessed. Central to group work is accountability, and the relationships that you develop with your peers. Peer accountability will be considered when determining the group work aspect of your participation grade. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>If you are absent from your tutorial through documented illness or other documented circumstances beyond your control, and supply this documentation to your tutor, you will receive a pass mark (in the range of a four) for that week. Students will be given feedback on their participation in <strong>Week 6</strong>, after three tutorials have been conducted, and again in <strong>Week 9</strong>, after six tutorials have been conducted. It is a requirement that students read the set text before they attend tutorials.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.

Your performances will be graded on, amongst other things, your engagement with technology and performance techniques as introduced in the tutorials. Your acting skill will not be directly assessed. </p>\n<p>Group members will each receive the same grade out of 20 for the performance, although you will be invited to give peer feedback which will be taken into account and used if necessary to augment individual marks.</p>\n<p>There is a 10-minute maximum performance time for this assignment. This short piece will be performed for other DRAM1100 students in Week 12 during normal tutorial times. </p>\n<p>A full assignment brief will be made available on Blackboard during the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note: </strong>An alternative assessment piece will be available for a small number of students undertaking secondments to the DRAM2200 production being performed by advanced Drama students at UQ this semester. As only a handful of secondments are available, applications will be competitive for these placements. Further details on how to apply will be forthcoming via Blackboard. </p>\n<p>In line with UQ assessment procedures, all aural and practical assessments worth more than 20% are to be recorded. Group Performances and individual presentations will be video recorded by your class tutor and retained for moderation and/or re-marking purposes. These recordings will be stored by the school for one year following the release of final course grades, after which time they will be deleted. Written or email permission will be sought should a recording be sought to be used as an exemplar for future years</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
