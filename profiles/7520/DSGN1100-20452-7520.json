A course portfolio is a series of weekly activities related to the design project that you will be asked to complete in the studio from weeks 6 to 12. The portfolio should encompass all materials in detail. You explore different ideas and try different techniques to communicate your design concepts. You will finally present your final design portfolio to your tutors and peers on (Week 13).</p>\n<p>There are three components for Assessment 2:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The Course Work Portfolio: Digital (PDF) submission-Individual (40%)</strong></p>\n<p>The Course Work portfolio should be A3 size and oriented in landscape format, with your name and ID included. It must be compiled digitally in PDF format. Each page of the portfolio should clearly state the name of the section. All drawings, text, and sketches must be legible and effectively convey the key works and drawings. The portfolio should be compiled digitally into a single PDF for final submission in Week 13.</p>\n<p>Note for the portfolio: In Week 12, students will collaboratively assess their peer's concept and provide feedback using the Feedback Form. The completed Feedback Form should be included in the portfolio submission. Please refer to the Blackboard for the portfolio requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>2)     Portfolio Presentation: Presentation-Individual (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>Students will deliver an oral summary of your project to your tutor and peers during the studio in Week 13, Thursday, 29/05/2025. Maximum of 5 minutes for presentation, plus 5 minutes for questions/discussion. You will present your portfolio and your final concept and highlight the design values  to your peers and tutor. </p>\n<p><strong>3)     A3 Sketchbook-Individual (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>You should hand in your A3 sketchbook to your tutor on the presentation day of Week 13.</p>\n<p>For more information, check the Assessment 2 Rubric on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment tasks prohibiting use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
