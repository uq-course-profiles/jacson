Timetables for the allocated laboratory classes will be posted in the laboratory and on Blackboard. Please note the dates and times of your allocated laboratory sessions. There is a compulsory laboratory induction in Week 2 before the first experiment. You must complete this induction before being allowed to start the practicals. The Laboratory Manual will be made available during the safety induction. </p>\n<p>Note that protective glasses, appropriate footwear and a laboratory coat are required when in the laboratory.</p>\n<p>Typically an experiment will require two 3-hour sessions, one for the synthesis and one for instrumentation / measurements / analysis. You may find that you require an extra session to fully complete the experiment. Each of the three experiments is carried out in blocks so they are aligned to the lecture content at that time. You are not required to attend a lab session every week. If you miss your scheduled session and have to reschedule outside your allotted time, you should email the Course Coordinator so a suitable time can be arranged. You may be required to provide appropriate documentary evidence (e.g. a medical certificate) as you can only reschedule outside your allotted time once without penalty (see Additional Information).</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
