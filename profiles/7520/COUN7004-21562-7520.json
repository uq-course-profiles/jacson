In the last year, the agency has noticed a trend of couples presenting with a particular issue (of your choosing). You have been assigned to research and develop a treatment manual that gives other clinicians a guide to this presenting issue and a particular treatment for it. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Therefore the treatment manual is designed to be used by other professionals for the assessment and treatment of a specific population of couples presenting for relationship counselling. Examples of topics could include domestic violence; substance abuse; mental health problems; infidelity; multicultural relationships; sexual functioning; sexual orientation; gender issues; older clients; physical injury; parenting; step-parenting; or other topics as negotiated with the course coordinator. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your manual should include the following:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>• A clear outline of the topic, issue, or problem.</p>\n<p>• A brief outline of the assessment methods that would be used or a description of changes to existing methods or measures that may need to be made to accommodate a particular population.</p>\n<p>• A comprehensive outline of treatment containing enough detail for another counsellor to use it as a guide.</p>\n<p>• Inclusion of empirically-based, up-to-date literature to support the efficacy of the approach suggested. If no empirical evidence is available, an extrapolation from basic principles and reference to treatment in other domains should be made.</p>\n<p>• At least two examples of different resources that would aid a practitioner in any stage of the treatment (e.g. resources for assessment, formulation, psychoeducation, treatment processes, etc.)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Presentation of the manual should be of a high standard with clear and concise expression and correct spelling and grammar. As the manual is designed to aid fellow practitioners, it is necessary to adopt a structure and style that will practical and easy to use. Usually the preferred referencing style is that of the American Psychological Association (APA7) however given the design considerations of a professional manual the Vancouver referencing style (numbered in-text citations) are also acceptable here.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The use of generative AI is not permitted in this assessment piece.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
