A FALP is tailored to the individual student to provide opportunities to improve on and/or demonstrate achievement of the learning objective not met in the performance assessment. The FALP may include a repeat of up to 50% of the total rotation time for students who receive a “Does not meet standard” in one or two categories and up to 100% for students who receive a “Does not meet standard” for more than two categories. FALPs may also include clinical case scenarios, written assignments, HUB skills demonstrations, or oral viva-type examinations. Upon completion of a FALP and demonstration of satisfactory performance the mark in that category may be adjusted to no greater than 1.0. If the remediation is judged, by the course coordinator, to be unsuccessful, it remains a “Does not meet standard” and the student will formally fail the rotation and therefore the course, but may be eligible for a supplementary assessment.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The FALP will be provided in written form by the course coordinator to the student. It will clearly state the deficiency, remediation required and time commitment. According to the plan, the student, in consultation with the course coordinator, will be booked in for additional learning by the SVS administration team. It is the student's responsibility to actively coordinate the timings for remediation, in consultation with the appropriate staff members and VetPrac. The plan should be completed if possible no later than one week prior to final grade upload for graduation in the current year<em>. Students must make themselves available when the additional learning is offered. </em>If the plan cannot be completed prior to final course grade finalisation, students will be awarded an INC (Incomplete grade) and will need to return the following academic year to complete the course. Where this occurs, students may miss graduation for that year.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
