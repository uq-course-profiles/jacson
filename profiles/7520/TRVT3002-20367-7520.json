Based on your analysis of the tourism business's/event's current sponsorship assets, sponsorship programme, portfolio of sponsors and their match/fit with the entity, and your review of the relevant literature, determine an optimal course of action for addressing these issues. These recommendations will later inform the development of the Sponsorship Proposal. Relevant academic references/sources must be used to support your analysis and recommendations. Prepare a clear and concise <strong>2,800-3,000 word </strong>report.</p>\n<p>The scoping report will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title page (not included in the word count)</li>\n<li>Tourism business/event background: an overview of the tourism business/event and its vision, goals and experience (approximately 200 words)</li>\n<li>Markets and brand positioning (approximately 300 words)</li>\n<li>Sponsorship asset register (approximately 800 words)</li>\n<li>Sponsorship programme, portfolio, and event-sponsor match (900 words)</li>\n<li>Summary of major issues and recommendations, incluing a funding plan that involves a mix of sponsorship, fundraising techniques and/or grants for the entity (approximately 800 words) </li>\n<li>References (not included in the word count)</li>\n<li>Appendices (if any; not included in the word count)</li>\n<li>The scoping phase in designing a sponsorship proposal is critical to avoid generating and crafting solutions before a deep understanding of the tourism or event entity's current sponsorship assets, sponsorship programme, and portfolio of sponsors, and ensures that the design of the sponsor proposal capitalises on the entity's assets and provides a highly valued sponsorship package to the entity's potential sponsor (and not just a standardised offer). The task requires you to take a systematic approach and adopt critical thinking to understand the complexity of sponsorship planning and strategy development in the tourism or event context and identify meaningful resolutions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scoping report will be written in a report style, and not exceed the word limit of 3,000 words (plus references and appendices).</p>\n<p>APA (7th edition) is required for all the assessment items in this course.
