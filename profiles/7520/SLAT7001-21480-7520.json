Each part is worth 5 marks. Your final mark out of 10 will be the sum of your marks for both parts. For example, if you receive 4.25 for Part 1 and 5 for Part 2, your final mark for this assessment will be 4.25 + 5 = 9.25.</p>\n<p>There are 11 reflections and 11 PCAs, but only your best 10 from each part will count towards the full 5 marks for each. Be sure to provide evidence of your participation in class activities by including examples in your reflections. Incomplete responses will result in partial marks.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1 – PCA</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of the first section of this task is to prepare for class each week. You will be asked to read assigned readings and expected to listen to the online lecture <strong>before class that you attend</strong>. After completing the reading material and listening to the lecture, you will be taking a <strong>15-minute online activity</strong>. The format of the questions will be multiple-choice, True/False, matching, filling the blank etc. The assignment will be available on our SLAT7001 Blackboard site (before class - specific time will be shown under the relevant link on Blackboard). That means that 1) all students, irrespective of the tutorial session will use this same link to complete each assignment, and 2) you will not be able to participate in the assignment of the week after class.)</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 – Reflection</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of the second part of this task is to reflect on the weekly learning content after watching the video lectures, completing the readings and participating in the class activities. You will need to answer the questions <strong>after class that you attend</strong>.</p>\n<p>Your reflection should be thoughtful and insightful, but succinct. Please summarise your reflection on what you learned and how you think you may be able to apply them to your teaching/ learning context in <strong>150-200 words.</strong> In your reflection, please respond to the weekly<strong> <em>focus question (compulsory)</em></strong> with or without some (or all) of the following questions each week.</p>\n<p>Questions about course content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What was the most important thing you learned during the class this week?</li>\n<li>What was something you already knew or had learned but was reinforced?</li>\n<li>Write down a question or query you have concerned the topic(s) discussed.</li>\n<li>What worked well for you in class? Please explain.</li>\n<li>What didn’t work well for you in class? Please explain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional questions that you may like to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are your beliefs about teaching and learning?</li>\n<li>How have your beliefs changed? Or do you still have the same belief about teaching/learning?</li>\n<li>What other things should be covered in the course?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.
