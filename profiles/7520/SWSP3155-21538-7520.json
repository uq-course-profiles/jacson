This provides a basis for identifying the extent of your progress and any specific learning tasks that need to be completed in the remaining portion of the placement to assist you to pass the placement. Ideally this will arise from on-going discussions in supervision.</li>\n<li>The mid-placement evaluation is a progress report, and is submitted by the student on Blackboard via Turnitin. </li>\n<li>Please note: students may not receive a satisfactory rating on all learning objectives in their mid evaluation. This is normal! It simply means that students may have to do more work to complete at a satisfactory standard in a specific learning objective in the final part of placement.</li>\n<li><em>If there are serious issues which suggest the student is not on-track to pass, identified by either the Supervisor or the student, these need to be identified and discussed with the UQ Liaison Person, so that a Learning Development plan can be put in place for the second half of the placement.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aim to complete the mid-evaluation by the end of Placement week 9.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
