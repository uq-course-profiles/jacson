In this presentation, you are tasked with addressing the following project question while designing a marketing strategy for the casino: </p>\n<p><strong>“What role is the new casino expected to play in Queen’s Wharf Integrated Resort?”</strong></p>\n<p>It is not surprising to see that most large-scale resort development plans such as that of an integrated resort development are often controversial. Large resort developments are often viewed to bring both potential benefits and drawbacks to the developments associated stakeholders. Queen’s Wharf Brisbane IRD is not an exception, especially since the development includes a casino. The negative perception stems from the perspective of gambling being viewed traditionally as a vice. Therefore, as Queen’s Wharf Brisbane encompasses a footprint within the Brisbane Central Business District, the casino inclusion the IRD could be perceived as the state government acting against the traditional perceptive of gambling being vice in that it fosters numerous negative impacts (e.g., increased crime, gambling addictions). On the other hand, casino proponents would argue that the casino within Queen's Wharf Brisbane will bring considerable positive impacts (e.g., infrastructure development, lowering taxes of its residents) to the area based on the significant tax revenue derived from the new casino. Considering both perspectives, as well as the overall objectives of Queen's Wharf Brisbane, you are tasked with constructing a marketing strategy for the new casino. This marketing strategy should clearly address your perspective on the role the new casino should play within Queen's Wharf Brisbane Integrated Resort.</p>\n<p>In your presentation, you are expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Describe the new casino</strong> within Queen's Wharf Integrated Resort</li>\n<li>Evaluate <strong>social, economic, and cultural impacts</strong> anticipated from the new casino on the <strong>stakeholders,</strong> considering benefits, strengths, and opportunities (<strong>positive impacts</strong>) as well as problems and issues (<strong>negative impacts</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>Define and defend</strong> your perspective of the role you believe the new casino should play within Queen's Wharf Integrated Resort</li>\n<li>Propose <strong>a marketing strategy</strong> for the new casino. This marketing strategy should be designed to ensure the sustainability of the casino, recognise the both the positive and negative impacts identified, and reflect your perspective of the casino's designated role within Queen's Wharf Integrated Resort</li>\n<li>Identify and justify <strong>the selection of a target market</strong> in your market strategy for the casino</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assignment requires you to record your voice (audio) and appearance (video). You need to create <strong>a 15-minute (maximum) PowerPoint slideshow with video on</strong> (as you would present it to a 'live' audience). If you are unfamiliar with recording a slide show, please click <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c#OfficeVersion=Office_365_for_Windows\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>You will need to submit <strong>one (1) MS PowerPoint file</strong>. While some of you may want to create a video file (e.g., mp4 or mov format) instead of a PowerPoint file, video files tend to be large in size and uploading it to Blackboard would take longer and often results in submission failure. Thus, an MS PowerPoint file is recommended.</p>\n<p>The presentation video needs to be uploaded by the due date and time.</p>\n<p><strong>QUEEN’S WHARF BRISBANE IRD PROJECT WEBSITE</strong></p>\n<p>You can find more information about Queen's Wharf IRD project from the following government website (https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/industry/queens-wharf-brisbane).</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
