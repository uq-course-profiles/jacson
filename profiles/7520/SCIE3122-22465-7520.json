The student’s records are to document the project’s design and data in a manner that can be easily understood by another person from the same discipline. They should contain enough detail to enable another person to replicate the research. In addition to the laboratory notebook/research record, the research procedures may also be documented in a more formal summary format (similar to the Materials and Methods and/or Results sections of a paper). In some cases data may be monitored and stored on electronic devices. The student is to communicate regularly with their supervisor to ensure that their record keeping is consistent with the expectations of the discipline. Students are encouraged to use the UQ Research Data Manager (https://rdm.uq.edu.au/resources) if their supervisor advises them to do so.</p>\n<p>Student’s performance</p>\n<p>The mark for the student’s performance will be based on the supervisor's observations during the project. The marking criteria include the student’s disciplinary knowledge, inquiry skills, discipline-specific skills, and professionalism. Examples of inquiry skills include, but are not limited to, gathering relevant scientific information using databases and library and internet, extracting pertinent information from scientific papers, and participating in discussions with the supervisor and/or research group. Discipline-specific skills include, but are not limited to, generating data, collecting samples, preparing and performing experiments with care and clean up afterwards, and analysing data. Students are expected to consult with their supervisor about the skills required by their project and about the format of record keeping documentation required.
