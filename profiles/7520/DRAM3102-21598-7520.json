Participation is assessed according to the level of students' active engagement in class discussions; engagement in activities taking place within seminars, whether that be the work presented by themselves or by other students; and the alertness, enthusiasm and sophistication of analysis students bring to the full range of activities across the course. A writing seminar provides, in a certain sense, a sacrosanct space in which students expose their work to each other for public scrutiny and analysis. There is a degree of vulnerability and risk involved that demands respectful consideration and behaviour from the group at all times. Disrespectful and/or demeaning responses to students' creative work will be penalised with heavy deductions to the participation grade.</p>\n<p>Participation in out-of-hours class activities - such as play readings or theatre attendance or formative writing exercises - whilst not 'compulsory' is considered to be part of the 'spirit of the course' to which students are committed to immersing themselves.</p>\n<p>Participation will be assessed out of two marks per class, commencing Week 2 and concluding in Week 12. The total will be a mark out of 20. (Note: this span of weeks amounts to 11 classes where participation is assessed. Only students' 10 best results count toward the final tally of 20 marks.)</p>\n<p><strong>Lateness, because it disrupts group concentration and tight scheduling during writing workshops, will be penalised automatically with a half mark deduction to that week's participation grade.</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person, in class.

This initial meeting constitutes the informal, 'verbal' part of your dramaturgical service to your playwright.</p>\n<p>By way of 'formal' dramaturgical service, please provide your playwright with a 3 page dramaturgical report by way of response to the public (i.e. in-class) reading of the first draft of their play script. Using techniques introduced to you during the course, you are to read your playwright's script, and provide them with a detailed feedback report that provides useful practical information about how to make the script better in further redrafts. As well as providing your own detailed textual analysis and suggestions, you need to collate and summarise the seminar reading group's feedback in the week that your playwright's script is read aloud. Present this summarised information of class feedback (of approximately one page) AND your own 2 page report to the playwright no later than a week after their play is read aloud to the group.</p>\n<p>This report is to be submitted to the tutor via Turnitin in the same week that you hand it to your playwright.</p>\n<p>The tutor will provide you with a mark out of 25.</p>\n<p>There is also a peer assessed component to this grade: your playwright will also provide you with a mark out of 5, justifying their grade and explaining how it reflects the usefulness and efficacy of your report.
