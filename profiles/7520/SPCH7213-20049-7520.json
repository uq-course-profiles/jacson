A <em>complex case</em> is defined as a case where there is more than one main issue influencing management (e.g., patient may have dysarthria and dysphagia, plus depression, plus impaired mobility); management may have required a complex multidisciplinary approach; or perhaps there are additional social or psychosocial issues that made management complex and required you to do something different in order to optimise treatment for this child/adult (e.g., family issues, service issues, resource difficulties). There are no set criteria for determining what represents a complex case – however, a 4 year old child with 2-3 sounds in error which rapidly resolve is NOT suitable.</p>\n<p>All students must play a role in developing the presentation, and in presenting on the day. There will be 10 minutes for questions, and responses to questions will contribute to the mark received.</p>\n<p>The marking criteria are available on Blackboard and<strong> </strong>should be used to help structure the presentation.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
