If you decide to work in pairs you are encouraged to execute the last piece of assessment (Political Communication Campaign) with the same partner. During the first and second tutorial students will select partners and themes.</p>\n<p><strong>The task: </strong>You are asked to research and present one of the themes discussed in weekly lectures from weeks 1 to 10.<strong> You will use an \"argument map\" to develop the topic and its pitch. </strong>You will prepare an in-class presentation that will take place in tutorials between weeks 5 and 11 (ideally 2 groups/individuals per week - max. 3). You will select one of the topics discussed by the lecturer during one of the previous weeks to the week when you aim to present.<strong> </strong>If a topic needs to be presented by two groups/individuals, it should be approached from a different angle, or sub-theme.<strong> </strong>What matters is that the approach to the topic is original or authentic, from a different perspective to the way it was presented in the lecture. The originality of the presentation will be provided by two items: (a) explaining how the argument map was used to develop the presentation (b) an original real-life case or example from Australia or other country of your choice (as a way of illustration or support). Further instructions and exercises about the argument map and examples in lecture and tutorials, and on Blackboard.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>This assignment involves two tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>A 7-minute oral pitch</strong> whereby students will use the argument map (graphically presented in a slide) to provide a well-informed and supported critical reflection about the selected theme/concept/topic. <strong>Students will be the 'experts', the teachers</strong>. The aim is to trigger an in-class discussion about the suitability, relevance, and/or usefulness of the chosen theme to understand today's political communication events. <strong>Presenters should be prepared to answer questions from their peers and tutor.</strong> Students will support the content in their presentations on three sources: (a) weekly recommended academic reading<strong>;</strong> (b) <strong>a real-life case or example </strong>drawn from recognised news media journalistic outlets and/or government documents, from Australia or other country, that is relevant or illustrates the concept. <strong>You must avoid using the same examples used in the lecture</strong>; and, (c) <strong>you must explain the concept using the '</strong><a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/digital-essentials/choosing-the-right-tool/study-tools\"><strong>argument/mind map</strong></a><strong>' (pasted to a word doc or slide). </strong>This map may be done by hand (and copied to the slide) or via digital tools that will be provided in the lecture. The mind map will be evaluated through the 'knowledge' criterion' in the rubric. Presentations will be recorded.</li>\n<li><strong>The same pitch in writing</strong>, fully referenced (APA) and <strong>illustrated by your mind map pic and other relevant visuals</strong> (e.g., from the example used). This paper must be submitted via Turnitin. Note that a 7-minute presentation is equivalent to approximately 1000 words or two pages (approximate equivalence). More information on Blackboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: <strong>You must include a minimum of three academic references whereby your must demonstrate your direct engagement with some of the course readings. </strong>The written version will be submitted via Turnitin. Team members submit the same paper. Please write the team members’ full names and surnames (as in the class list) on the cover, your topic and presentation week on the report’s cover. Although team members will submit the same report, they must submit the assignment individually (Turnitin does not facilitate group submissions). </p>\n<p><strong>Note 2: </strong>We will practice this assignment in tutorials where we will compare the quality and accuracy of real life political communication cases found via generative AI vs. cases found via traditional research (mainly by researching the academic and professional literature). We understand that you may use content that may involve AI and/or Machine Translation (MT) tools in your presentation. All, the literature, AI and MT tools MUST be referenced (APA 7th) when you use them in your assignment.<strong> A failure to reference academic literature, AI and MT tools may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recording of Oral and Practical Assessment</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>All presentations will be recorded for marking purposes via recording facilities available where the assessment takes place (eg. ECHO360, Zoom, camera device)  </li>\n<li>Recordings will be retained by the School of Communication and Arts for at least 12 months from the release of the final grade for the course.  </li>\n<li>Recordings will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed by authorised school staff for the purposes of: </li>\n<li>Moderation of marking;  </li>\n<li>Provision of feedback to the student(s) recorded; and/or  </li>\n<li>Re-marking following a successful re-mark application. </li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

So, based on the research input provided by assignment 3, <strong>students, in groups, will plan a communication campaign plan and propose strategies and tactics that will address their selected scenario or simulation</strong>. </p>\n<p>The aim is to develop <strong>original communication strategies</strong> <strong>that either ‘counter’ or undermine the strategies that were used in the example chosen for assignment 3, OR ‘rethink’ the strategies that were used and propose more effective and persuasive ones. This task will be informed by material provided during classes, weekly readings, guest lectures, and by the research developed for assignment 3.</strong></p>\n<p>This assignment aims to give COMU3222 students the opportunity to demonstrate the political communication knowledge, understanding and problem solving capabilities acquired during the semester by proposing effective communication strategies and tactics to effectively resolve/promote the issues posed by their chosen scenario. As the assessment is authentic and incremental, you will draw on the results of the previous assignments to <strong>craft and frame the campaign message and strategies and tactics</strong>.</p>\n<p>Students will work individually, in pairs, or in groups of three (max.) <strong>acting as communication/media consultants to the campaign</strong>. You are encouraged to work with the same partner you had for the tutorial exercise.</p>\n<p>The political communication campaign consists of a simulation of a real-life political communication campaign plan. Your written proposal will include.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: Executive summary (800 words) with the following elements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desk Research: Situation or PEST analysis of the main elements of the client’s (party, leader, or group) political communication and media context, culture, or environment.</li>\n<li>Goal(s) of the political communication campaign.</li>\n<li>Specific target audiences or stakeholders (explain and justify);</li>\n<li>The main message(s) that you aim to put across to your audiences that should ideally raise awareness and include a call to action.</li>\n<li>Outline and support the main communication strategies and tactics (e.g. media release(s), series of social media posts, blog post, events like town hall meetings, other). Include references of literature or websites used to design and support your strategy</li>\n<li>A critical reflection (a couple of paragraphs) about (a) the importance of democratic or communicative vs. populist, polarising, divisive, uncivil, and/or disruptive political campaigning, and/or (b) the relevance of news media and social platforms on democracy.</li>\n<li>You may use dot points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 2. Main tactics and channel(s) of communication or media (700 words)</strong></p>\n<p>You can select a combination of the elements outlined below:</p>\n<p>A. <strong>Media text</strong>: you are asked to write a 700-word text that may consist of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>media release; blog post; speech; podcast or video script</strong>. It can be a combination of these formats, provided it meets 700 words. If you choose to write a media release or blog post, you should include accompanying visuals, photos and/or graphs (from free-copyright sites). You are invited to employ any skills learnt via MaPs training using Adobe InDesign, WordPress, or other like Shorthand. We are open to other ideas provided the content is equivalent to 700 words.</li>\n<li><strong>A set of relevant social media posts </strong>(that add up 700 words). This may be formed, for example, by a group of Facebook / Instagram relevant posts (4 posts x 130+ words approx. each = 520+ words) and 4 linked (but differently worded) tweets of 40 words = 280 characters) = 520 + 160= 680 words Each one of these posts should be ideally illustrated by relevant copyright free pictures, table/graphs/visuals, and/or copyright free cartoon or drawing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>OR</strong></p>\n<p>B. <strong>Strategic plan for a political event or activity</strong> (town hall meeting; rally; publicity event, other) It should be a 700-word, well-illustrated Plan.

You may use dot points to outline your proposed event. You are also invited to use free copyright pictures, graphs or other visuals with data or statistics, to illustrate how the event will look like.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 1</strong>: You will briefly <strong>pitch/present</strong> the main elements of your political communication final campaign <strong>in tutorials in week 12. </strong>You will present goal, publics, message, and main political communication strategies and tactics,<strong> justifying what makes it different, original, persuasive, or effective</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note that <strong>the pitch is marked via the assignment 4 rubric (strategy item) and values 2 pts (marked by your tutor)</strong>. <strong>The feedback you will receive during the oral pitch will help you refine your final submission of the political campaign plan</strong>. The pitch can last a maximum of 15 minutes (feedback and Q&amp;As included). Bring one or two slides with some visual representation of your proposed main political strategies or insights. The presentations will be recorded (as requested by the school). More on this task via Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 2: </strong>We will practice the political communication campaign in tutorials where we will compare the quality and accuracy of AI political communication campaigns vs. traditional campaigns planned and designed by humans, based on human research and planning tools, and critical thinking. <strong>This assignment encourages students to plan the campaign themselves, strategically and critically.</strong>  </p>\n<p>However, we understand that some media strategies and assets may involve, or have embedded, AI and/or Machine Translation (MT) tools.

ECHO360, Zoom, camera device)  </li>\n<li>Recordings will be retained by the School of Communication and Arts for at least 12 months from the release of the final grade for the course.  </li>\n<li>Recordings will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed by authorised school staff for the purposes of: </li>\n<li>Moderation of marking;  </li>\n<li>Provision of feedback to the student(s) recorded; and/or  </li>\n<li>Re-marking following a successful re-mark application. </li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
