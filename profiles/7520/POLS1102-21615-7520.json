That is, preparing, engaging intelligently and contributing ideas and information. Simply turning up is NOT participation; if you attend all tutorials but never speak, you will get zero. Marks will be awarded on a week-by-week basis. One mark is available for each of the first eight tutorials and in the final tutorial, where we will expect you to show all your learning for the semester, we will award a maximum of two marks. </p>\n<p>If you know you are going to have to miss a tutorial because of illness, family problems or some other reason you need to contact your course tutor. If you have missed a tutorial because of illness and were unable to contact your tutor in advance then you must do so as soon as is possible afterwards.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are intended to evaluate a student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge.

We want you to write a statement, in essay form, about what you see when you examine your policy pack the lens of rational choice, constructivism or new institutionalism.</p>\n<p>What we are looking for from you is evidence of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>your ability to use theory to explore politics and policy;</li>\n<li>your ability to apply the core elements of essay writing (such as referencing and structuring an essay);</li>\n<li>your ability to construct an argument through 1 and 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The assignment should be written in essay format. It needs an introduction, a main body containing data, evidence and (hopefully) an argument, and a conclusion summarising all of the above. We will discuss this more in lectures and tutorials and there is a marking rubric which you should refer to but the task (essentially) is to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use either rational choice, constructivism or new institutionalism to explore your chosen policy area.</li>\n<li>Write 1100 words about this exploration in essay format.</li>\n<li>In relation to each the essay question is the same: what does [insert your chosen theory] tell us about [insert your chosen policy area]? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB.

Governance is a new term and a new discipline in political science. To study governance is to study the changing nature of the state and its attempts to steer public policy in non-traditional ways. There are some big claims at the heart of governance theory: that politics has changed radically over the past few decades, that international and private sector bodies beyond our control now shape public policy, and that we cannot really hold anyone accountable for policy problems. Big bold claims but are they true? We will discuss these issues and then look at how governance perspectives can help us unravel and explain aspects of disaster management. I will do this by focusing specifically on the Queensland floods of 2010-11, first from a government point of view and, second, from a victims perspective.</p>\n<p>Attend this lecture if you wish to explore governance in Yeronga..</p></p><p><strong>Learning outcomes:</strong> L01, L02</p></div></td>",
