AI-Generated Output: </strong>Use an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT) to prepare a 800-word write-up including the following:<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>1) Briefly describe the nature and characteristics of the chosen case.</p>\n<p>2) Explain which microeconomic model is suitable for the case you choose.</p>\n<p>3) Describe the case using the model you determine above by using the tools you learned in this course and the characteristics of the case.</p>\n<p>4) Describe the predicted outcome of this problem (solve the model -- computational tools are allowed). </p>\n<p>5) Analyse and discuss the predicted outcome and whether the case has reached/is expected to reach the predicted outcome. </p>\n<p>6) Provide and discuss a policy relevant to your case.  </p>\n<p><strong>Part II. Critical Analysis (Evaluation &amp; Reflection): </strong>Write a 400-word write-up based on the AI generated write up including the following:<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) </strong>Does the AI correctly describe the case, choose a suitable model, and apply the correct solution concept?</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Is the description and details of the model AI provides consistent with what you have learned in the course?</p>\n<p><strong>3) </strong>Is the solution and the (predicted) outcome of the problem AI provided correct? Explain, if not provide the correct solution.</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Is AI's policy and its discussion related to the real-world problem you have?</p>\n<p><strong>5) </strong>Explain the limitations of the AI. Can it handle the complex economic problems, can it prove a general statement related to your case?</p>\n<p><strong>6)</strong> Overall, would you trust AI-generated case study and analysis in real-life? Suggest ways AI could be improved for use in economic and strategic decision-making.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI or MT: </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
