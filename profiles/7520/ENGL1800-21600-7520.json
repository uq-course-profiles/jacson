We strongly recommend you attend all tutorials, because this is where you will learn core skills in literary studies, engage in rich conversations about books and ideas, and develop peer review skills. </strong>This assessment item is designed to reward preparation (reading the set texts and reviewing the reading guide before class). It will help students to summarise key analytical points and generate ideas for further discussion. This work is designed to give students a starting point that they can return to later, to practise key skills, and to provide opportunities to track their progress with generalised feedback.</p>\n<p>Students are required to participate for the full duration of the tutorial. By attending tutorials and actively engaging with the week's management of learning work, you can earn <strong>up to 25% towards your final grade. </strong>This provides your tutor with a chance to identify any problems you may be having in the course, and provide basic, regular feedback. <strong>From Week 1 onwards, participating in a tutorial by completing the week's reading log entry (an in-class assessment task) will earn you up to 2 marks per reading log</strong>, <strong>and submitting and participating in a close reading essay plan workshop in the Week 4 tutorial will earn you up to 5 marks (total 25 marks).</strong></p>\n<p>Your reading log entries should be 100-150 words each (not including the question you are responding to) and take the form of a critical reflection on your reading of the week's texts. It needs no argument or formal structure, but <strong>must include at least one quotation from the text. </strong>This work is marked on a <strong>pass/fail</strong> basis. We will demonstrate how to submit these in our early lectures and tutorials. A separate task-sheet for the essay plan will be circulated at the beginning of semester.</p>\n<p>Complete your Reading Log assessment in class through Blackboard -&gt; Learning Resources each week from Week 1 <strong>except Week 4</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>A 300 word close reading essay plan is your reading log task in Week 4</strong>. Students must write and develop an essay plan as part of a tutorial workshop in week 4. As part of the workshop you will engage in consultation with your tutor. No extensions are possible since part of your grade is participating in the workshop. This learning activity ensures you are on track for your close reading essay and most students find this process an invaluable part of their learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking</strong>:  </p>\n<p>Reading log grades and feedback will consider textual analysis and writing skills. This assignment is marked on a pass/fail basis.  </p>\n<p><strong>What if I am sick and can't attend my tutorial?</strong> </p>\n<p>You must contact your tutor before your scheduled tutorial with the <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension?p=1#1\">evidence required by UQ for an extension</a> (e.g. a medical certificate).
