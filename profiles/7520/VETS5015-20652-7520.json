The final marks for each category will be the average of each assessor and summed across the categories for the final mark. Students who score at least a “Meets standard” (an average of &gt; or equal to 1.0) in all categories pass the rotation. Students who score a “Does not meet standard” (an average of &lt;1.0) for any category will be required to undertake a “Formalised additional learning plan” (FALP). The FALP may include a repeat of up to 50% of the total rotation time for students who receive a “Does not meet standard” in one or two categories and up to 100% for students who receive a “Does not meet standard” for more than two categories. Upon completion of a FALP and demonstration of satisfactory performance, the mark in that category may be adjusted to no greater than 1.0. If the remediation is judged, by the course coordinator, to be unsuccessful, it remains a “Does not meet standard” and the student will formally fail the rotation and therefore the course but may be eligible for a supplementary assessment.</p>\n<p>The FALP will be described in a one-page document, written by the course coordinator in collaboration with the student. It will clearly state the deficiency, remediation required and time commitment. It will be signed by the course coordinator and student to serve as a formal confirmation of the required training. According to the plan the student, in consultation with the course coordinator, will be booked in for additional learning by the SVS administration team. The plan should be completed if possible no later than one week before final grade upload for graduation in the current year<em>. Students must make themselves available when the additional learning is offered.</em> If the plan cannot be completed before when they may be graded, students will be awarded an INC (Incomplete grade) and may miss graduation for that year.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
