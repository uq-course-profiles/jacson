A ~ 2000 word research proposal (about 6.5 – 8.5 pages double-spaced, word count does not include the reference list) on your independent research topic will contribute 15% to the assessment for this subject. </p>\n<p>The assignment has three objectives:  </p>\n<p>(1) to get you reading the primary scientific literature on work others have done on or close to the research topic you have chosen, </p>\n<p>(2) to help you to plan your research project in detail and </p>\n<p>(3) to give you skills and experience in the writing of research proposals. </p>\n<p>Your proposal should be divided into four main sections.</p>\n<p>1)    Background - You should start your proposal with a broad introduction to the QUESTION being addressed (e.g., how animals might respond to predator cues, how mothers and young keep track of each other, how boldness affects habitat use…) and what is known about this question in a range of animals, then make the focus narrower in the subsequent paragraphs. This section will include a critical synthesis of the relevant literature to place the proposed project in the context of other work done in the field, and the gaps in knowledge that still exist.</p>\n<p>2)    Aims and Significance of the study – this section should present the fundamental question(s) that will be addressed. Describe <strong>why your study is critical (how it will advance our knowledge of this aspect of animal behaviour and fill in some of the detailed knowledge gaps) and what your detailed aims are</strong>. You could also end with a paragraph about why your study species is suitable for addressing this question.</p>\n<p>3)    Research Plan and Methods – <strong>this section should show clearly how each aim will be addressed, in sufficient detail for the reader to assess the likelihood that the research will be successful</strong>.  You need to explain exactly what data you will collect, how those data will be collected, and how they will be analyzed. You need to provide enough detail on the proposed methods for the reader to be able to decide whether your data and data analysis will achieve the aims of the study (i.e., answer the questions you set out to answer).</p>\n<p>4)    References cited - You should list all the references cited in the proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of the literature</strong></p>\n<p>Research proposals should cite original scientific literature (journal articles and chapters from edited books), rather than general texts and websites.  A few key references were supplied for each suggested topic. Still, you <strong>must</strong> show evidence of wider reading and your <strong>own </strong>library research (i.e., we will expect you to cite about ten or more additional relevant journal articles that you found yourself).  It is rarely appropriate to get material from the internet for a research project, and we will not accept references to websites in place of appropriate journal articles.  This is because anyone can post things on the internet; there is no reviewing process to provide quality control, as there is with scientific journal articles.  In some cases, citations of websites might be appropriate in addition to those of journals.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
