Students will organise themselves as a team to manage this initial phase of the project successfully. They will start by exploring existing resources on the given theme to develop an understanding of context and identify specific design problem(s). Each group will plan, lead, and document a co-design workshop involving key stakeholders to deepen their understanding of the problem(s) and propose a series of possible design interventions aiming to improve upon the current situation.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure progress throughout the semester, students are required to submit outputs weekly via a shared digital document. The final submission compiles all weekly outputs into a comprehensive PDF design report titled Co-Designing Aged Care Communities: Research &amp; Proposition submitted via Turnitin on Blackboard. The report is mostly visual and should include a concise commentary throughout to document early stages of the design process. That is; the evolution of ideas, from research to ideation, based on studio activities and feedback. Each activity should be briefly introduced. Key learnings, outcomes, and implications of activities for the project should be clearly outlined.</p>\n<p>Group work - This assignment is group-based. Students will assess each other using a Peer-Evaluation digital form available via Blackboard. The results of this evaluation will be taken into account in calculating each students' mark for this assignment.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.

The Developed Design assignment is a comprehensive evaluation of your ability to apply your design knowledge and skills to develop a comprehensive and refined design solution. This assignment focuses on assessing your capability to translate conceptual ideas into a tangible and well-executed design outputs, showcasing your ability to apply design methods, use creativity in problem-solving, and effectively communicate design ideas. While the outputs are not prescribed as these will vary depending on the design problem addressed, it is expected that the students produce good quality design visuals and prototypes to communicate their ideas effectively.</p>\n<p>Concept development will involve iterative design processes using sketching, visualisations, prototyping, and user scenarios. Process work will be submitted via Weekly Outputs in a shared digital document. Once developed, the design solution will be articulated through a presentation to stakeholders. Students will submit their presentation slides as a PDF document via Blackboard and present their work in class. Based on feedback, students will make final modifications and produce a poster summarising key aspects of the design solution (digital PDF submission via Blackboard, printed hard-copy submission due in class). Weekly outputs will be documented and submitted to demonstrate evidence of process work.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
