The focus is on rethinking the community centre within its broader landscape, enhancing water and climate resilience while integrating additional and existing structures. </p>\n<p>Assignment 1 (A01) is a concept design proposal that will be progressed and finalised in Assignment 2 (A02). Students get engaged in active learning through workshops, site-visits and mapping sessions, model-making, and studio-based activities to develop and finalise their design. On a weekly basis, tutorials sessions are structured to support teamwork and individual projects. The students’ task is to enhance the community centre’s interaction with the street, adjacent green areas and surrounding community, encouraging social engagement and broad usage of the facilities: multifunctional spaces adaptable to various activities and resilient to variable environmental conditions. Students visit, survey, and analyse the site and its broader urban, environmental and social context; they refine the general brief and complete a massing study for the addition to the existing building of a new inhabitable structure for community activities. They re-arrange the site within and beyond its current boundaries, identifying strategies to integrate it in the broader landscape and water network. The existing built volume is to be spatially and functionally extended with a new three storey pavilion. Its main function is to provide additional space for community activities (level 1), host a self-contained apartment for the community centre’s caretaker (level 2), and floodable facilities at the ground level to be publicly accessible. Existing and new volumes must be formally and functionally integrated through a climate responsive building skin (surface), which create opportunities for interstitial space while enhancing the community centre’s iconic presence in the suburb. The pavilion, whose volume is limited to 50 sqm footprint and a height of 9 m, must be located based on contextual and functional analysis, considering its relationship to the site (flooding), street (access and visibility) and broader landscape (usability).</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The aim is to refine and articulate their design into a compelling, cohesive narrative, emphasising the interconnectedness of the centre with its social and environmental context. The community centre, comprising an existing building and a new pavilion, should be treated as a dynamic ensemble of 'spatial conditions' seamlessly linked to its site. This 'spatial narrative' must be developed to reflect the following components:</p>\n<p>•\t<em>Integration with surrounding landscape and water network</em>. Enhanced relationship between the centre and its natural environment, incorporating water management and ecological design features that underscore resilience against climate change.</p>\n<p>•\t<em>Harmonisation of old and new architecture</em>. Seamless formal and spatial integration of the new extension with the existing structure, preserving its tectonic character while offering adaptable features that meet the centre's functional needs.</p>\n<p>•\t<em>Engagement with public spaces</em>. Strengthened connection between the community centre and public spaces (streets and adjacent green areas), fostering accessibility and community involvement through spaces that are welcoming and versatile for various community activities.</p>\n<p>Through model-making and studio-based activities students will test and refine their design concepts, focusing on cross sectional exploration of spatial and material solutions. They participate in weekly tutorials for expert feedback and guidance in refining their design approach.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
