The activity should be engaging, interactive and based on a student-centred, constructivist approach to education. The activity can be 20-60 minutes in length. You do not need to design a whole lesson, just one activity. The one activity might have an introductory section, a middle part, and a conclusive section that might include a quick assessment to check for learning.</p>\n<p>The assignment has two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Activity Plan</strong></p>\n<p>You will design an activity plan using a template provided to you on Blackboard. The activity plan will be approximately 500 – 600 words. You will need to provide a description of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The context for the activity, where and how it should be done, what knowledge domain it is in (e.g. science, literacy etc) and any other critical information that other teachers would need to know in advance of implementing the activity. You may reference the Australian Curriculum or Queensland Syllabus documents. </li>\n<li>The intended learning outcomes of the activity - what do you think the primary students will be able to do or understand at the end of the activity</li>\n<li>The resources required for the activity - paper, URLs, skipping ropes.....anything in terms of technical materials and sources of information that you will need to do this activity with your students</li>\n<li>A description of what students will be doing - what will you ask the primary students to do at each phase of the activity, will they work alone or in groups/with partners, will there be opportunities to self-check on their progress, and so on. </li>\n<li>An outline of the support that the teacher will provide while students complete the activity - how you will help students do the activity, how you will introduce and guide the activity, and check on students' progress. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Design justification</strong></p>\n<p>The second part of the assignment involves you providing a justification for the design of your activity plan. This section will be approximately 1000 – 1200 words. In this section, you will need to cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A description of the learning and development theories that underpins your design (design: the decisions you took when developing the activity)</li>\n<li>A justification for why the development and learning theories were chosen - provide specific details of theory concepts, ideas and strategies </li>\n<li>An explanation of HOW you have drawn on the theories to inform the decisions you made in designing the activity - provide specific details of theory concepts, ideas and strategies </li>\n<li>The range of teaching strategies that will need to be employed during the activity</li>\n<li>A justification for the resources selected for use in the activity</li>\n<li>A reflection on what this task has helped you to understand about how learning and development theories inform practice</li>\n<li>Consider student diversity for all of the above (differentiation)</li>\n<li>A minimum of four references should be used to support your justification</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

To assist you in maintaining momentum in your course, you are required to complete 6 journal entry reflections that are tied to the learning in this course, submitted online during semester. These form part of your final assignment, due on 24 May, <strong>but will not be marked during semester</strong>. You will receive feedback on your first reflection to point out weaknesses and strengths of your reflection. <strong>The five following reflections will not receive feedback.</strong> </p>\n<p>In order to achieve in this assessment, you will need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Participate in all weekly lectures, workshops and tutorials (including preparation of weekly readings for class discussion).  </li>\n<li>Complete your journal entry reflections at regular intervals throughout the Semester (as outlined below). </li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will be provided with question throughout the semester in line with the topics we will cover. For each of the topics below, you will write 200-250 word journal entries in response to each of the question and add at least one specific reference to course readings you have read in the preparation of your reflection. This may include a chapter/excerpt from your textbook and/or a reading from the course reading list. The reference is not included in the word count. <strong>Please note: your journal entry reflections need to be based on readings, lectures and tutorials in this course. Please reflect on what you have encountered in this course, and how you might have experienced learning situations yourself that remind you of the concepts, ideas and theories you have read or learnt about in this course.  </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Week 2:</strong> What are the most important elements of learning theories that teachers may need to support their educational practices? </li>\n<li><strong>Week 3: </strong>Why is it important for educators to be aware of, and understand current research evidence on how children and adolescents develop and learn?</li>\n<li><strong>Week 6:</strong> What aspects of cognitive and physical development will teachers take account of, when designing learning experiences for students in primary schools? Provide brief examples.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 7: </strong>Which aspect(s) of social/emotional development do you think will be a key to understanding your students, when you are in the classroom? Justify your choices with brief examples.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 11:</strong> Identify the key influences on children's development. How might teachers respond to the diversity of development among students in primary classrooms, to promote optimal outcomes for all individuals?</li>\n<li><strong>Week 12:</strong> To what extent and in what ways can current research on how the brain and mind learn, contribute to design of effective educational practices for children in primary school? How might you ensure that you make best use of research evidence?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Your journal entry reflections are due on Fridays by 2pm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It is important to remember to submit each journal entry on its due date AS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO INCLUDE ANY MISSING JOURNAL ENTRIES IN YOUR FINAL ASSIGNMENT.</strong> Note that the journal entry link for week 2 will not be available after Friday of week 2, the journal entry link for week 6 will not be available after Friday of week 6 etc.</p>\n<p>Journal entry reflections will not be marked during the semester.
