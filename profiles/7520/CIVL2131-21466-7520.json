            "topic_description": "Laboratory experiments Students are required to attend four different laboratory classes during the semester. Sign up via mySI-net. Students must complete all four practical classes to pass the course and make up any missed classes by the end of week 12. Laboratory classes will run between Weeks 4 - 13 from 2pm - 5pm. You will conduct laboratory experiments in approved groups and produce a group report using the provided templates. You must hand in a preprac form before each lab as part of the report and assessment. Students will need to work remotely with external students and facilitate communicating the laboratory processes, data and produce a joint report. Completed group reports must be submitted to the tutor at the end of each laboratory session (and before 5.00pm). The four laboratory classes are: 1: Flow meters (FM), weeks 4 to 7 2: Sluice gate (SG), weeks 4 to 7 3: Pipe flow (PF), weeks 9 to 13 (Mon) 4: Flow drag (DC), weeks 9 to 13 (Mon) Bring a calculator and handouts/textbook. Each laboratory class will be covered in a lab introductory session in the lecture prior to the start of the laboratory. Readings/Ref: Relevant sections in the handout materials/textbook and as provided by the lecture slides.",
