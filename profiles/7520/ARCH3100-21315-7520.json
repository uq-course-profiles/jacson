Use diagrams, architectural drawings and physical models to describe site analysis, design ideas, schematic architectural plans and sections (at conventional scales), structural/ material ideas and 3D formal response to scale. More specific requirements will be circulated prior to the submission after analysis of the site and client brief. Students are encouraged to use presentation techniques that communicate design ideas and processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Although students may use AI and/or MT technologies (for example: research that informs the design), successful completion of the assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in architectural design for contexts and tasks (site and client's brief) for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment task, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of the ideas informing their design submission, independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Turnitin is accessed through the course Blackboard site. Turnitin also checks for plagiarism or instances where the original work of others is not appropriately acknowledged. Uploaded files must contain readable text and not be rasterised. Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission. To meet professional accreditation, public engagement and quality assurance obligations, digital copies of all course assessment items must be submitted in addition to any hard copy submission requirements specified in individual Course / Studio Outlines. Any physical models should be photographed and a minimum of two photographs describing the complete and full model must be included in the digital submission.  </p>",
