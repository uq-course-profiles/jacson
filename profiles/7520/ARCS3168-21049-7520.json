Students will select from four grades of taxa related to early human evolution that will be covered in the first five weeks of the course. For each taxa, students must draw and label the skeletal remains that are present from a list provided on Blackboard (e.g., cranium and mandible, femur, humerus). Each fossil specimen needs to be drawn (either physically and then scanned, or digitally with software such as Adobe Illustrator) in at least two different views - anterior and lateral (but more is acceptable) with a scale for reference. Each feature label will include information about the importance of the feature in terms of human evolution and changes in the fossil record. A short description (~250 words) of the grade must also be included, with additional information about the descriptions provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>You will have time available in the second hour of each session to examine the physical casts in the teaching laboratory. You can use illustrations from the readings as well as 3D models available online through websites such as SketchFab.com. The illustrations must be either free-hand drawings or outlines of the fossil specimen -- labelling photographs or published illustrations is NOT sufficient. The portfolio will be submitted as either a Word document or PDF online through Turn-it-in by the due date and time. </p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
