As social and academic conversations about gender continue to move beyond the binary, many developmental scientists are confronted with the fact that theories of gender development often present divergent or competing explanations of how, when and why gender develops. Regardless, parents, educators, and health professionals alike want to ensure informed, inclusive and safe developmental spaces are afforded to all children, regardless of their gender. You are contacted by Australian Psychologist and asked to write an essay that presents two theories of gender development. You can choose any two relevant theories of gender development to present. However, regardless of the theories chosen, you must rely on empirical evidence to support the theory's practical application and draw a conclusion on which of the two theories best explains gender development. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong>: The purpose of this piece of assessment is to allow you to demonstrate your ability to explain a theory, find relevant empirical research, critically evaluate evidence and formulate a convincing argument. You will have already had lecture and tutorial content related to gender development. In this essay, you must introduce two academic perspectives that are based on research. You will then incorporate additional studies to support the arguments of each side. Finally, you will discuss your own conclusion about whether you consider the theoretical perspectives to be adequately supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The essay is to be written in APA format with a word length of 2000 words excluding references. You must include a title and a reference list with all (and only) cited references noted. No abstract is required. Although this assessment piece will be discussed in general terms in your practical classes, the essay assesses your ability to work independently. Thus, you should use your library skills to locate relevant material independently. There are many different approaches possible and you will need to research some possible angles and then narrow your focus. Studies that are mentioned in the lecture on Gender Development will be a good starting point, but keep in mind that you cannot use the articles provided as starter readings on Blackboard as your main research articles. To ensure that you do not go overboard with reading, you must limit your reference list to a maximum of 10-12 references. It is better to have a thorough discussion of a few major issues than to include too many different issues and end up with a superficial discussion. Your understanding, critical thinking, and ability to communicate key issues will be assessed, as well as your integration of the literature. General essay marking criteria and guidelines are provided. The guidelines will be discussed extensively in several of your tutorials.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
