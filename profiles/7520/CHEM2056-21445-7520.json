Protective glasses must be worn in the laboratory. Appropriate footwear is also essential, as is a laboratory coat. Attendance at the laboratory is COMPULSORY. If you have a valid reason for absence (e.g. illness) you must provide appropriate documentary evidence (a medical certificate). In this case the practical will be rescheduled without penalty. If a student does not arrive on time at an allocated practical session (that is within 15 min of the allocated time) and does not provide appropriate documentation, the rescheduling of the practical session will result in a loss of 4 marks for that report (the total number of marks for this component of the course is 80 marks equivalent to 20% of the course marks). If a student does not wear appropriate footwear they cannot gain entry to the lab and a rescheduling penalty will be applied. </p>\n<p>The laboratory component in CHEM2056 has several objectives. Primarily, it aims to provide instruction in the instruments, techniques and procedures of experimental physical and surface chemistry. These techniques involve not only the use of instruments, but also the planning of experiments, the interpretation of results and the communication of experimental outcomes through writing of reports. Experiments are designed to complement concepts encountered in lectures.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
