Each lecture has readings associated with it, and you will be required to keep up with these readings on a weekly basis. After each lecture you will be given a 5-item multiple-choice quiz which will assess your knowledge of the lecture content and the required readings for that week. You need to complete the quizzes online via the Blackboard site by the due date, i.e. 1pm the day after each lecture. Each multiple choice item will have four options, with only one correct option, and you will receive a mark out of 5 for each of the quizzes. Marks from best 10 of 12 quizzes will be used in calculating your total score. Scores from 10/12 quizzes will be summed and weighted for a score out of 45. You will have 10 minutes to complete each quiz and you will only be able to take each quiz once. You will see each question once and will not be able to go back to questions presented earlier within each quiz. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

This assessment aims to help you develop in communicating, familiarising with the online context of parenting and analysing information presented to parents. You can choose any website which has relevance to parenting, however it does not have to be a website about parenting specifically. You may choose either government websites or those provided by not-for-profit or commercial entities. The website does not have to be based in Australia, but if it is not, it must be targeted at Australian parents.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The task is to present your findings at your allocated tutorial. Try to make your presentation as interesting as possible. <strong>Each student </strong>needs to submit a copy of the presentation slides via the Blackboard site by the due date (and please note that this is not necessarily the same, as the day you will present).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The presentation needs to address the following elements:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the website about? Provide a description of the website and its aims. Give sufficient detail to ensure the audience understands what the website is designed for. Describe who the website is developed/supported by – for example indicate whether it is a government website, a discussion board or a commercial site. Provide a link to the relevant websites or documents.</li>\n<li>Who is the target audience of the website and who uses the website? Describe who the website is aimed at and discuss groups or populations that are excluded. Provide any information on website use, for example websites may indicate how many members they have or how many parents access their website. Consider whether the stated targets of the website match the actual users.</li>\n<li>How is the website relevant for parents? Describe the type of information and/or support parents are likely to gain from the website. Consider any potential harms which may arise from parents accessing the website.</li>\n<li>What are the strengths and limitation of the website? Describe the features of the website that are more or less effective. For example, consider the extent to which the website is user friendly, promotes equality, any scientific evidence which has been used to guide its development, moderator policies.</li>\n<li>Summary and recommendations: Discuss relevant recommendation with regards to the website. For example, provide a summary of how the website could be improved and/or extended.</li>\n</ol>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
