The tutor may also decide to extend the discussion time in class if this seems useful.</p>\n<p>(2) One of the presenters, on behalf of the group, will post to Turnitin a summary or transcription of the presentation given in class (<strong>fully referenced</strong>). The written transcription/summary is to be posted to Turnitin by 5pm a week after the tutorial presentation. The exception is for presentations in Week 13: the transcriptions/summaries for these will be due at 5pm on Wednesday 4 June. The transcription/summary should be from 1000-1,500 words. PLEASE READ THE CRITERIA CAREFULLY AS THESE REFER BOTH TO THE ORAL PRESENTATION AND TO THE WRITTEN TRANSCRIPTION/SUMMARY OF THAT PRESENTATION (IN PART FOR INTEGRITY PURPOSES). </p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ON AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
