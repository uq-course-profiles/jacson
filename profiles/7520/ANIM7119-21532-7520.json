Across these varied roles, horses have served humans for centuries, contributing to livelihoods, economies, and cultural traditions. However, the close relationship between humans and horses has also created complex ethical dilemmas, as the needs and welfare of horses often intersect with economic pressures, cultural practices, and societal values.</p>\n<p>Ethical concerns arise in many aspects of equine industries, reflecting broader questions about human responsibility toward animals. These dilemmas challenge us to think critically about how to balance human interests with the welfare of horses and the preservation of ecosystems. Such issues are rarely black and white, requiring consideration of multiple perspectives, including the ethical, economic, and cultural dimensions of equine use and management.</p>\n<p><strong>Task</strong></p>\n<p>In this assignment, you will examine a specific ethical dilemma within the equine industries, using critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning to analyse the issue and propose practical, ethically sound solutions. Through this process, you will develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of equine management and their role as advocates for responsible and sustainable practices in the industry.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Further guidelines and detail on this assessment item will be provided on the course Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI use</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
