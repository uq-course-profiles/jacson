What are a person’s or people’s everyday activities (data of which can be easily collected) expected to be relatable to the patterns, and why? What kind of benefit can the hidden patterns be used for? Are there REAL DEMANDS for these benefits?</li>\n<li>Datafication: a) technical strategy to collect relevant data (working with existing mobile apps, or developing its own user interface?), b) discursive strategy to mobilize people’s participation in data collection or donation (what kind of social benefits could be emphasized for people’s voluntary sacrifice of a little bit of their data privacy)</li>\n<li>Application: a simple scenario of SUPERVISED machine learning explaining how the collected data will be used and what kind of pattern recognition or prediction the learned algorithmic model can make, and explanations on how this model can provide promised benefits to the users.</li>\n<li>Critical Evaluation: What are the possible limitations of the proposed data collection methods? For instance, are there certain groups of people whose interests are less likely to be represented in the data?
