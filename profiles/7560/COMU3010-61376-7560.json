Of course, you are encouraged to do all nine and we will use the result of your best seven to calculate your mark. Typically each task is made up of either multiple choice or true/false questions. These tasks help you assess your understanding of the weekly readings which are all contained in the compulsory and recommended books for this course. These tasks help you assess your understanding of the weekly readings and seminar content. Many of the questions asked in these tasks relate to: 1) the topic of a chapter/paper/seminar, 2) the argument made in a chapter/paper/seminar, 3) the theories used or cited in a chapter/paper/seminar, 4) the methods used or cited in each chapter/paper/seminar, 5) the concepts developed in a chapter/paper/seminar, 6) the types of data used in each chapter/paper/seminar, and 7) the contribution of a chapter/paper to the field of sociolinguistics.</p>\n<p><strong>Tasks open on Monday at 9am and are due on Friday 2pm each week.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WEEK 1 </strong></p>\n<p>Chapter 1 of Blommaert, J.

These books are in the learning resources under “Course Reading List”. These books build upon the work we cover in the semester. You need to write a critical evaluation of its worth. Reviews focus on how the book adds to what we already know about topic (e.g. Does it tell us something new? Does it provide us with a new way of looking at old problems?)</p>\n<p>The marking rubric for this task presents you with a guideline on the types of things you need to cover in your review. You can find this rubric in the assessment folder in the blackboard site for this subject. You can use this criteria sheet to assess your own work once you think it is finished and do a practice run. Alternatively, you might like to work with another student and use the marking criteria sheet to assess and provide feedback to each other. Doing this will also help you further refine your review. If you are unsure of what the categories mean or what is entailed in doing a review, then it is recommended that you read pages 126-137 and 199-212 of Hay, I., Bochner, D., and Dungey, C. 2012. <em>Making the Grade: A Guide to Successful Communication and Study (4th Edition)</em>. Melbourne: Oxford University Press. If you are still unsure of the task after reading the guide, then please come and see me and/or ask in class.</p>\n<p>When you write your review, please include headings covering Description, Analysis, and Evaluation. To get some idea of what a finished review looks like you might like to look at number of book reviews found in international academic journals in this field. Such journal include <em>Language in Society</em>, <em>Journal of Sociolinguistics</em>, <em>Journal of Linguistic Anthropology</em>, <em>Language and Communication</em>, <em>Signs and Society</em>. All are available online in the library.</p>\n<p>Length: <strong>1200 words</strong></p>\n<p>Format: 12pt font, 2.5cm margins, double-spaced.

The first relates to your take-home from one of the chapters from the online tasks. The second relates to the take home from your book review assignment. The third relates to the take home from doing your research project presentation, while the fourth relates to the take home from one of your peers’ presentations in terms of what you learned about potential research topics on language in social life. Each reflection is worth 1.5 marks. So, 10x1.5% = 15%.
