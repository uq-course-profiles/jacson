The government has convened an independent review in preparation for policy change in a key area (it is up to you to choose the country/jurisdiction and the policy area/issue). The review has already published an initial report highlighting key the nature of the problems at hand, now it wishes to consider possible solutions.</p>\n<p>It has asked you to prepare a short report, investigating lessons that can be drawn from another country or jurisdiction that is facing the same challenge. Your report should address the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The approach taken in the chosen jurisdiction and its strengths and weaknesses.</li>\n<li>Specific lessons that can be drawn e.g. regarding causes of success/failure.</li>\n<li>The applicability of these lessons to your jurisdiction. Could the same approach be tried? What would need to be changed?</li>\n<li>Limitations of your analysis.</li>\n<li>Recommendations for next steps to be taken by the government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Part B: Oral hurdle</strong></p>\n<p>This report is accompanied by a pass/fail hurdle to ensure that the learning objectives have been achieved. Following submission, students will discuss their assignment with the course coordinators (usually for no more than 10 minutes). These will occur during Week 13 of the course.</p>\n<p>The oral response will be recorded for purposes of appeal. The oral response forms no part of the grade or marking process.</p>\n<p>If the marker is satisfied that the learning objectives have been met, then the essay will be marked.</p>\n<p>If the marker is not satisfied, then student receives a fail for the task, and an overall 3 (marginal fail or ‘S’ = Supplementary) or less for the course.
