This presentation should be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>20 minutes in length</li>\n<li>Combine video, images, speech and text</li>\n<li>Observe fair use provisions for copyright materials</li>\n<li>Clearly demonstrate, and credit all members of the group in specific roles (for example, presenting, editing, research, graphics).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The presentation will be made using the Zoom platform in the Week 10 tutorials. Groups should familiarise themselves with the chat, gallery view and screen sharing functions that will enable them to make an effective presentation in the Zoom platform. A portion of tutorial time each week will be dedicated to the research, planning and preparation for the final presentations.</p>\n<p>The Zoom presentation will include a Q&amp;A session with the entire class. Aptitude in the Q&amp;A session will be part of the assessment, and constitute 5% of the available 35% mark for this assessment. Students who fail to attend the presentations of other groups in their class will forfeit their Q&amp;A marks.</p>\n<p>The following world regions may be chosen for this assignment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Africa (or sub-region)</li>\n<li>Asia (or sub-region)</li>\n<li>Australasia</li>\n<li>Europe (or sub-region)</li>\n<li>South America</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tone of the presentation should be informative, although it must include critical questioning and original commentary. The focus should be upon the region in question, although this may include, where necessary, explanation through comparison with other regions.</p>\n<p>The presentation should be clearly informed by substantive empirical research (whether through reading, data analysis, online observation or collection of visual materials). All research and secondary materials should be referenced in a credits sequence (or document), along with the roles of each of the group members.</p>\n<p>The practical focus of this assessment is upon researching configurations of the digital environments across the different cultures of the world and presenting findings effectively to an audience.</p>\n<p>The academic aim of the exercise is to identify and explain some of the specific features of a digital culture in a major world region, in terms of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Local data on digital access, infrastructure, content and user participation.</li>\n<li>Prevailing cultural norms such as language, beliefs, aesthetics and taste</li>\n<li>Three examples of local practices of digital culture</li>\n<li>Identifying culturally-specific issues, applications or usage</li>\n<li>Concluding with a summary of observable trends in the evolution of this digital culture</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Composition of groups:</strong></p>\n<p>Students will be assigned to groups in their second tutorial. Each group must allocate specific production roles within the group by Week 3 and supply a list of the group roles to the class tutor – who will otherwise assign roles.</p>\n<p><strong>AI/MT use: </strong></p>\n<p>The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Recording of Oral and Practical Assessment:</strong></p>\n<p>All presentations will be recorded for marking purposes via recording facilities available where the assessment takes place (eg. ECHO360, Zoom, camera device)</p>\n<p>Recordings will be retained by the School of Communication and Arts for at least 12 months from the release of the final grade for the course.</p>\n<p>Recordings will be stored in a secure manner and will only be accessed by authorised school staff for the purposes of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderation of marking;</li>\n<li>Provision of feedback to the student(s) recorded; and/or</li>\n<li>Re-marking following a successful re-mark application</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
