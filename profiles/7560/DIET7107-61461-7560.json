Students analyze the food science principles underlying their modifications and provide practical recommendations for clients, including preparation ease and cost considerations. The report includes comprehensive sections on aims, methods, results, analysis, and conclusions, with emphasis on translating nutrition science into practical dietary advice. This assessment develops critical skills in recipe modification, client-centred nutrition counselling, and understanding the intersection of food science with therapeutic nutrition practice. The Dietary Modification report outcomes will include comments on information that can be provided to clients about preparing modified recipes as well as links to planetary health.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
