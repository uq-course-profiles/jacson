This course aims to introduce you to the principles of scientific communication, a highly valuable and transferrable style where precision, conciseness and evidence-based reasoning can greatly enhance how you communicate ideas. For the Osmosis, Action Potential and Skeletal Muscle practicals, <strong>you will produce a report structured</strong> around the conventions of scientific communication to help you apply course objectives and prepare you for future studies and careers after university.</p>\n<p>A range of <strong>resources </strong>to aid your understanding of conventions in scientific writing will be available in Blackboard prior to each practical class - these can be found in the Skills &amp; Assessment Guides folder and in the folder for each specific practical module. Engaging with these materials before, during and after your practical class will be very valuable for developing and improving your skills in writing the practical reports.</p>\n<p>To complete the Osmosis, Action Potential and Skeletal Muscle practical report, you will work through a series of experiments during practical classes to populate content within a report template file provided for you in Blackboard. Videos about the experiments and other scientific methods like procedures and controls, are available to complement this task. You will then have <strong>48 hours from the end of your Group's practical class to complete and submit your report</strong> via the submission link for your prac Group in the Assessment section of Blackboard. Upon submission, <strong>you will need to generate a digital Turnitin receipt</strong> confirming your work has been successfully submitted; proof of submission will be accepted only by providing this digital receipt so make sure to always check that you have received this.</p>\n<p>During classes, you will work in small collaborative teams of 2-3 students to complete experiments; as such, the Hypothesis, Methods and Results sections of your reports can be same/similar amongst group members though you are encouraged to make improvements to these sections individually as you think is necessary. The <strong>Discussion section of the report must however, be your own individual work</strong>. To complete the Discussion section, you will need to spend some time revising course content or reading other reputable sources such as textbooks and journal articles in order to answer the questions in this section.</p>\n<p>Please note, <strong>it is not possible to attend a different practical Group</strong> to the one you are allocated to. If you miss your scheduled practical class for any reason, you will need to complete the associated assessment by your Group's due date, using the resources available in Blackboard. Data for the Osmosis, Action Potential, Skeletal Muscle and Plant practicals can be obtained from your group members or by contacting the practical coordinator.</p>\n<p><strong>Due dates for Skeletal Muscle practical report for each Group</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>G12 - 12noon 9/10/25</li>\n<li>G1 - 4pm 9/10/25</li>\n<li>G2 - 12noon 10/10/25</li>\n<li>G3 - 4pm 10/10/25</li>\n<li>G4 - 12noon 11/10/25</li>\n<li>G5 - 4pm 11/10/25</li>\n<li>G6 - 12noon 12/10/25</li>\n<li>G7 - 4pm 12/10/25</li>\n<li>G8 - 4pm 16/10/25</li>\n<li>G9 - 12noon 18/10/25</li>\n<li>G10 - 4pm 18/10/25</li>\n<li>G11 - 12noon 19/10/25</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
