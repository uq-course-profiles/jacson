You will review <strong>one </strong>of these children’s spaces according to <strong>key early childhood concepts highlighted in the course</strong>.</p>\n<p>You will consider the spaces from a child's perspective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What aspects of the space design appeal to young children? How are they motivated to engage in the space?</li>\n<li>What features would put them in direct conversation with the surrounding world?</li>\n<li>How does the space allow the potential for children's continual exchange with the personal, cultural and social context to construct meaningful experiences to attribute sense, knowledge building and integrated understanding?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This assessment consists of three parts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Review (up to 750 words):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Write a review</strong> of the <strong>one </strong>site that you focused on at either GOMA or State Library Queensland identifying evidence of application of the <strong>most</strong> <strong>pertinent</strong> key early childhood concepts highlighted in the course to the chosen space. Use the photographs and videos to <strong>explain the application of each concept</strong>. Support your review with references to <strong>course readings and wider literature</strong> on children’s spaces and early childhood education. Evaluate how the environment and the educators can attend to and engage children’s needs and interests, along with potential for constructing experiences which they are capable of attributing sense and meaning (Criteria 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Space Plan:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plan a learning space</strong> for an early years’ class to inspire wonder and facilitate co-constructed learning for <strong>one early years class group of children </strong>that engages <strong>personal, social and cultural</strong> experiences for a child. Use an online planning tool (such as floorplanner or roomsketcher). Label the design to highlight how you used ideas from the images and videos in your review to inform your own unique learning environment plan. (Criteria 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Space Rationale (up to 750 words)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Provide a rationale of your plan</strong> - annotate each key feature of your plan noting your rationale of the <strong>pedagogical intent </strong>and practice for that feature of the learning space (drawing from course content with links to references). A distinct purpose in your learning space between materials, opportunities, and young children must be evident. Clear practical evidence linking to the United Nations Sustainability Goals must be provided in your plan and annotations.</p>\n<p>You are required to integrate relevant references from the course readings and wider literature. Underneath your plan and annotations, describe and explain <strong>the educative purposes and goals</strong> and <strong>how you as a teacher could facilitate co-constructed learning</strong> with each element in the space you have designed. The plan will need to consider both interior and exterior space. Evidence of careful inclusion of design elements they provide interactive experiences in relation to the child and their surrounding reality. Evidence for careful inclusion of design elements to elicit a <strong>style of interactions in relation to the child and their surrounding reality </strong>is expected, even incorporating alternative educative approaches such as forest schools, needs in rural locations, inner city educational sites, or environments attached within workplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>All citations, referencing and formatting of the review and rationale are to be in APA 7th style.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There is no 10% leeway for the word count.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
