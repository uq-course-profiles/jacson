Postings must demonstrate that the task has been well thought through and completed. Postings must be reflective, insightful and succinct. Be mindful that students are required to read many contributions. Meaningfully comment on the posting of at least one student. Comments such as \"I agree with you that Amlodipine is a good choice for hypertension in this patient\" or \"Why did you choose amlodipine\" or \" well done, interesting case\" are okay to post but will not gain marks. In order to obtain marks you need to post meaningful comments e.g. \"I agree with you that Amlodipine is a good choice for hypertension in this patient, as the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend avoiding ACE Inhibitors in patients with this ethnicity\" or \"Why did you choose amlodipine?\" Even though this patient's ethnicity means they do not respond to an ACE Inhibitor, a betablocker may provide mortality benefit with his heart failure\". Contributions should provide a perspective that contributes to the learning of others.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Surveys / Quizzes / Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Provide answers to a series of questions. The correctness of answers will not be considered in the allocation of marks. However in order to obtain marks it must be clear that students have made a meaningful attempt at the questions with follow up to correct the questions answered incorrectly. A reasonable attempt is defined as achieving at least 70% of all answers correct on final attempt.  </p>\n<p><strong>(iii) Blue discussion boards and Tutorial presentation</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to contribute to the (Blue) Tutorial Discussion Boards for each module to prepare for the Tutorial. Each student will be assigned a group by the course coordinator.</p>\n<p>Groups will prepare the presentation for the online tutorial. The group presentation will be marked by the course coordinator. Marking criteria for this assessment is available in Learn.UQ (Blackboard).  A 16:9 PowerPoint format should be used. The recommended template is available to download in Learn.UQ (Blackboard). The online tutorials are scheduled for two hours on Thursday evenings from 7-9 pm Queensland time (check daylight saving for Southern states). These will be the day after the module activities are due. Each group member will be required to the post individual contributions on the blue discussion board and one member from each group will be required to upload their PowerPoint slides for the tutorial onto the blue discussion board for their group by the due date for module activities.</p>\n<p>See Learn.UQ (Blackboard) for further information and marking criteria.</p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
