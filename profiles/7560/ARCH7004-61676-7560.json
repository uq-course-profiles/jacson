With your group, you will visit, survey, analyse the assigned residential site and its urban context, understanding the potential of the existing facilities, services and infrastructure. You will work on the brief, functional diagram, master planning and massing study for the design of a multi residential building with common areas and services. By the end of this exercise, you are required to generate an innovative overall strategy – a design concept for residential units that can host a spread of familiar groups. Assignment 1 is a preliminary design proposal that will be progressed and finalised in Assignment 2. For Assignment 1, you work on a design concept seeking innovation in the way we live in the urban context. Four categories are to be observed and resolved in this social housing project following the further details provided in the course outline, which includes description of project deliverables. There is a buddy check component to this assignment.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group needs guidance, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI or MT to support learning:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Turnitin is accessed through the course Blackboard site. Turnitin also checks for plagiarism or instances where the original work of others is not appropriately acknowledged. Uploaded files must contain readable text and not be rasterised. Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission. To meet professional accreditation, public engagement and quality assurance obligations, digital copies of all course assessment items must be submitted in addition to any hard copy submission requirements specified in individual Course / Studio Outlines. Any physical models should be photographed and a minimum of two photographs describing the complete and full model must be included in the digital submission.  </p>",
