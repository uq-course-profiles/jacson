In what ways did convict women challenge and disrupt the systems that were intended to control them?</p>\n<p>2. Some convicts thrived in Australia. What was it about the penal colonies that made them places of opportunity for convicts, as well as places of punishment, at least until the 1820s?</p>\n<p>3. Why did colonists tend to have such negative perceptions of, and feelings towards, Indigenous Australians?</p>\n<p>4. Did the treatment of Aboriginal Australians in the period from 1788 to 1967 amount to attempted genocide? Discuss with reference to frontier violence and the Stolen Generations.</p>\n<p>5. In what ways did non-Indigenous Australians culturally connect themselves to the land in the late nineteenth century? What were the results?</p>\n<p>6. In what ways was the Anzac legend cemented into Australian culture in the period between 25 April 1915 and the outbreak of WWII?</p>\n<p>7. What happened to the children, families and communities of the Stolen Generations? How was the removal of Aboriginal children from their families justified by the government and white society?</p>\n<p>8. Was WWII a time of liberation for Australian women?</p>\n<p>9. In what ways did Australia use international diplomacy to try and improve its security in the decade after World War II?</p>\n<p>10. How successful were the \"liberationist\" campaigns of the 1960s and early 1970s? Discuss with reference to one form of liberation (feminism, gay rights, sexual liberation, Black Power etc)</p>\n<p>11. Paul Keating and John Howard were not just political opponents - they were quite contemptuous of each other as people. Why did each view the other with such contempt?</p>\n<p>12. Why do debates over Australian History arouse such passion?

What traditions does he draw upon? How does Hobbles Daniyeri describe the colonisation process? What traditions does he draw upon? In what ways does Clendinnen suggest that we use an appreciation of these different perspectives on contact to inform our understanding of Australian history more generally?

Sexual morality loosened, and the traditional and conservative views on sex lost a lot of their influence. These changes were, however, uneven for different groups of Australians, came in stages, and were often less than complete. One of the key features of this period was the uptake of the contraceptive pill, examined closely by Frank Bongiorno.</p>\n<p>What was so remarkable about the pill as a reproductive technology? What were its implications for different groups of Australians? What were the barriers to its adoption by women? What does Bongiorno see as its most significant effects? Was the widespread adoption of the pill a cause of the sexual revolution, or a symptom of it?</p>\n<p>For some groups, however, sexuality was restricted by far more than the fear of pregancny. In the second of the readings for this week, Graham Willett takes us into the early activism of the gay liberation movement, examining the period between the bold Gay Pride activities of 1973 and the first Mardi Gras of 1978.</p>\n<p>Was the pill at all connected to gay liberation? If so, how?

            "topic_description": "Sexual Liberation and its Limits Th 1960s and 1970s saw remarkable changes in public life, but also significant change in the most private of realms - the bedroom (or, given that these were more liberated times, the lounge, kitchen, backyard etc.). Sexual morality loosened, and the traditional and conservative views on sex lost a lot of their influence. These changes were, however, uneven for different groups of Australians, came in stages, and were often less than complete. One of the key features of this period was the uptake of the contraceptive pill, examined closely by Frank Bongiorno. What was so remarkable about the pill as a reproductive technology? What were its implications for different groups of Australians? What were the barriers to its adoption by women? What does Bongiorno see as its most significant effects? Was the widespread adoption of the pill a cause of the sexual revolution, or a symptom of it? For some groups, however, sexuality was restricted by far more than the fear of pregancny. In the second of the readings for this week, Graham Willett takes us into the early activism of the gay liberation movement, examining the period between the bold Gay Pride activities of 1973 and the first Mardi Gras of 1978.
