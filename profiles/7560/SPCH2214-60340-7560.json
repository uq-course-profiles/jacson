Students will analyse a narrative sample for microstructure (semantic content, syntactic structure and fluency), and macrostructure (story grammar and complexity). Parts of the analysis will be completed during class time under the direction of the tutor, with the expectation the remainder of the analysis will be completed by the students outside of class time. </p>\n<p>2. Students will write a summary report of the client's performance on the narrative task for the classroom teacher.</p>\n<p>Further information about this assessment item will be made available on the SPCH2214 Blackboard site.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
