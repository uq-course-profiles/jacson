Consider whether the seminars and readings introduced surprising or unfamiliar perspectives, or whether they deepened or complicated your existing understanding of environmental politics. You are encouraged to critically reflect on how issues were explored, rather than simply summarising content.</p>\n<p>You may wish to consider the practical and organizational challenges discussed in the course and how these complicate efforts to conceptualize, propose, and implement political responses to anthropogenic ecological problems. A productive approach to structuring your reflection is to identify key problems or tensions, formulate questions that arise from them, and sketch possible strategies or conceptual pathways for addressing these issues.</p>\n<p>Rather than offering a general summary of lectures or seminar discussions, concentrate on elements that resonated with you personally—ideas that challenged your thinking, raised unresolved questions, or opened up new directions for inquiry. Concluding your reflection with questions that remain open for you is a powerful way to demonstrate critical engagement and contribute to the 'learning-feedback loop' that this assignment is intended to foster.</p>\n<p>Producing a well-structured, thoughtful, and analytically rich reflection will not only support your academic performance but also serve as a valuable record of your intellectual development during the course. <strong>Where relevant, you should cite and reference sources appropriately, using a consistent academic style.</strong></p>\n<p>Since the word count range is already specified, no leeway of +/- 10% is allowed.</p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex.

It is clear and well-established that the dominant capitalist model of economic development and accumulation has accelerated and exacerbated many of the negative trends we currently face in environmental change and crisis. Today, we will examine those attempts to green global economic activities that operate from the premises of the current system and aim to include additional environmental safeguards and components. One of these attempts, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative, argues that valuing nature is key to protecting it.

It is clear and well-established that the dominant capitalist model of economic development and accumulation has accelerated and exacerbated many of the negative trends we currently face in environmental change and crisis.
