In this section you should argue the relevance of your curriculum design for the teaching situation and the needs of the learner group. The choices that you make in relation to goals, content, materials and assessment processes should be clearly justified in relation to research-informed theories of language teaching and learning. You should draw on course readings and current relevant literature to support your justification.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that your curriculum design project <strong>should not be based on an existing English language course book</strong>. APA referencing must be used.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
