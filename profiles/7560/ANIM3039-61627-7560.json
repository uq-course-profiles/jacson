Throughout the semester you will be working in groups with your peers. Each group will be assigned to work with Academic and be responsible for performing the designated rehabilitation tasks and maintaining clinical records of the treatments performed. For external students, this will be completed during the residential school.</p>\n<p>Activities will include applying rehabilitation techniques to condition Academic for upcoming breeding season and record-keeping of the progress on a dedicated Padlet Board, accessed on the course Blackboard site. The assessment will be assessed on your active participation in these activities.</p>\n<p><strong>The Report (10%)</strong></p>\n<p>You (as an individual) are to prepare and submit a report at the end of the semester that analyses the rehabilitation outcomes of Academic.</p>\n<p>The requirements for the report are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Outline the case: You should describe the horse (ID, breed, sex, age, etc.) and outline the history relating to the injury. Include a description of the activity for which the training regimen is developed; the frequency the activity is likely to be performed, other aspects of the horse’s performance that you consider appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Define the lameness (limb involved, type of lameness, grade of lameness)</p>\n<p>Discuss the techniques that could be used to make a definitive diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Outline the musculoskeletal structures involved in the lameness. Include any associated conformation issues that might have contributed to or resulted from the injury (if any)</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>Outline the rehabilitation plan.</p>\n<p>Present a record of your interventions over the week for which you are responsible for rehabilitating the horse.</p>\n<p>Evaluate the changes in the horse as reported via the Padlet board.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>Discuss the reasons for the interventions chosen.</p>\n<p>Describe how your training regimen effects the horse's body systems and relate this to the requirements of the horse’s activities.</p>\n<p>Present the positive and negative findings relating to the intervention. Discuss what you might do differently.</p>\n<p>Discuss the safety precautions necessary for the techniques used.</p>\n<p>Include references with a minimum of five (5) peer-reviewed journal articles.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Briefly restate the most important points of your report.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference list</strong></p>\n<p>Word limit – 2,000 words</p>\n<p><strong>The Demonstration of skills (10 %) </strong></p>\n<p>You will demonstrate the rehabilitation procedures you perform on the horse at the end of the semester (in person) or during the res school (external).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
