Students are expected to demonstrate a detailed understanding of each module, connecting theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Questions will require thoughtful analysis, integration of concepts across different contexts, and critical engagement with the material.</p>\n<p><strong>Independent Understanding</strong>: To pass this assessment, students must be able to discuss and defend their responses independently, showing a thorough grasp of the concepts and their applications without undue reliance on AI or other sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: The exam will last for 2 hours, providing ample time for students to articulate well-reasoned answers and showcase their understanding of the course content.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Review of all lecture notes, assigned readings, and case studies is essential. Participation in discussions and a deep understanding of the practical applications of concepts discussed in each module will be beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria</strong>: Responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy, analytical depth, relevance to the questions, and the ability to synthesize information from various course components. The quality of writing, clarity of argument, and appropriate referencing of sources are crucial.</p>\n<p>The exam will be an on-campus exam. Have your UQ student ID card available for all your exams.
