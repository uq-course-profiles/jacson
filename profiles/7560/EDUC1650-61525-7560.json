The activity should be engaging, interactive and based on a student-centred, constructivist approach to education. The activity can be 20-60 minutes in length. You do not need to design a whole lesson, just one activity. The one activity might have an introductory section, a middle part, and a conclusive section that might include a quick assessment to check for learning.</p>\n<p>The assignment has two parts:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Activity Plan</strong></p>\n<p>You will design an activity plan using a template provided to you on Blackboard. The activity plan will be approximately 500 – 600 words. You will need to provide a description of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The context for the activity, where and how it should be done, what subject area it is (Chemistry, Japanese, Business Studies etc)) and any other critical information that other teachers would need to know in advance of implementing the activity. You may reference the Australian Curriculum 8.4 or 9.0, or Queensland Syllabus documents. </li>\n<li>The intended learning outcomes of the activity - what do you think the secondary students will be able to do or understand at the end of the activity</li>\n<li>The resources required for the activity - laptops, URLs, apps, materials.....anything in terms of materials, technical or otherwise, and sources of information that you will need to do this activity with your students</li>\n<li>A description of what students will be doing - what will you ask the students to do at each phase of the activity, will they work alone or in groups/with partners, will there be opportunities to self-check on their progress, for example through peer or teacher interaction, or using apps and other generative AI tools, and so on. </li>\n<li>An outline of the support that the teacher will provide while students complete the activity - how you will help students do the activity, how you will introduce and guide the activity, and check on students' progress. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Design justification</strong></p>\n<p>The second part of the assignment involves you providing a justification for the design of your activity plan. This section will be approximately 1000 – 1200 words. In this section, you will need to cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A description of the learning and development theories that underpins your design (design: the decisions you took when developing the activity)</li>\n<li>A justification for why the development and learning theories were chosen - provide specific details of theory concepts, ideas and strategies and link them specifically with steps and phases in your activity</li>\n<li>An explanation of HOW you have drawn on the theories to inform the decisions you made in designing the activity - provide specific details of theory concepts, ideas and strategies </li>\n<li>The range of teaching strategies that will need to be employed during the activity</li>\n<li>A justification for the resources selected for use in the activity</li>\n<li>A reflection on what this task has helped you to understand about how learning and development theories inform practice</li>\n<li>Consider student diversity for all of the above (differentiation)</li>\n<li>A minimum of four references should be used to support your justification</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Australian Professional Standards for Teachers:</strong></p>\n<p>Focus</p>\n<p><em>1.2 Understand how students learn (Descriptor: </em>Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of research into how students learn and the implications for teaching)</p>\n<p><em>3.3 Use teaching strategies (Descriptor: </em>Include a range of teaching strategies)</p>\n<p><em>3.4 Select and use resources (Descriptor: </em>Demonstrate knowledge of a range of resources, including ICT, that engage students in their learning.)</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
