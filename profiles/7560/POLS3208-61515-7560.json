            "topic_description": "Lecture 5: Marxism and Critical Theory The lecture examines the various Marxist and neo-Marxist approaches. We begin with a brief overview of classical Marxists, such as Marx and Engels, focusing on how they bring imperialism and the economy into view. We then focus primarily on how more recent Marxist approaches theorise international politics. Here, we focus on the dependency theory and then examine the importance of the Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci, with a particular emphasis on his concept of hegemony and its relevance to international relations. The final part deals with neo-Marxists, or critical theory. Here we deal with theorists of the Frankfurt School, such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Jürgen Habermas. We examine the relevance of their work to international relations, contrasting, in particular, problem-solving and critical theories.",
