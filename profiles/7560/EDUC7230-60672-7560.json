You can either:</li>\n<li>Draw your Concept Map using pen and paper. When complete, you will take a photo; or</li>\n<li>Write your concepts on post-it notes and move these around on a table or board. Again, when complete, take a photo; or</li>\n<li>Complete an electronic concept map. In class, we will show you one program called MindMup <a href=\"https://www.mindmup.com/\">https://www.mindmup.com/</a> It is free to use. If you choose to use it, here are some tutorials to get you started: <a href=\"https://www.mindmup.com/tutorials/index.html\">https://www.mindmup.com/tutorials/index.html</a></li>\n<li>Conduct a broad literature search and review peer-reviewed research literature in relation to the meaning of “<em>student quality of life</em>”, for school-aged students. When you investigate this, you need to look at student quality of life broadly (beyond school) as well as their educational quality of life (at school).</li>\n<li>Conduct a second, more narrow literature search and review peer-reviewed research literature in relation to the <em>specific challenges</em> faced at school by one of the following group of students. You can, if desired, narrow this search to a particular age or year level, such as early childhood, primary or high school. You are then required to show how student quality of life can be strengthened (think about changes to systems, environments, practices). Your choice of student groups you can focus on include:</li>\n<li>Student with intellectual or cognitive disabilities</li>\n<li>Autistic students</li>\n<li>Students with a sensory disability impacting vision or hearing</li>\n<li>Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) students</li>\n<li>Students from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds</li>\n<li>Gifted and talented students</li>\n<li>Other students, by negotiation with the Course Co-ordinator</li>\n<li>You may present a broad concept map that explores quality of life across multiple domains, or a deeper concept map that examines quality of life across one targeted domain. Your decision will be guided by the literature you identify through your search. If you exceed the 1,000-word limit, you may need to narrow your focus.</li>\n<li>Present your findings as a concept map (see example below) showing how student quality of life can be strengthened your selected group of students by addressing the challenges they experience at school. We will discuss concept mapping at the Week 1 Lecture. The total word limit for your concept map should be 1000 words, with a margin of 1,100 words maximum.</li>\n<li>Copy and paste either your photo or an image of your electronic concept map into a Word Document.</li>\n<li>Below the image, provide a reference list using APA referencing style.

Setting up students and classrooms for academic and social success is a critical foundation for positive behaviour supports. Therefore, it is essential that teachers plan for positive, proactive, and instructional approaches to classroom management.</p>\n<p>Taking the role of the classroom teacher, <strong>you will develop a narrated PowerPoint presentation that discusses Tier 1 school-wide positive behaviour supports for the classroom</strong>. This presentation should demonstrate an understanding of the essential elements school-wide positive behaviour supports and include the <em>essential skills for classroom management</em> as well as <em>Tier 1</em> <em>classroom practices</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Within your presentation, please ensure that you cite the academic literature as this is an important aspect of this assessment task.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You will need to:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Complete a review of literature to learn more about Positive Behaviour Support and Tier 1 classroom practices, as well as the Essential Skills for Classroom Management.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Then, use your notes from the steps above to design a PowerPoint presentation and write a transcript for this presentation (2,000 words).</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Make a PowerPoint presentation outlining how you would implement Tier 1 school-wide positive behaviour supports in a classroom setting. This presentation must include:</strong></li>\n<li>Slide 1: A description of the class setting (year level etc.) and what might make this setting challenging for students.</li>\n<li>Slide 2: The strategies you will use to develop behavioural expectations, as how you would create a shared understanding of those behavioural expectations. Include at least one example of a positive behavioural expectation (what the expected behaviour looks like in measurable and observable terms).</li>\n<li>Slide 3: Tier 1 classroom practices you would use in your classroom.</li>\n<li>Slide 4: How you would use the Essential Skills for Classroom Management in your classroom.</li>\n<li>Slide 5: The strategies you will use to support the demonstration of the behavioural expectation(s) you have identified, by all members of the classroom.</li>\n<li>Slide 6: The strategies you will use to discourage behaviours that are inconsistent with the behavioural expectation(s) you have identified.</li>\n<li>Slide 7: How you would know whether these Tier 1 practices are being implemented with fidelity.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect on ways that you will make it clear that your PowerPoint Presentation has been informed by scholarly literature (You may, for example, want to ensure you have both in text references as well as a reference list at the end of your presentation).</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Check the criteria sheet again to ensure you have met all criteria.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Finally, record your narrated PowerPoint presentation.
