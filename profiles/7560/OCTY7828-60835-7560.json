During the sessional placement/simulation experience students will work as a team (in pairs or groups of 3 students) with a client to conduct information gathering/assessment and service provision. Refer to Learning Activities section 4.1 of the ECP for description of the components of this assessment item, <em>Sessional Placement: Adult Physical (Field Work)</em>. </p>\n<p>The main objectives of the sessional placement experience are for the student to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a supervised practical experience within a simulated clinical setting/clinical setting.</li>\n<li>Communicate with a client and staff (as appropriate) in a simulated clinical setting/clinical setting</li>\n<li>Conduct an initial interview, information gathering/assessment and/or service provision with a client in a simulated clinical setting/clinical setting.</li>\n<li>Write progress notes and a weekly treatment plan based on assessment or service provision conducted.</li>\n<li>Develop an understanding of the roles of the different members of the healthcare team within the hospital setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The assessment will be completed individually. To pass this assessment item students must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Participate in a (formative) simulation-based learning experience on UQ campus AND,</li>\n<li>participate in, and pass People Handling Competency Training and Assessment (pass/fail) - one-day on UQ campus. Refer to Learn.UQ for marking criteria AND,</li>\n<li>participate in one (formative) interprofessional simulation-based learning experience in either weeks 9, 10 or 11 AND,</li>\n<li>participate in, and pass on-site sessional placement (pass/fail) in a hospital rehabilitation setting on a Thursday morning for up to three weeks during the semester.

In terms of clinical placements, students are not permitted to use AI unless explicitly indicated by the provider that this use is permitted, and the parameters of use are clear. If these are not explicit, students are expected to consult with their practice educators before implementation to determine the acceptability of generative AI use and ensure that any potential risks associated with the intended use are addressed. AI is not a replacement of, or substitute for, professional reasoning or clinical skills. Human oversight is essential in its use, and to employ generative AI effectively and responsibly, students must understand how AI works, including its functions, data storage methods, and its impact on adherence to professional codes of conduct.</p>\n<p>If used on placement, students are responsible for any outputs generated by AI, such as clinical notes and reports, and will be held accountable for the actions of any AI that is used in clinical practice. This responsibility includes ensuring adherence to the relevant profession's code of conduct and ethical standards. Transparency about generative AI use is essential in placement environments. Students must follow the relevant policies and procedures of their placement provider. Students are reminded that they need to demonstrate their ability to meet the inherent requirements of the relevant profession, operate within its scope of practice, and ensure that client/patient privacy and confidentiality are maintained at all times. <strong>Under no circumstances should identifiable clinical information be uploaded to open or external AI platforms, as it is unethical and irresponsible.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
