(Some weeks may need to fit three students, depending on final numbers.) Presentations should be prepared such that without discussion they would go for around 20 minutes. However, the talk plus discussion will go for ~35 minutes, and the presenter should expect questions during their talk and ideally pose discussion points throughout their talk. Presenters are also expected to drive discussion after their talk, so should have some general talking points prepared. Each topic will have at specific articles or readings assigned to it. You can choose to speak broadly about your topic (present the general findings and themes in a number of the articles, and other articles not listed) or you can choose to go into more detail on one or two articles.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Criteria:</p>\n<p>Content/knowledge: 30%</p>\n<p>In order to scare the maximum amount of points allotted in this category, you will need to show that you understand the theory behind the studies/topic and descriptions and explanations should be accurate.</p>\n<p>Organisation/Clarity: 30%</p>\n<p>The presentation should be ordered logically, be easy to understand, define unusual terms, give examples, etc.</p>\n<p>Style: 20%</p>\n<p>Ideally, the presentation should be sound like you are explaining it naturally rather than reading or memorizing a prepared speech or simply reading the text on the slides. Points are awarded for an engaging delivery more so than polish, but overly slipshod presentation will lose marks as well. </p>\n<p>Discussion: 20%</p>\n<p>You will need to pose talking points and questions to encourage class discussion, whether that be during the talk or afterwards. The marks for this category are assigned based on the effort you make in generating and maintaining discussion. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

They will write a review of the paper in which they identify the assumptions on which it is based, its limitations (e.g. alternative explanations, suboptimal measurements), and what it adds to our understanding of the topic; they will then write a brief description of a hypothetical follow-up study to the reviewed paper.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Criteria:</p>\n<p>Content: 50%</p>\n<p>Marks from this category will be awarded for identifying and explaining the paper’s most important assumptions, limitations, and contributions to our understanding of the topic, and on the appropriateness of the follow-up study in addressing the flaws and extending on the contributions of the critiqued study.</p>\n<p>Organisation/Clarity: 25%</p>\n<p>In order for the content of your ideas to be understandable and persuasive to the reader, they need to be laid out in a coherent way and expressed in a clear and concise style. Logical, clear structure and grammatically correct and well-arranged sentences will earn marks in this category.</p>\n<p>Insight/creativity: 25%</p>\n<p>Critiquing a published paper is not straightforward – seeing its flaws or unique strengths requires a deep understanding of research methods and insight into how the critiqued paper compares with an ideal standard. Designing a follow-up study requires not only understanding the flaws of the study under review, but also creativity in being able to invent a new design/measures/procedure that would improve and extend the study.
