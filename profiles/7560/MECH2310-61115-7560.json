Each quiz is worth 2 marks in the total final marks.</p>\n<p>Each quiz contains one short answer question that is one of the applied class questions in the same week and two multiple-choice questions. The short answer question is worth 1 mark in the total final mark, and each multiple-choice question is worth 0.5 mark in the total final mark.  Each multiple-choice question has four possible answers, in which only one is correct. Thus, only one answer can be selected. </p>\n<p>Please refer to Blackboard for detailed marking criteria.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
