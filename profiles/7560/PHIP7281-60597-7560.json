Everyone is welcome to attend any or all of the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences seminars, and the school's research community (that includes you) are encouraged to attend. You may also attend research seminars in any other school or research institute at UQ and report upon those seminars. Suggested research institutes with seminars include the Translational Research Institute (TRI) and the Institute for Molecular Biosciences (IMB). Search for their research seminars online.</p>\n<p>Attending research seminars is not only an opportunity to find out what is currently happening in research, and appreciate the scope of research, but also to consider what you like or don’t like about how different researchers choose to orally/verbally present their work to their peers – i.e. their presentation style. For example, did you understand the material (i.e. could you very briefly sum it up in your own words)? Did the presenter refer to their slides? Did they engage and interact with you (the audience), e.g. did they maintain eye contact, or attempt interaction with you where appropriate? How did they try to maintain your interest throughout the presentation? </p>\n<p>Ultimately, reflecting on presentations by others can help you to consider how to improve your own oral presentations so that your audience finds it engaging and memorable.</p>\n<p>So, in this course, you will reflect on your experience of any TWO of the seminars presented during this semester. The 4 Rs of Reflection will be the approach used in this course. This approach was originally introduced in 2002 by Bain et al. as the 5 Rs for reflections on teaching and has been modified to fit this course (Bain JD, Ballantyne R, Mills C. and Lester NC. (2002). Reflecting on practice: Student teachers' perspectives. Post Pressed, Flaxton, Qld.).</p>\n<p>This assessment is NOT about reflecting on the content of the seminars you review. This assessment is about your experience of the seminar.</p>\n<p><strong>For TWO of the research seminars that you attend during the semester:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the oral presentation marking rubric as a guide to assess the seminar presenter</li>\n<li>Based on this, <strong>reflect on your experience of the presentation</strong> using the 4 Rs of reflection:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Reporting</li>\n<li>Responding</li>\n<li>Relating</li>\n<li>Reconstructing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your response for EACH seminar reflection should be written in 4 paragraphs. Paragraph 1 is \"reporting\", paragraph 2 \"responding\", paragraph 3 \"relating\" and paragraph 4 \"reconstructing\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The word limit for EACH reflection is 500 words. Only the first 500 words for EACH reflection will be marked.</li>\n<li>The average mark from the TWO reflections will be used towards your final grade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the course Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site for the 4 Rs of reflection, prompt questions to support your reflection, and the marking criteria. </p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
