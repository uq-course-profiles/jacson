Start as early in the semester as possible to search for a suitable cultural event for yourself. To accomplish this assessment, you are required to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attend and participate in one cultural event; this event should be organised by members of a culture (or subculture) other than your own (i.e. you are an \"outsider\" of this cultural or subcultural group). Examples of cultural events include, but not limited to, cultural fairs, weddings, church activities, cultural festivals and so forth. You may search the local newspapers, the internet, and any other sources to locate a suitable cultural event for you.</li>\n<li>Research for information (academic and non-academic) to learn about the culture or subculture you have chosen. Identify some aspects of the chosen culture you want to learn more about (e.g., a cultural practice, a tradition, a value, a traditional dish/food for special occasions, etc.). </li>\n<li>Observe and participate in the event. You may pay attention to how culture is reflected in the interactions and behaviours of people from the cultural group at the event. </li>\n<li>Formulate around 5 questions you want to ask people from this cultural group about the aspects of their culture you want to learn more about. Locate about three persons from this cultural group at the event to interview them with your questions to gather their views on what you want to learn more about their culture. Summarise your main findings.</li>\n<li>Identify a problem or a set of related problems that might arise in communication between members of your own cultural group and members of the cultural group under study (e.g., stereotypes, different beliefs and values, communication styles, etc.).</li>\n<li>Apply at least one theory to analyse the identified intercultural problem(s) and provide possible solutions. This requires you to apply your knowledge and skills learned in the course and other relevant literature you have searched. Your possible solutions should be specific, not just general statements. </li>\n<li>Reflect on your learning from this intercultural experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Include the following sections in your intercultural report</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Title of the report</strong>: Provide a specific title for your intercultural report.</li>\n<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: State the culture or subculture you have chosen and provide a justification for your choice of the cultural group and the event.</li>\n<li><strong>The event</strong>: Provide a brief description of the event and its significance to the cultural group who organised it.</li>\n<li><strong>Observations and interactions</strong>. Explain what you observed at the event that you understood accurately and what was puzzling to you. Describe your interview questions and the persons you have chosen to ask those questions (no need to include real names of the people you asked the questions). Summarise your main findings.</li>\n<li><strong>Problems, solutions and application of theories</strong>: Identify and analyse potential problems that might arise in communication between people from your own cultural group and the other cultural group under study. Provide possible, specific solutions to the identified intercultural problems by drawing on theories learned in the course and other relevant literature you have searched.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflection</strong>: Reflect on your experience of interacting with people from a different culture, and discuss what you have learned from your intercultural communication experience.</li>\n<li><strong>References: </strong>All sources of references cited within the report must be included in the reference list.
