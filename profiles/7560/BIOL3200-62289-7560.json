Make sure to confirm the project you want to undertake with the course coordinator (Prof. Brett Ferguson). Ideally you should have organised your project by the <strong>end of the first or second week </strong>of semester. Before commencing your project work, make sure to complete all appropriate Risk Assessments and training procedures (e.g. School, Local, Online inductions). Discuss this with your project supervisor.</p>\n<p>By the <strong>end of the fourth week</strong> of semester, you will be required to provide a project outline (1,250 – 2,000 words) with a Title page, brief background including literature review, aims and methods to be used, and references. Include a description of the steps you will undertake during the project. You may find that this changes as the semester progresses, but it is important to start with a plan. You also need to confirm that you have completed all Risk Assessments, inductions, and training procedures relevant to the project and describe any steps you need to take regarding safety. <strong>Discuss this with your project supervisor</strong> and let them see a draft of your plan well before the due date so you can get feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking: </strong>This will be marked out of 20: presentation (4 marks), brief background (4 marks), aims and methods to be used (4 marks), several relevant references written in a consistent style (3 marks). You should also include a timetable describing the steps you will undertake during the project (3 marks) and confirm the relevant inductions and Risk Assessments you were required to complete (2 marks).</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be acknowledged appropriately.
