This task expands your understanding of teaching outside your primary area of expertise and helps build a practical teaching resource for use in schools.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>Context and Expectations</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You will <strong>continue learning</strong> the same instrument from MUSC3840.</li>\n<li>Your playing and teaching focus should align with <strong>Curriculum Levels 3 and 4</strong> from the <strong>Education Queensland Instrumental Curriculum</strong>.</li>\n<li>You are expected to build an <strong>expanded portfolio</strong> covering instruments in your assigned group (Brass, Strings, or Keyboard).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>Portfolio Requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>Your portfolio will serve as a practical and pedagogical guide for teaching a family of instruments at the <strong>beginner school level</strong>. It must include the following:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Instrument Coverage – By Assigned Group</strong></h4>\n<p>You will create teaching resources and lesson materials for <strong>all instruments</strong> in your allocated group. These groups are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brass Group:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Trumpet</strong></li>\n<li>French Horn</li>\n<li>Low Brass (Trombone, Euphonium, Tuba)</li>\n<li><strong>Strings Group:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Violin</strong></li>\n<li>Viola</li>\n<li>Cello</li>\n<li>Double Bass</li>\n<li><strong>Keyboard Group:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Piano/Keyboard – with emphasis on both solo</strong> and <strong>accompaniment</strong> skills</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h4><strong>2. First Lesson Plans (Required for Each Instrument)</strong></h4>\n<p>For each instrument in your group, you must provide a <strong>\"First Lesson Outline\"</strong>, covering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instrument setup, posture, and handling</li>\n<li>Tone production basics (bowing, embouchure, fingering, etc.)</li>\n<li>Introduction to reading and playing using <em>Essential Elements for Band – Book 2</em> (or equivalent for strings/keyboard)</li>\n<li>Common first-lesson challenges and how to address them</li>\n<li>Realistic expectations and timelines for a beginner school student</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <em>You are responsible for writing your own outlines. These are the primary new materials being assessed.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>3. Annotated Resource Collection</strong></h4>\n<p>Include a selection of scholarly and practical resources such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Books, journal articles, and dictionary entries</li>\n<li>Technical exercises and method books</li>\n<li>Repertoire lists appropriate for first-year players</li>\n<li>Teaching websites or video content</li>\n<li>Lesson plans or classroom strategies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each resource, provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>brief summary</strong> of the content</li>\n<li>A <strong>discussion of how it can be used</strong> in instrumental teaching</li>\n<li>A <strong>classroom or studio application example</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h4><strong>4. Tutor Book Commentary</strong></h4>\n<p>Incorporate reflections based on class discussions where your tutor has demonstrated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What to focus on in first lessons</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Teaching challenges</strong> in each section of the book</li>\n<li><strong>Strategies for progress</strong> through the curriculum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use this commentary to support your understanding of <strong>effective beginner-level pedagogy</strong>.</p>\n<h3><br/></h3>\n<h3><strong>Practice Journal and Reflection</strong></h3>\n<p>Throughout the semester, maintain a <strong>practice log</strong> focused on your assigned instrument. At the end, submit a short <strong>reflection</strong> that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly progress and observations</li>\n<li>Effective or ineffective methods used</li>\n<li>Insights into how students might approach practice</li>\n<li>References to research on <strong>practice techniques and routines</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br/></h3>\n<h3><strong>Collaboration and Workload Guidance</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You are encouraged to <strong>collaborate</strong> with peers, especially on previously shared instruments (e.g., if you worked on Violin last semester, share with another student who did too)</li>\n<li>The only <strong>new work required</strong> from you individually:</li>\n<li>First lesson outlines for all instruments in your group</li>\n<li>Your written report</li>\n<li>Your personal practice reflection</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>Referencing Style</strong></h3>\n<p>All references must be <strong>correctly cited</strong>. The brief currently specifies <strong>APA style</strong>, however, the <strong>School of Music Academic Writing Guide</strong> recommends <strong>Chicago Style (Notes and Bibliography)</strong>. You are encouraged to clarify this with your course coordinator, but unless otherwise directed, it is advisable to follow the official <strong>UQ Music School Style Guide</strong>, which can be found here:</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://music.uq.edu.au/files/16914/music-academic-writing-guide.pdf\">UQ Music Academic Writing Guide (PDF)</a></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>Use of AI and Machine Translation</strong></h3>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Composition is viewed as the domain of advanced musicians. Yet, both skills may offer significant developmental benefits even to beginners.</p>\n<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>\n<p>Write an account that argues for the <strong>inclusion of improvisation and composition</strong> in the learning experiences of young musicians.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a clear rationale</li>\n<li>Suggest <strong>strategies and techniques</strong> for implementation</li>\n<li>Consider how teachers with <strong>limited confidence</strong> in these areas can still facilitate these experiences effectively</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br/></h3>\n<h3><strong>Topic Three: Aural Skills in Instrumental Teaching</strong></h3>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p>\n<p>Many educators lament the removal of aural requirements from the curriculum.

But what outcomes define <strong>good music teaching</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>\n<p>Develop a rationale for including <strong>non-instrumental activities</strong> in instrumental teaching.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluate how these activities contribute to:</li>\n<li>Technique</li>\n<li>Musicality</li>\n<li>Theory</li>\n<li>Aural skills</li>\n<li>Reading and context</li>\n<li>Creativity</li>\n<li>Consider whether the instrumental teacher’s role is to develop <strong>instrumentalists or musicians</strong></li>\n<li>Discuss how a <strong>balanced approach</strong> can be achieved</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br/></h3>\n<h3><strong>Topic Five: Motivation, Engagement, and Practice Discipline</strong></h3>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p>\n<p>While self-expression is important, self-discipline is often what determines success in music.
