Students are required to complete the pre-class reading and the associated workbook tasks and submit via the submission link on the course blackboard. This assessment item covers core themes and concepts discussed in the course and are designed to provide the foundations of topics we will explore in the online modules and then consider in an applied way in the workshops. In the workshops we will run feedback activities within groups aimed at giving students the opportunity to critically review their responses based on deeper consideration of the topics and through application of this knowledge. In line with this, students should also <em>bring a copy of their submission to the workshops</em> to assist with the critical review and feedback activities that will be run. Students are then strongly encouraged to revise their submissions based on clearer or deeper understandings that may arise from these discussions. Following workshops, students are strongly encouraged to edit and revise their workbooks. This revised work will then be compiled for the two final workbook compilations (see below). </p>\n<p>The workshops and workbooks are at the core of learning in this course. As such, <strong>workshops are compulsory</strong> - non-attendance at a workshop and/or non submission of a weekly workbook <strong>will incur a 5 mark penalty </strong>on the relevant final workbook compilation. </p>\n<p><strong>Workbook Compilation I:</strong> The first 2 responses, are to be submitted online as <strong>a single file</strong> to the course Blackboard site on the set date.
