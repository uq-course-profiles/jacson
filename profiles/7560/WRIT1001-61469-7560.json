The assessment is not considered submitted until both parts are received following the instructions below. </p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>PART A</strong></p>\n<p>Drawing on the knowledge you have gained from the WRIT1001 course content, you are to produce an argumentative essay as taught in the course. You are not to write your own essay on your own topic—you must improve the provided essay produced by generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT).</p>\n<p>The essay produced by a generative AI will be provided to you on the Monday of Week 13 (in the assessment folder).</p>\n<p>Part A of this assessment requires you to improve the AI-generated model essay, bringing its quality up to university standard with the skills you have learned in this course, including critical argumentation, logical structure, detailed research skills, appropriate and valid referencing of sources, etc.</p>\n<p>As the AI-generated essay will be short in length, you will be required to also increase the word count to approximately <strong>1200 words</strong>. The improved essay must follow <a href=\"https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format\">APA style paper format</a>, including a <strong>title page</strong> and a <strong>properly formatted reference list</strong> at the end. <strong>Note:</strong> The title page and reference list are <strong>not included</strong> in the word count.</p>\n<p><strong>This part of the task is worth 28 marks (out of 35).</strong></p>\n<p>----------------------</p>\n<p><strong>PART B</strong></p>\n<p>Submit a video reflection in which you explain the following:</p>\n<p>1/ How you used knowledge from the WRIT1001 course to revise and improve the Generative AI-produced essay, and</p>\n<p>2/ How you plan to apply this knowledge to your future academic writing tasks</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In your video, you <strong>MUST</strong> clearly explain the revision process step by step, describing how you improved the AI-generated essay. <strong>AND</strong> refer to specific WRIT1001 materials (e.g. workshops, UQExtend, or in-class activities) that helped guide your revisions.</p>\n<p><strong>This part of the task is worth 7 marks (out of 35). </strong>Students who fail to submit the video as per the instructions below will receive a mark of 0/35 on this assessment.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------- </p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>\n<p>Both PART A and PART B of this assessment must be submitted following these instructions in order to be considered “submitted” for marking.</p>\n<p>If either part of the assessment is not submitted <strong>BY THE DUE DATE</strong>, the assessment will accrue a penalty of 10% per day up to 7 days, after which it will receive a mark of 0/35</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>DETAILED UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>1. Submit a Word or PDF file of the argumentative essay to the <strong>Turnitin link </strong>on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>2. Upload video reflection on Blackboard. Instructions on how to do this are on Blackboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the START of the video, you must talk to the camera (i.e. NOT a photograph) and introduce yourself clearly showing your UQ ID card on FULL SCREEN. If you do not have a UQ ID card, please use a passport or a valid Australian driver’s license with your name in English. If the marker cannot see your ID clearly, your video will be considered not submitted.</li>\n<li>Presentations must be under 3 minutes - submissions that are significantly longer will have marks deducted.</li>\n<li>ALWAYS <strong>take a screenshot</strong> after the submission of your assessment. This is a way to ensure your submission is done successfully if there is a problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>----------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Your written assessment must be new work that you have not written this semester. Do not submit previously completed work.</strong></p>\n<p>Submitted work which is suspected to have used ghost-writing services will be investigated for academic misconduct and potentially face severe academic penalties.  </p>\n<p>You must clearly cite and acknowledge any instance of using AI or MT.</p>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/ai-tools-assignments#s-lg-box-22362889Acknowledgment\">Using AI in your assignments</a> on the UQ library site.</p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI &amp; MT Statement</strong>  </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
