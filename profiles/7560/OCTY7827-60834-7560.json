Successful completion of this assignment will enable the student to be eligible to pass the course with a maximum grade of 4 (if the remaining assessment in the course would result in a grade higher than 4, a maximum grade of 4 will be awarded).</li>\n<li>Students who fail the module, who do not complete either the reflective essay or the teamwork assignment above will be awarded a maximum grade of 3 (if the remaining assessment in the course would result in a grade higher than 3, a maximum grade of 3 will be awarded).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
