This task is designed to give you experience with workplace-relevant facilitation and communication skills including summarising, note-taking, and presentation.</p>\n<p>You will be allocated at least one seminar during the semester in which you (alongside your colleagues) will be responsible for taking notes (directly into a Google doc) and raising issues (both in the Google doc and verbally) for consideration by the class and the lecturer.</p>\n<p>To pass this item you need to contribute at least 4 written and 2 spoken contributions. These will be checked in class for legibility and substance.</p>\n<p>This item is a hurdle assessment. If you pass this assessment item, you will receive a full 20 marks. If you fail the item, you will automatically receive an overall grade of 3 for the course. Students who receive an overall score of 3 in the Course are eligible to apply for a supplementary assessment (my.uq <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/supplementary-assessment\">Supplementary Assessment</a>)</p>\n<p>If a medical or other circumstance means you are unable to participate for your allocated seminar/s, you may be rescheduled for an alternative seminar/s. Please contact the course coordinator directly <em>before </em>the date of the allocated seminar/s you are unable to attend. If the permission is granted, the course coordinator (or assistant) will liaise with you about rescheduling.</p>\n<p>In preparation for your allocated seminar, you should familiarise yourself with your role (these will be discussed in week one) and carefully read the required reading.</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.

You should identify a country, or region of a country to nominate your case.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Prepare a 5-minute video self-recording introducing the peacebuilding case that you will focus on during the course. Your video should specify the:</p>\n<p>o  Country or geographical region that you have chosen</p>\n<p>o  Main actors or parties to the conflict</p>\n<p>o  Core sources or causes of the conflict</p>\n<p>o  Key challenges for peacebuilding</p>\n<p>o  Possible focus that you may take for the Case Analysis assessment item, with an explanation about why this is important – either to the conflict case or for other reasons you wish to present. (Foci may include – but should not be limited to! - the security-development nexus, gender, coloniality/ethnicization, Indigenous peoples, gender, young people, transitional justice, DDR, memorialisation etc. You should choose a single focus.)</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

(It is common for people to believe that they can simply ‘talk’ without having a plan, but this rarely works well.)</p>\n<p>o  It is not necessary to script your presentation. Please do not aim for perfection. It can be tempting to try re-recording to eliminate errors, but it is natural that your video recording has some minor errors in it (you do not need to produce a newsreader or studio quality video).</p>\n<p>o  10% above or below the length limit is fine.</p>\n<p>o  If you need to refer to sources in your video, please give enough key information for the viewer to be able to search for and find the source. E.g., for an academic article, the author, year, and name of the journal.</p>\n<p>o Begin your video by saying “Hello, my name is …. and this is my case description video’. </p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Your proposal may target, for example, a national or regional policy maker, a United Nations agency, a religious body/bodies, Indigenous peace actors, a local community, or other actors/conflict parties of your choice – even insurgents.</p>\n<p>Please make clear your choice of target audience (the recipient for your proposal) on your title page and in your introduction.</p>\n<p>The introduction to your proposal should briefly summarise your peacebuilding case, the analysis conducted in the previous analysis report, and explain how you structure the remainder of your proposal report. The body of your report should draw upon relevant academic, professional and grey literature. It should:</p>\n<p>o  Develop your proposal in response to conflict dynamics or challenges.</p>\n<p>o  Clearly explain your proposal both in broad terms (what is the type of assistance/intervention proposed) and in the details (who should be involved, how will it bring about changes in dynamics).</p>\n<p>o  Identify the challenges and limitations of your proposal. </p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
