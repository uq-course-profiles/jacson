You will complete seven weekly reflective responses based on your engagement with the required readings.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>You must engage with at least one of the required readings for the week before writing your reflective response. Your response should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the week's content and how it connects to your understanding of educational innovation and change.</p>\n<p><strong>Guiding Questions (Optional)</strong></p>\n<p>These questions are provided to help guide your thinking, but you are free to explore other themes that emerge from your reading and reflection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are my beliefs about innovation in education? Can innovation affect education? If so, how?</li>\n<li>Can you see a connection between ICT, leadership, and teaching practice? If so, what is it?</li>\n<li>Why should/shouldn't education professionals learn about ICT and leadership?</li>\n<li>How do this week's readings challenge or confirm my existing beliefs about educational change?</li>\n<li>What themes or ideas from the readings resonate most strongly with me, and why?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Writing Approach</strong></p>\n<p>This is a personal reflective piece - express your own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs informed by your engagement with the readings. You are encouraged to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Draw connections between the readings and your personal experiences</li>\n<li>Explore themes that emerge from your reading, even if they differ from the guiding questions</li>\n<li>Use language that feels natural to you (academic or colloquial)</li>\n<li>Structure your response in whatever way makes sense (essay format, subheadings, etc.)</li>\n<li>Include questions that emerge during your reflection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No additional research or references are required - focus on your own reflections informed by the weekly required readings.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Schedule</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission weeks: Weeks 1-6 and Week 8 (7 submissions total)</li>\n<li>Week 7: No submission required</li>\n<li>Submission window: Monday 10:00 AM (after class) to Monday 8:00 AM (before next class)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grading System</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total possible points: 7 (one point per weekly submission)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an in-class assessment - extensions cannot be requested through Unitask</li>\n<li>You must engage with at least one required reading to demonstrate understanding of the week's content</li>\n<li>The teaching team expects your best reflective work while recognizing this as a personal, opinion-based task</li>\n<li>Your sustained, disciplined reflection converted into words is what earns your pass - there is no predetermined standard of \"adequate\" reflection</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>\n<p><em>Do I get a point by simply submitting</em>?</p>\n<p>Yes, provided you demonstrate genuine engagement with at least one required reading and thoughtful reflection. Your responses will be read, and we expect authentic engagement with the course content.</p>\n<p><em>Do I need to follow the guiding questions exactly</em>?</p>\n<p>No. The guiding questions are there to help you get started, but you can explore any themes that emerge from your reading and reflection about educational innovation and change.</p>\n<p><em>Do I need to write in academic English</em>?</p>\n<p>Not necessarily. Since this is personal reflection, use whatever language style feels most authentic to you.</p>\n<p><em>How do I show I've engaged with the readings</em>?</p>\n<p>You don't need to cite or quote extensively, but your reflection should clearly demonstrate that you've read and thought about at least one of the required readings for that week.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Your PD byte will be a succinct, accessible, targeted and practical professional development experience that deploys learning design principles appropriate to an asynchronous context to support your colleagues to understand how to use ICT to expand curriculum learning opportunities for students in a specific learning area of the Australian Curriculum.</p>\n<p>Your PD byte presentation can be delivered in any format such as a slideshow in PowerPoint or Prezi, or you can even try less common applications for presentations such as Padlet. Whichever software or application you decide to use, your PD Byte presentation must include 20 minutes of original narration recorded by the group (roughly 5 minutes per person in a group of 4).</p>\n<p>The video presentation should also contain a QR code that will provide access to the annotated bibliography and resources so that your fellow preservice teachers can engage with them.</p>\n<p>Your PD byte should also:</p>\n<p>• Clearly identify the learning area and specific learning outcomes you are targeting (the APST may help inform your learning outcomes)</p>\n<p>• Equip your colleagues with one or two strategies for using an ICT tool to expand curriculum learning opportunities for school students in relation to the learning area and learning outcomes you have identified</p>\n<p>• Demonstrate your capacity to design learning to achieve the learning objectives of your PD session using a range of strategies and activities that engage your colleagues in learning (e.g., brief activity, pause to think, discuss with a partner, respond to a quiz or poll, post to Padlet etc.)</p>\n<p>• Critically evaluate how ICT can be used safely, responsibly, and ethically in the context of your seminar focus</p>\n<p>Your PD Byte must be accompanied by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an annotated bibliography detailing (i) eight appropriate sources of professional learning (scholarly or reputable professional books or articles) related to your seminar focus that will help teachers to further develop their practice <strong>and</strong> (ii) two teaching resources (10 items in total). Your annotated bibliography and resources will be made available to your fellow preservice teachers via a QR code that will be displayed during your presentation.</li>\n<li>A task planner or work log (in a graph or table) for planning and progress monitoring for the entire group. The planner should detail the contributions made by each group member, which should be equally shared (see ‘Important information about group work’ below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Submission Note:</strong></p>\n<p>Your group must carefully follow submission instructions (below) to ensure accessibility for both engagement and marking:</p>\n<p>Submit one Word document via Blackboard containing</p>\n<p>a) The link for the recorded presentation with narration;</p>\n<p>b) the annotated bibliography &amp; resources;</p>\n<p>c) the task planner/work log Submit this document via the Blackboard link AT2 under the assessment menu.</p>\n<p>Use the Padlet link below to share your PD Byte recording with all course participants. <a href=\"https://padletuq.padlet.org/m_ocriciano2/educ7604-pd-byte2025-akr8zohtfruhmzb2\">https://padletuq.padlet.org/m_ocriciano2/educ7604-pd-byte2025-akr8zohtfruhmzb2</a></p>\n<p>In the Padlet link, after watching the PD Byte, use the star system to rate the session and also leave a comment. Each student should leave a comment in 4 different PD Bytes (minimum). Whatever comment you decide to leave, just remember to always be respectful. </p>\n<p><strong>Important information about group work</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You will receive a single group mark for this task, as all group members should contribute equally to the design and delivery of the PD session. However, exceptions can be made in the event of one or more group members engaging in ‘social loafing’ (also known as ‘free riding’):</strong></p>\n<p><em>Free riding is a form of social loafing seen in a group when one or more members slacks off and ‘rides’ on the extra efforts of their co-workers (Walker &amp; Angelo, 1998).</em></p>\n<p><strong>If your small group is experiencing dysfunction, including ‘social loafing’ by one or more members, it is your responsibility to bring this promptly to the attention of your tutor / course coordinator, who will then support the group to resolve the problems in a respectful way. If no resolution can be found, the tutor / course coordinator can take steps including:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removal of the non-contributing student/s from the group and require student/s to complete the task either individually or in another small group with other ‘social loafers’</li>\n<li>Deducting one grade from the overall group score for non-contributing student/s, as evidenced in the task planner or work log (see criteria sheet).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>APST Assessed: 2.6, 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, 6.2</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In the context of this task, the term ‘program’ means an identifiable and distinct ‘packaged’ approach that claims to support or enhance student learning – it does not necessarily have to involve ICT. It could, for example, be a reading program (e.g., Reading to Learn); numeracy program (e.g., Cognitively Guided Instruction); technology program (e.g., P-TECH); music program (e.g., Kodály music education); multi-subject program (e.g., STEM/STEAM); and so on.</p>\n<p>You might have encountered this program during your professional experience placement, or you might want to identify a program through academic or professional literature. Either way, it is recommended that you choose a program that is either (i) directly related to one of your teaching areas, or (ii) aligned with one of the General Capabilities, such as Literacy, Numeracy, or Critical and Creative Thinking. Above all, choose a program that you believe will be useful to you in the future.</p>\n<p>To evaluate the program, you should explore and synthesise relevant scholarly literature to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the program’s purported relationship with student learning</li>\n<li>Examine its strengths and weaknesses</li>\n<li>Explore implications for teachers and learners</li>\n<li>Provide recommendations to adapt/modify/change the program for the purpose of improving student learning</li>\n<li>Demonstrate knowledge of strategies that can be used by teachers to evaluate teaching programs to improve student learning</li>\n<li>Use APA7 formatting and referencing conventions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Quick Tips</strong></p>\n<p>Choose something you are interested in learning about that you believe you can justify counts as a \"teaching program\" based on your interpretation of the description in the criteria.</p>\n<p>In case you have some concerns about whether the teaching program truly fits, the teaching team recommends you add a comment to explain or justify why you think what you chose counts as a teaching program, addressing potential concerns for fit (if you think there are any), referring to the relevant influences on your opinion, and ultimately convincing yourself (and the teaching team) that your choice is appropriate enough for this assessment. </p>\n<p>Your efforts in explaining a potential issue with your program choice will help the person marking your paper understand your perspective. We will try to grant you the benefit of the doubt unless we strenuously disagree (e.g. you chose a search engine, a general repository such as Pinterest or Wikipedia, a management-focused ICT tool unrelated to your content, or other inappropriate choices).</p>\n<p>You will still approach it as evaluating a program, you can still show your program evaluation skills, so even if we do disagree at some level, you have the opportunity to address the criteria. Adding further reflections as suggested above will likely help you reinforce (to yourself and the person marking your paper) that you chose something sufficiently appropriate for this context.</p>\n<p>APST Assessed: 3.6</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
