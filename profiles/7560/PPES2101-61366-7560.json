Please relate your analysis to the conceptual literature on problem/policy framing [such as Carol Bacchi (2009) or BG Peters article (2005)].</p>\n<p><strong>Remember: this is not an exercise in 'solving' the problem - it is an exercise in delineating how a problem has been characterised, and whether these interpretations reveal a narrow or comprehensive understanding of the problem.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine that there has been a policy debate about whether ONLINE BETTING is a problem and whether it therefore should be tolerated, encouraged, regulated or banned.</p>\n<p>Your task would be to 'unpack' how a government policy assumes a particular view of the problem; or how different groups might interpret the policy problem from different perspectives.</p>\n<p>Some might regard all betting as morally offensive and as exploitation of vulnerable people. Others might regard betting as a personal choice and consistent with personal freedom and responsibility, and thus not a 'problem' requiring regulation. Some might regard the advertising of betting opportunities as inappropriate for children. Others might argue that online betting is deeply problematic because it is controlled by international corporations. These (and other) positions tend to be linked to different attitudes towards this powerful and growing industry. Some may want to ban specific forms of betting and advertising; others may want to protect children; some may focus on protecting gambling addicts and vulnerable families. Others might take a 'laissez-faire' attitude and regard it as a normal investment opportunity in a market society or as a harmless recreation activity. </p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed individually by each student. Clarification of the task, including relevant literature and suitable policy examples, will be conducted in-class.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.
