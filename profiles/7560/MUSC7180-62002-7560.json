The process will be taught to you during the lecture in week two, and from this, you are tasked with creating lyrics formed through poetic inquiry. You are encouraged, though not required, to develop your lyrics into a song (the recording of which should be uploaded to soundcloud, and linked on your TurnItIn submission). Your submission must include the transcript from engaging in the process, with highlights indicating preferred phrases that led to the creation of your lyrics. Your lyrics should also have any verbatim text from your transcript highlighted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong>: Write a reflective essay on your experiences with music education, informed and supported by critical evaluation of (4-6 pieces at least) of literature (from the last three years, published in peer-reviewed journals). This task requires you to critically evaluate your own experiences of music learning and teaching and to consider the ways in which the experiences of others may differ from yours. The task asks you to critically evaluate readings in the area, in light of your own experiences.</p>\n<p>In your written reflection, you are asked to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reflect critically on readings from a personal point of view. Discuss the ways in which the experiences of music learning and teaching described in the readings affirms or challenges your own experiences of music education as a student and as a teacher. How is this reflected in your transcript, and in your lyrics? Provide specific examples.</li>\n<li>Reflect critically on the papers as a professional educator. Discuss the significance of these readings for you as a music educator (in school, studio, community settings). How do these readings challenge, change or strengthen your current practice?</li>\n<li>Support your reflections using scholarly referencing in APA7 style. Your chosen literature might include articles on academic or arts-based reflection, professional identity, music teacher or musician identity, and reflexivity</li>\n<li>Use first person tense.</li>\n<li>Include: an introduction, body of the essay, and conclusion. Include a well-crafted and formatted reference list in APA7. Do not number the sections, however you may use headers.</li>\n<li> Use 10-12 point Times New Roman font; double space your lines, indent the first line of each new paragraph.

In searching for literature on this topic, <strong>you can only use articles published in the last three years.</strong> Your review must include a minimum of 8 articles and a maximum of 11. Articles must report research studies in music education (including systematic literature reviews), be sourced from reputable scholarly journals and be peer-reviewed. Articles must be relevant to the topic. You are encouraged to investigate more broadly than dedicated music education journals, but note the articles must reflect current music education research.</p>\n<p>Please present your submission in 2 parts within a single document:</p>\n<p>1. Annotated Bibliography (2200 words maximum)</p>\n<p>This is an alphabetised reference list with details of the articles you are critiquing. In the list you will include the following: Journal article citation (using APA7), followed by a 200-word annotation. Include in the annotation: Research Aims and Question/s; Research Method/s; Data Analysis, and Findings. Each annotation must provide a summary and a critical evaluation of the research. Do not reproduce the abstract.</p>\n<p>The annotation for each article should be 200 words. For the minimum requirement of 8 articles, a 200-word annotation makes a minimum word count for this component of the assessment 1600 words. The citation is not included in the word count. Provide a word count at the end of the bibliography.</p>\n<p>2. Critical literature review (1500 word maximum)</p>\n<p>A literature review is a type of academic writing that provides an overview of existing knowledge in a particular field of research. In this essay, provide a critical review of the 8-11 articles you sourced in the annotated bibliography. The review must firstly provide an outline of the topic you are investigating, followed by a critical analysis of the research findings in the selected literature. In your review you should: identify patterns of trends in the research reviewed, note any new knowledge in relation to the topic, identify any gaps or limitations in the research, and discuss the implications of the research findings for music educators. A good literature review summarises, analyses, evaluates and synthesises the relevant literature within a particular field.</p>\n<p>Present your essay in 12-point Times New Roman font (or other similar font), with double-spaced lines, paragraphs aligned to the left. Include the word count after each section. Include headers for each section, and include page numbers.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Other information</strong></p>\n<p>Follow appropriate formatting guidelines for APA7, including using 12-point Times New Roman font (or other similar font) in black, and double-space your lines. Use a hanging indent for your reference list ( which should be in alphabetical order) and justify the lines to the left.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
