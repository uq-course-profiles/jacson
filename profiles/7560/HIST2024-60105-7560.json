Your essay should be based on original reading and research in the relevant historical literature to your topic, with <strong>at least 12 items in your bibliography.</strong> While most of these will be secondary sources, you must use <strong>at least 3 primary sources</strong> as well. As this is an essay assessment, your examination of the topic should have all the elements of an essay including an introduction, conclusion, and thesis statement. This essay is to be completed with footnotes and a bibliography according to essay conventions, and uploaded to Turnitin by the due date. Be sure to <strong>double-space</strong>, and include a <strong>title</strong>.</p>\n<p>1.   Choose a major historical figure and consider their role in shaping a specific revolution.</p>\n<p>2.   Choose a major historical text and consider the way in which it informed or inspired a specific revolution.</p>\n<p>3.   Write a historiographical research essay on a particular revolution. What are the key issues of debate that motivate historians in relation to that revolution? </p>\n<p>4.   Make a case for or against Thomas Kuhn’s model for understanding scientific revolutions by examining one of the Copernican, Newtonian, Chemical, Darwinian, or Einsteinian Revolutions.</p>\n<p>5.   Assess the global impact of a specific revolution. How does understanding the revolution’s global dimension alter its traditional historiographical meaning?</p>\n<p>6.  Develop a question of your own about a specific revolution but ONLY after consultation with the course co-ordinator and ONLY with their approval.</p>\n<p><strong>Referencing style:</strong> Students must use Chicago style for references (footnotes) and bibliographies: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html</p>\n<p><strong>Word Limits:</strong> A word count that is within ±10% of the set length (1,000 words) is acceptable. Word count does not include bibliography or footnotes; however, discursive footnotes are included in the word count. A word count that is outside these 10% will receive a proportionate penalty and will be graded against the grading criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>AI: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
