Note these are like mini creative writing vivas except they’re not verbal.</em></p>\n<p>From Week 2 to Week 11, there will be a written quiz held in the lecture (8 in total). During the lecture, you will be given 15 minutes to answer 2-3 questions.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>8</strong> opportunities to take the quiz, each of which are worth 6%, but you only need to do it<strong> 5 </strong>times, forming 30% of your grade.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that there are </em><strong>NO</strong> <em>opportunities to re-take individual quizzes and no alternative assessment available except in the very specific circumstances. </em></p>\n<p>As this is in internal course, a student must make themself available to undertake their quizzes at the scheduled date, time, and venue. Please see <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=203\">Exam Procedures</a> for full information. </p>\n<p>These are handwritten, closed book quizzes which means that no written material, electronic material or electronic devices can be used. All such items should remain in your bag or under your desk. All electronic items must be switched off or in airplane mode. Where a devise emits any noise, the student may be subject to allegations of misconduct and the items may be confiscated for the duration of the quiz. You will be permitted to bring suitable writing implements (in a clear container), water in a clear bottle with the label removed, disposable ear plugs. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a Disability Action Plan that applies to the quiz (and you’ve not received a reply following submission of the action plan), please contact me immediately. We can make accommodations in the lecture for many of the issues documented in Disability Action Plans (e.g., if you cannot handwrite exams).</p>\n<p>If a student has a genuine (documented) reason they have been unable to attend the lecture <strong>on 3 occasions</strong>, a make-up test will be offered later in the semester, using different questions. There is already flexibility built into this assessment to miss up to three quizzes, so the make-up quiz does not apply to students who miss less than three lectures for illness, etc. The make-up quiz is <em>only </em>available to students who have a genuine, documented reason for missing more than three lectures. Reasons may include: sudden/serious illness that requires a lengthy absence; or another documented reason for a lengthy absence. Reasons are documented in the ECP. Please refer here.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for alternative assessment, you must contact me by Week 5 with your documentation. If there is an unforeseeable change to your circumstances (eg illness, new job) after that date, please contact me as soon as you can with documentation.</p>\n<p>There will be <em>one</em> make up test session offered in which you'll complete 5 different quizzes over a period of 80 minutes. It will take place in the week 13 lecture slot so please ensure you're available. You will be given a selection of quiz questions, but you only have to answer 5 of them. They will not be the same quiz questions as those used in the original quizzes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
