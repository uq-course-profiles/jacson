Following the presentation of their video, each group will facilitate a 10-minute activity to support student learning. Following the tutorial activity, students will be marked on their responses to questions posed by students and/or tutors.</p>\n<p>In videos, groups should demonstrate:</p>\n<p>·        their applied and critical understanding of the theory and concepts;</p>\n<p>·        the sociological/anthropological relevance and origins of the concepts;</p>\n<p>·        how the theory and concepts help us to understand the social determinants of health (in terms of class, gender, race and ethnicity).</p>\n<p>Videos should be thoughtful, engaging and original (not merely what is presented in lectures). Said another way, they should not copy and paste content from the lecture; they should be original showing application beyond the examples provided in the course materials.</p>\n<p>To create the 5-minute videos, students can use whatever platform they are comfortable with. Adobe Premiere Rush is one platform available to UQ staff and students, sufficiently sophisticated, and relatively user friendly. This and others will be presented to students in a section 1 lecture (follow this link for details on video editing platforms/training available at UQ: <a href=\"https://uq.pressbooks.pub/digital-essentials-choose-the-right-tool/chapter/image-video-and-audio-tools/#video\">https://uq.pressbooks.pub/digital-essentials-choose-the-right-tool/chapter/image-video-and-audio-tools/#video</a>).</p>\n<p>In tutorial activities, students will be assessed on the quality of engagement fostered. These activities are up to you, but might include a case study reflection, interactive quiz or group media analysis task. The question-and-answer component allows for individual assessment of applied understanding. Student-led tutorial activities and the Q&amp;A component will be recorded on the day, allowing the tutor to review the recording prior to finalising their mark and feedback. The recordings will be uploaded to a secure share folder for the course that will be deleted after 12 months.</p>\n<p>One member of the group will be required to submit their video on behalf of the team through Blackboard by 2pm on 26 August. <strong>The first slide or equivalent of the video should outline the roles performed by / contributions of each member of the group. </strong>For instructions on how to submit a video assignment, please visit: <a href=\"https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-ultra/video-assessment-ultra/submit-video-assignment-echovideo-ultra-student\">https://elearning.uq.edu.au/student-guides-ultra/video-assessment-ultra/submit-video-assignment-echovideo-ultra-student</a>.</p>\n<p>Peer- &amp; Self-Assessment through ‘Buddy check’: before (week 4) and following submission, students will be asked to complete a peer and self-assessment using the Buddy Check platform (link will be available through the assessments folder on Blackboard) that will be used to pro-rate a portion of the marks for this group assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course (and in the course guide). </p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task (e.g., supporting the visualisation of the theory/concepts). Students may appropriately use AI in developing their videos, but not to support their response to questions in the Q&amp;A portion of the assignment. Students must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.
