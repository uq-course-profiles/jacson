Correct placement in JAPN1011 is a hurdle requirement for this course.

The use of these tools is not in your best interest. If the work you submit does not reflect your actual language ability, you may be placed in a course that is not appropriate for your level, which could negatively affect your learning and performance. This may also be considered an act of student misconduct under the UQ Student Code of Conduct due to the misrepresentation of your capabilities.</p>\n<p>This requirement aims to ensure that you are placed in the most appropriate language course based on your current level of linguistic proficiency. Please note that all language courses include at least one assessment task where the use of generative AI or MT tools is either not allowed or of limited value. These assessments are designed to be authentic, challenging, and based on real-time interaction. You will be expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of your own work without the assistance of AI or MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
