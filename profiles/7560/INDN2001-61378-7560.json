It is especially concerned with reinforcing and developing your listening and speaking skills and your understanding of pluralism in Indonesia as it relates to language use. This assessment is designed to give you a tool that you can use in unfamiliar contexts (often referred to as learn-how-to-learn tools). In this case, the tool is interviewing. At the same time, this assessment is also designed to encourage you to form positive social relationships with Indonesian students who are studying on campus.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Interview an Indonesian friend or acquaintance in Indonesian to find out how they say “I” and “you” within their family, friendship, and work circle. The interview should take you no longer than ten minutes to complete and then around a further two hours to transcribe. Ensure that you transcribe everything that is said including false starts, mispronunciations, and so on. There is no word length limit on your transcript and the length will depend on how succinct and understandable your questions are and how long your interviewee's responses are. More specifically, in your interview you will need to find out how they say “I” and “you” in their interactions with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brothers</li>\n<li>Sisters</li>\n<li>Father</li>\n<li>Mother</li>\n<li>Uncles</li>\n<li>Aunts</li>\n<li>Cousins</li>\n<li>Grandfather</li>\n<li>Grandmother</li>\n<li>Friends</li>\n<li>Girlfriend/boyfriend/partner/significant other</li>\n<li>Work colleagues</li>\n<li>Work superiors (e.g., supervisors, boss)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are seven steps you need to follow to complete this field report:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Familiarise yourself with the assessment rubric for this piece of assessment. Ask questions about what you are unsure of in the last ten minutes of class.</li>\n<li>Start to think about how you will go about finding an Indonesian to interview in Indonesian. Remember to let them know: a) why you want to interview them (i.e. to get to know an Indonesian and to practice your Indonesian); b) what you will do with the recording (i.e. transcribe it an present it as an assignment to your lecturer); and c) how you will store the recording and transcript securely and not let anyone except you, them, and your lecturer have access to it.</li>\n<li>Download a voice recording app to your mobile phone or ensure that you have one installed. Learn how to use it, e.g., can the recording be slowed down to help you listen to it.</li>\n<li>Do the interview and record it. Store your recording securely so that only you can access it and remember that you cannot share this recording with anyone else except me.</li>\n<li>Familiarise yourself with Table 3 from pages xvii-xviii of the Kamus Indonesia-Inggris (third edition) by John Echols and Hassan Shadily published in 1992 by PT Gramedia in Jakarta. There is a copy of this located in the resources folder in the Learn UQ site for this assignment.</li>\n<li>Listen to the recording of your interview and in a tabular format represent what you hear as accurately as you can, and in a way that closely matches the orthographic conventions described in the Kamus Indonesia-Inggris dictionary noted in step 5.</li>\n<li>Once you have finished, arrange another time to meet with the Indonesian you interviewed to collaboratively go over your transcript to check the accuracy of it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rubric provides specific details on how this presentation will be assessed.
