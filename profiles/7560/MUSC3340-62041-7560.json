Musical development and learning. Certain music capacities are innate. Other music capacities develop through an individual's interactions with their physical, social, and cultural worlds and as a result of effortful learning. Review recent and pertinent literature examining an aspect of individual musical development or learning within a specific stage of life (e.g. early childhood, adolescence, 3rd age, etc.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. Music perception. There are some fundamental ways in which humans perceive music-related sensory information (e.g. auditory, visual information). Review pertinent and recent research examining human perception relevant to music (e.g. perception of frequency as musical sound, musical perceptual illusions).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Cognitive processing of music. Listening to, or actively making music activates a range of cognitive processes and neural representations. Review pertinent and recent literature that examines cognitive processing in relation to music (e.g. music and memory, involuntary musical imagery, music and individual or synchronised action, processing musical structures - compositional form, rhythm, pitch).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. Music and emotion. Music has the power to express and induce emotions. Review pertinent and recent research enlightening our understanding of the links between music and emotion by honing in or a specific sub-topic (e.g. how music expresses emotion, how music induces emotion in listeners, how performers communicate emotion, how music can be used to regulate mood and emotion, or aesthetic responses to music performance).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. Music in everyday life. Music is a powerful tool, which can be used to achieve various goals in everyday life. Review pertinent and recent research enlightening our understanding of the links between music and everyday life. Focus on a specific sub-topic (e.g. supporting memory processes and learning, motivation, aiding memory retrieval in ageing, or influencing consumer behaviour).  </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>You will need to identify a specific sub-topic to focus your review on within the selected broad topic area. A narrow focus will enable you to demonstrate a greater depth of critical thinking about the research.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The literature review must include at least 10 recent (e.g. within the last 10 years), scholarly journal articles or book chapters pertinent to your topic and the point of view you are arguing in relation to the topic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Essay Length</strong></p>\n<p>1,500 words</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Essay Structure</strong></p>\n<p>1. Introduction to the topic: Clearly define the scope of your literature review within the broad topic area selected. Show that you have a good understanding of the topic and the research context. Present a focussed aim for the literature review.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. Body of text: To build a cohesive review, synthesise the literature according to common research foci and research outcomes/findings. Highlight points of similarity and difference across the research literature included. Take care to critique rather than simply summarise the research literature. To assist the reader to follow your argument through the body of the text, each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence to orient the reader to the central point of the paragraph. In the following sentences, provide statements and citations to support the key point identified in the topic sentence. End each paragraph with a summary of what you want the reader to take from it and pivot or link to the next paragraph.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Conclusion: The conclusion draws together the key points identified through your critical review of the research and your argument in relation to it. Demonstrate depth of critical thinking about the research on your topic, noting critical contributions and identifying gaps and issues needing to be addressed. Be careful not to simply summarise the research literature cited.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Musical development and learning,</p>\n<p>2. Cognitive processing of music,</p>\n<p>3. Music and emotion,</p>\n<p>4.

Explain and justify your research proposal, or how your idea for the application of research would work and identify where further research is needed to bolster your proposal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>The spoken presentation is 5 minutes in duration, followed by 2 minutes of questions. To ensure equity for all students, there will be strict adherence to the time limits. Each member of the group is required to speak.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Each group prepares a PowerPoint presentation (maximum 6 slides) to support their spoken presentation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The presentation incorporates background information about the real-world issue and applied context, a brief outline of pertinent scholarly research literature, a clear proposal explaining and justifying the idea, why it would work, and where further research is needed to bolster the proposal. Include an APA 7th edition formatted reference list (can be an additional slide).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The spoken presentation should focus on communicating ideas in an effective and efficient manner. Audiovisual materials in the PowerPoint presentation should be minimal in order to keep to time limits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The presentations will take place in the Week 13 lecture and tutorial sessions as scheduled. Presentation will be recorded for marking purposes.</p>\n<p>By the due date: Students will upload their group presentation slides and reference list for marking. Students also submit a written critical reflection (approx. 400 words) about their contributions and learning through the group project process and in-class presentation. The reflection should note the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What they have learned through the group project process, on what skills and knowledge developed that they will take forward into future study and/or career endeavours. Include a brief self-assessment of the individual contribution made to the group - noting personal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities for greater participation/to engage more fully, and elements that threatened your participation/ability to engage fully.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Students complete a peer- and self-assessment task on two occasions during the group project period (beginning-middle and end – dates will be advised via Blackboard). These brief tasks do not individually count towards assessment. They provide the course coordinator in information on group members’ individual effort and contributions to the group work. This allows the course coordinator to identify and help groups who might need more assistance. The final peer- and self-assessment task provides students with the opportunity to reflect on how their group functioned over the group-work period leading up to the spoken presentation. The course coordinator will use this feedback to moderate marks for the group project presentation.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
