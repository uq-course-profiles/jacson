PAFs of 1.1 or less will be directly applied to the mark for each of the design submissions (e.g. if you receive a PAF of 0.8, you will get 80% of the team mark).</p>\n<p><strong>There is no MINIMUM PAF. </strong>Students who fail to submit their PAF by the due date will have their own PAF reduced by 5%. For example, If your PAF was 1.0 but you did not submit your PAF scores, your new PAF = 0.95 * 1.0 = 0.95. If the course coordinator requests, you will be required to present your workbook for review as part of the Peer Moderation process.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
