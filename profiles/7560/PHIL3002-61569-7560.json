Each student takes responsibility for developing 1 scenario and aims to justify what makes that scenario plausible. The focus of your research is on the opportunities and threats posed by the combination of those uncertainties to Australia in 2035 given the broader geopolitical context.</p>\n<p>Draw on megatrends and other data sources in constructing your scenarios. Once you have created your scenarios, workshop to collectively formulate a single group strategy that Australia could adopt that would be able to handle all four scenarios identified by the group. </p>\n<p><strong>Your scenarios must consider the implications of the scenarios you are reasoning about for Australia’s Indigenous communities and your strategy must include directions for mitigating risks to those communities.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a team assignment as befitting strategic planning in organisational contexts, but teams will be required to delegate tasks to individual members and document individual contributions.</p>\n<p>Student groups will present to the class on the progress of their scenario planning exercise and group strategy in weeks 12 or 13 and receive feedback. Students must be prepared to present by week 12. Groups will be randomly selected to present in a given week and should prepare a 5 minute group presentation with each member given a chance to speak to their scenario. Other students are tasked with playing Devil's Advocate, stress testing strategies presented to improve their robustness.</p>\n<p><strong>Part B: Scenario Planning Report (30%) (Individual scenario = 1500 words (25%) + group strategy = 500 words (5%))</strong></p>\n<p>Students will produce individual scenarios, undergoing a peer-review process within their groups and during the praxis workshops to improve on previous drafts. They will then engage in a strategic thinking exercise with their groups to produce a single strategy that would work across any of the scenarios generated to improve outcomes for Australia. The four scenarios, the group strategy, and the author statements (see below) are then compiled into a single report with an Introduction and Conclusion (prepared by the group). Individual scenarios are submitted to Turnitin and the full report sent by email to all course coordinators.</p>\n<p>Scenarios must show evidence of exercising concepts and principles from the strategic thinking skillset (systems, strategic, entrepreneurial, and futures thinking) in the development of the scenarios and group strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Part C: Author Statement (5%) (300 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Each member of the team will be required to submit an author statement documenting their role in the scenario planning process and their contribution to the final product. The author statement should document how the team reasoned collaboratively and made collective decisions and the experience of making autonomous contributions to a planning process. Consult Scenario Planning Task Sheet under Blackboard for more detail and a sample author statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Note on AI: </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<p><strong>Criteria and Marking:</strong></p>\n<p>See Philosophy Criteria Rubric attached under 'Course Files' for more information about the grading criteria and standards.</p>\n<p>Your assignment will be assessed according to the following criteria: </p>\n<p>1.             Ability to construct a well-reasoned and justified scenario.</p>\n<p>2.             Depth and breadth of knowledge and understanding of central issues.</p>\n<p>3.             Ability to work collaboratively to produce a well-reasoned strategy to handle all 4 scenarios.</p>\n<p>4.             Engagement with academic sources and evidence.</p>\n<p>5.             Insight and/or creativity in interpreting texts or constructing a point of view or argument.</p>\n<p>6.             Capacity to produce a coherent and well-written assignment using correct grammar and syntax.</p>\n<p>7.             Appropriately referenced, as per APA (or other standard referencing system) conventions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 7 (High Distinction, 85-100%), your assignment should reflect an exceptional level of achievement.
