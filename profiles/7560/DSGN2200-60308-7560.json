Students will learn how to explore and analyse complex systems using systemic design, circular strategies and models of impact. </p>\n<p>In teams of 4–6, students will produce a report on a specific material or product within their chosen focus area, with a particular emphasis on examining its full life cycle—from extraction and production through use and end-of-life. Using tools such as systems thinking, life cycle analysis, and stakeholder mapping, students will investigate the systemic impacts of the product and identify barriers and opportunities for circular transformation. </p>\n<p>The outputs are as follows:</p>\n<p>1.         PDF report (curated multipage document).</p>\n<p>2.         Presentation Slides (PDF)</p>\n<p>3.         Verbal Presentation in class</p>\n<p>4.         Peer Review Digital Form</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
