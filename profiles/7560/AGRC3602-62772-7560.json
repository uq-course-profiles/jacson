            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p><strong>Background.</strong> </p>\n<p>For this literature review you are to discuss how the use of technology will support sustainable agriculture in a specific context. There is some flexibility to the scale of approach in this literature review. What this means is that you can focus on a particular industry (e.g. mango production), system (e.g. agronomy), or technology (e.g. virtual fencing). The focus of your literature review should centre around the use of technologies and their application in the context of your topic and how this will improve sustainability outcomes in that situation. You will also need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies for use in your specific context. You will need to be very specific with this literature review due to the size constraints, so you will need to be concise and focused. If you are concerned about topic selection, please feel free to discuss your ideas with your course co-ordinator Dr Angela Lees (<a href=\"mailto:a.lees@uq.edu.au\">a.lees@uq.edu.au</a>).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Literature Review Structure. </strong>In your review you will need to cover the following items.</p>\n<p>i)                 define/describe what you are investigating in your review,</p>\n<p>ii)                describe the technology/ies being discussed,</p>\n<p>iii)               discuss the application of the technology/ies, and</p>\n<p>iv)               highlight how they contribute to sustainability, with consideration to the pros and cons for the use of your technology.</p>\n<p>You may find it useful to use the descriptions above to create headings to start your literature review skeleton. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credibility &amp; References. </strong></p>\n<p>Given that this is a literature review you will need to do lots of reading, so you are encouraged to choose a topic that is of interest to you. Selecting a topic that is of interest to you will make this task more enjoyable to complete, otherwise you will find it a dreadful task that you will take nothing away from. In addition, it is advisable that you select a topic that you are able to find scientific resources easily.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>General Formatting and Communication.</strong></p>\n<p>The main body of the literature review should be 2500 words, this includes your in-text citations, BUT excludes the reference list provided at the end. For this literature review, I am requesting the use of Journal of Animal Science formatting. The reason is simple, in my opinion this is the most simplistic and discipline relevant citation style that exists for us. The general rules are simple. Your literature must be typed, 1.5 to 2.0 line spacings are ok, font size 12, in Australian (British) English and neatly presented. Communicating your thoughts in a concise and grammatically correct manner is essential to any written document, here at The University of Queensland or outside this institution. </p>\n<p>A more detailed Description and Rubric will be provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence.</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be referenced appropriately.

A SWOT analysis is used to assess and evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a business. The outcomes from a SWOT analysis can be utilised as a strategic planning tool to progress and achieve strategic targets and business goals. For this report, you will need to consider sustainability in the context of your chosen agricultural enterprise, remembering that sustainability encompasses multiple components (including financial, environmental, ethical, social and product quality) that your focus enterprise is facing or has faced. For your SWOT the following might help you to get thinking:</p>\n<p>·        Strengths – positive factors that the enterprise has control over, i.e. what is this enterprise doing well?</p>\n<p>·        Weaknesses – does the enterprise have weaknesses or negative factors that appear to be within their control, i.e. what might this enterprise not be doing well?</p>\n<p>·        Opportunities – what positive factors exist that are outside the enterprise's control that they might be able to harness more effectively, i.e. what are the overall industry sustainability targets?</p>\n<p>·        Threats – are their negative factors beyond the control of the enterprise, i.e. activism, legislation out of your control. For example, what could potentially harm us?</p>\n<p>During the visits to the various enterprises, make sure to make relevant notes and ask questions that will provide you with the necessary information for your SWOT analysis.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Report Structure. </strong></p>\n<p>In your report you will need to cover the following items:</p>\n<p>1.      Introduction - here, you will need to define sustainability in the context of your enterprise.</p>\n<p>2.      Enterprise Overview - this is the who, what, when and where of your report.</p>\n<p>3.      Strengths</p>\n<p>4.      Weaknesses</p>\n<p>5.      Opportunities</p>\n<p>6.      Threats</p>\n<p>7.      Conclusions - summarise how your enterprise is performing from a sustainability context.</p>\n<p>You may find it useful to use the items above to create headings to start your report skeleton.
