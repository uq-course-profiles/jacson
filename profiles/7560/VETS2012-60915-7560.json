Importantly, reflection also defines a pathway forward to identify weaknesses and to consider what remediation must be undertaken, in preparation for the demands of the clinical phase of the BVSc program.  </p>\n<p>Students must complete a succinct reflection on their PC-WIL industry placement experience. </p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reflection must individually address the described learning objectives (listed below) in the context of your PC-WIL industry placement.</li>\n<li>Word limit is 1000 words, with a 200-word tolerance. </li>\n<li>A diverse approach to the format of the reflection is acceptable: i.e. you may use alternative forms of media such as PowerPoints, pictures, videos, text, tables, diagrams or a combination of these arrangements. (Please note – photos and videos only with the appropriate permission from the applicable industry partner).</li>\n<li>A passing grade for this reflection is a requirement for the completion of this course.</li>\n<li>Enquiries related to this Assessment Task should be directed to <a href=\"mailto:vetenquiries@uq.edu.au\">vetenquiries@uq.edu.au</a>.
