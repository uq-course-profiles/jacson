Physical exam of this patient revealed a 1 cm mass, reasonably firm, caudal to its coelom, which was consistent with its left kidney. To further confirm diagnosis, an ultrasound was carried out on this patient. Ultrasound revealed a vascularized hyperechoic mass in the caudal coelom.</p>\n<p>An exploratory surgery was carried out in this patient. Prior to premedication, the patient’s vitals were taken and recorded as followed: HR 70, RR 4 and temperature: 23.8. Patient was premedicated with Hydromorphone 0.5mg/kg (0.02ml) via intramuscular injection (IM). It was then induced with Alfaxalone 10mg/kg (0.38ml) via IM and was intubated with a size 24G catheter. Throughout the procedure, patient was maintained at 0.5% oxygen due to its size and was connected to a ventilator. Patient was monitored with a capnograph, a Doppler and an ECG. The enterectomy revealed a faecal impaction, which was successfully removed. It seemed like there was potentially a partial GIT wall perforation from the hard segment.</p>\n<p>The patient had an uneventful recovery post surgery and was given the following medications:</p>\n<p>1.      Tramadol 10mg/kg 0.02ml IM q24 hours</p>\n<p>2.      Ceftazidime 20mg/kg 0.02ml IM q72 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Patient outcome:</strong></p>\n<p>Patient did well post surgery and was sent home after a night of monitoring with the following medications for the next 10 days.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

Research must be evident from various literature sources.</li>\n<li>Conclusion: Should also include nursing key points learned from case, specials skills and/or specialised monitoring equipment utilised during the case management. </li>\n<li>Presentations should be created using PowerPoint or Prezi and brought on a memory stick.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you wish to take photographs to support your presentation, you must seek permission from the practice you are attending and the patient details must be de-identified for confidentiality.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
