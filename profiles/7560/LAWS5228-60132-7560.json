We will also discuss current and emerging areas of law reform and litigation. This task gives you the opportunity to choose an area of law, conduct research, and present your ideas as to how the law could achieve better privacy outcomes.</p>\n<p>You are encouraged to discuss your proposed topic with the Course Coordinator.</p>\n<p><strong>Due date</strong></p>\n<p>In class, you will be shown how to book a session for your group presentation.

There may also be some times released for the first week of exam block if required (exact date and time TBC, depending on student enrolment numbers).</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Each oral presentation session will be 3 hours, to allow up to 10 to 12 groups to present. All group members must be present for the session. Your group will be presenting to the course coordinator and a small group of fellow students.</p>\n<p>You may use a range of media to support your in-person presentation e.g. PowerPoint, poster, infographic, short video element, handouts.</p>\n<p><strong>Group input</strong></p>\n<p>All group members must contribute to selecting, developing, researching, and presenting the topic. The oral component of the presentation may be given by a single group member or some/all of the members. However, all group members must be prepared to answer questions during the Q&amp;A component. Every group member will receive the same mark, unless a case is made otherwise. Two assessors will review the presentation (in-person or a recording) to provide moderation of grades.</p>\n<p>Resources to support your group work will be provided on the course BlackBoard and discussed in class.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Individual reflection 10% (1-2 pages maximum)</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of your presentation (i.e. by midnight), you will submit an INDIVIDUAL reflection on your experiences during this task. This will include reflection on your topic choice, your contribution to the work, and the group work process. Further guidance will be provided in class.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
