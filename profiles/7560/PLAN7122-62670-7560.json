The assignments are to be submitted via Blackboard Ultra: Weeks 4, 6, 8, 10</p>\n<p><strong>Assignment 1: Site Mapping </strong></p>\n<p>Task: Using base maps and aerial imagery, students will produce a detailed tracing of the study area on Sketchup, identifying key elements of street hierarchy, open space structure, building footprints.</p>\n<p>Submission format: One A3 analytical map + brief annotation (max 200 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Assignment 2: Lynch Diagramming</strong></p>\n<p>Task: Students will conduct a Kevin Lynch-inspired urban analysis, identifying elements such as nodes, edges, paths, districts, and landmarks in the project area. This will be accompanied by a conceptual urban structure diagram that captures spatial relationships and user experience.</p>\n<p>Submission format: One A3 Lynch map + conceptual diagram</p>\n<p><strong>Assignment 3: Street Section Study – Existing and Proposed </strong></p>\n<p>Task: Produce two street sections for the selected street:</p>\n<p>• One showing the existing condition, including buildings, streetscape elements, setbacks, and movement types.</p>\n<p>• One showing a proposed design intervention that enhances walkability, sustainability, and urban amenity.</p>\n<p>Submission format: Two street sections (A3 horizontal format)</p>\n<p><strong>Assignment 4: Placemaking Intervention Concept</strong></p>\n<p>Task: Develop a placemaking concept plan for a targeted site. Students will identify a small-scale intervention (for example, sponge park, active frontage upgrade, street activation) and prepare a plan or axonometric view supported by a short narrative.</p>\n<p>Submission format: One A3 concept board + 150-words design rationale</p>\n<p>Assessment Criteria:</p>\n<p>• Response to site context and community use</p>\n<p>• Quality of spatial thinking</p>\n<p>• Design communication and layout</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment task to be completed without use of AI or MT:</strong> This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

Turnitin is accessed through the course Blackboard site. Turnitin also checks for plagiarism or instances where the original work of others is not appropriately acknowledged.  Students are advised to commence assignment uploads with sufficient amount of time (consider possible technical problems with computers, internet speed, etc). After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment. Students who are experiencing upload issues must advise the Course Coordinator immediately by email and should include screenshots and a copy of the assessment for submission. To meet professional accreditation, public engagement and quality assurance obligations, digital copies of all course assessment items must be submitted in addition to any hard copy submission requirements specified in individual Course / Studio Outlines. Any physical models should be photographed and a minimum of two photographs describing the complete and full model must be included in the digital submission.  </p>",
