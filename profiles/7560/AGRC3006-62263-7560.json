The location, paddock and environmental conditions for the paddock are described below.</p>\n<p>a.    Paddock size – 50 ha</p>\n<p>b.    Location – Near Conondale, which is in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland (Burnett Mary Catchment), approximately 114 km north of Brisbane.</p>\n<p>c.    What the pasture will be used for – Fattening beef cattle</p>\n<p>d.    Intended forage/pasture use – Permanent pasture (&gt; 5 years)</p>\n<p>e.    Annual rainfall – 1690 mm</p>\n<p>f.     Paddock features – The paddock is relatively flat and has been previously cleared. It has been cultivated several times to provide a fine seed bed to maximise pasture establishment</p>\n<p>g.    Soil texture – Medium (loam; clay loam)</p>\n<p>h.    Soil pH – Neutral (pH 6.5 – 7.5)</p>\n<p>i.     Soil drainage – Well drained</p>\n<p>j.     Level of soil salinity – Low (0-2 dS/m)</p>\n<p>2.    From the shortlisted options, select 2 grasses and 2 legumes that you consider most appropriate for this scenario and provide justification for your selections. Factors to consider could include their ease of establishment, compatibility to grow well together, their quality as a forage source, and their livestock production potential (e.g. liveweight gains, stocking rates). The farmer is also adamant that he does not want any of the selected species to have weed potential. <strong>Note that in the Pasture Australia Selection Tool, shortlisted species highlighted in green are the most suitable, followed by those highlighted in orange</strong>.</p>\n<p>3.    Using the information provided in step 1 and 2, use a generative AI tool of your choice to identify 2 improved pastures grasses and legumes for this scenario. Make sure that it is requested to provide justification for the species recommended.</p>\n<p>4.    In terms of similarities and differences, compare the results (i.e. the grasses and legumes selected) obtained by yourself after using the Pastures Australia Selection Tool and considering the available information about each species, versus the recommendations generated through A.I.</p>\n<p>5.    After considering all the gathered information, conclude with your final recommendation of 2 improved grasses and 2 legumes for the described scenario.</p>\n<p>In the report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include an introduction that (a) outlines the benefits of improved pastures (use supporting references), (b) identifies the ways that landholders can get advice to make informed decisions about suitable pastures to grow for their situations and (c) highlights the objectives of the exercise.</li>\n<li>In your own words, summarise the unique characteristics of the paddock (i.e. rainfall, soil type etc.).</li>\n<li>Summarise how the Pastures Australia Selection Tool was used and list all the grasses and legumes that were identified as suitable for growing in the paddock. Identify the 2 improved grasses and legumes that you consider most appropriate for this scenario, including justification for your selections (see factors to consider in step 2 above). The fact sheets in the Tropical Forages database (<a href=\"https://www.tropicalforages.info/text/intro/index.html\">https://www.tropicalforages.info/text/intro/index.html</a>) are a good source of specific information on individual pasture species and will help with your shortlisting of suitable grasses and legumes. Inclusion of some scientific articles to justify your selections is also recommended.</li>\n<li>Provide a summary of the improved grasses and legumes recommended from the A.I. tool and the justification provided.</li>\n<li>Provide a comparison (i.e. similarities and differences) of the results (i.e. the grasses and legumes selected) obtained by yourself after using the Pastures Australia Selection Tool and considering the available information about each species, versus the recommendations generated through A.I.</li>\n<li>Conclude with a summary of the objective of the exercise and your key recommendations after carefully considering all the information gathered through use of the Pastures Australia Selection Tool and A.I.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You must reference all sources in text and provide a reference list at the end of your assignment.

Data from the practical will be provided to all students via Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Method</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to work in small groups to estimate the yield and botanical composition of a pasture using different sampling methods. Specifically, you are required to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sample approximately 20 quadrats (50 cm x 50 cm) per group over the paddock to measure yield and botanical composition using various methods. Use a systematic grid pattern to locate the position of the quadrats. For each quadrat, note the yield score (1-10), rising plate meter measurement, the % of each component by dry weight, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dominant species if 3 species are present.</li>\n<li>Determine yield by the visual scoring method. Yield of the pasture can be measured by a visual scoring technique where each of the quadrats is scored between 1 and 10 (1 = lowest yield and 10 = highest yield in the paddock). To calibrate your yield scores, you need to select at least three reference quadrats against which all other quadrats are compared. You should locate the lowest yield in the paddock and give that pasture a yield score of 1 (note: bare ground is equivalent to a yield score of 0). Conversely, locate the highest yield in the paddock and give that pasture a yield score of 10. You should also locate a medium yield location and give a score of 4, 5 or 6 depending on its relative yield compared to the 1 and 10 scores. <strong>Spending time calibrating visual scores as a group is essential for accurate and consistent results.</strong></li>\n<li>Determine yield by the rising plate meter method. Rising plate meters can quickly estimate pasture yield by measuring the height of pasture under the weight of a standard plate (usually 4kg/m2).</li>\n<li>At the end of the sampling exercise, each group will provide yield scores and RPM measurements (only one group) for 10 quadrats that have been located to give a spread of scores from 1 to 10. These quadrats will then be cut to a standard height of 5 cm above ground level, with the herbage from each quadrat to be placed in individual bags.</li>\n<li>Place the paper bags in an oven and dry at 65oC for 48 hours. Weigh each bag, subtracting the weight of the packet so that you have a dry weight, yield score and a rising plate meter measurement for each of the hand-cut quadrats.</li>\n<li>All the data will be combined and provided to all students to undertake calculations of pasture yield, composition and stocking rates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Calculations</strong></p>\n<p>Calculations will be discussed in class and will include (a) Determining whether enough samples (i.e. quadrats) were taken to accurately measure the yield of pasture using both the visual score and rising plate methods, (b) quantifying and comparing the yield and botanical composition of the pastures using two techniques, and (3) determining the carrying capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Report submission</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Report requirements will be discussed in class but require the following sections - Introduction, Adequacy of the sampling regime, Calibration graphs and equations, Mean dry matter yield of the pasture, Botanical composition, Carrying capacity, Conclusion, References.</li>\n<li>Word Length should not exceed 2000 words exclusive of references, graphs, tables and figures. For all references (recommend using APA 7th referencing style), provide a reference list at the end of your report. No marks will be given for copied materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
