These tasks focus on core techniques and workflows essential for applying software creatively in urban design. The exercises build technical fluency while encouraging exploration of spatial ideas through digital tools. The exercises will be assessed by the tutor. The student will get one of 3 options for marking: 0 points (the exercise was not presented); 1 point (the exercise is presented but needs more work or is incomplete); 2 points (the exercise is presented and is of good quality). The marks will be added for a total max. of 20 points.
