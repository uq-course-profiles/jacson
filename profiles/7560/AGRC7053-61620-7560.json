Practical Classes are scheduled every 2-3 weeks. The practicals run for approximately 3 hours and are a combination of laboratory-based and field-based activities. To obtain a mark for the practical classes students must participate and complete the associated exercises (submitting the practical report via Blackboard - Turnitin). If you do not participate in a practical class, or do not provide evidence of your attendance (i.e. signing attendance sheet), <strong>your report will not be marked/graded. Refer to late submission notes for more information.</strong></p>\n<p>Details about the Practical will be provided within a Practical Manual, which will be made available on Blackboard site before the scheduled practical, with additional specifics about report preparation and report submission.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Report 1: Field assessment of soil properties and constraints.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will be able to describe a soil profile using field methods to assess the suitability, limitations of the soil and potential of the soil for plant growth and potential land use. This report will assess learning objectives <strong>1, 2 &amp; 5.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Report 2:</strong> <strong>Effects of organic matter on soil properties</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will investigate the effect of various organic matter sources on soil properties including respiration and bulk density.
