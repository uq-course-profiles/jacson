Students can further incorporate concepts of dental tissue engineering and how this is used to manage specific conditions.</li>\n<li>The detailed review will inform the scripting and creation of an engaging 10 minute video by the student team.</li>\n<li>Student teams will need to contribute as per a Couse Team Charter provided at start of semester, and this team charter will need to be submitted as part of the final submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The assessment will be marked to published criteria standards that will be provided via the learning management system.</p>\n<p>All three components will need to be submitted by each team before the due date.</p>\n<p>Students will also rate team member contributions and a peer assessment factor will be applied to the final mark.</p>\n<p>Detailed task descriptions, marking criteria and expectations will be provided on Blackboard at start of semester.</p>\n<p>Learning activities will be scaffolded to permit students time to create and build rapport to complete team based learning activities in class.</p>\n<p>Please note that use of flowcharts, graphics and images should be from UQ licenced sources such as Adobe Stock and all material must be appropriately acknowledged as per the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p>Note to student teams: You must acknowledge where you used AI in this assessment, including where you have directly quoted or paraphrased AI-generated content or used tools to summarise readings, brainstorm ideas, plan your process, or for editing/ proofreading purposes or for video content creation. You may be asked to acknowledge AI using a cover sheet, form, template or table.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
