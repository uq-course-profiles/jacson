Visit <a href=\"https://courseplacements.languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/\">https://courseplacements.languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/</a> </p>\n<p>Completion of this Language Placement Questionnaire is a compliance hurdle requirement in many courses. This requirement aims to ensure that you are placed in the most appropriate language course based on your current level of linguistic proficiency. Your responses, along with the possible submission of short writing or speaking sample, help us match you to a course that aligns with your previous (formal or informal) language learning experiences.</p>\n<p>While this is an unsupervised, individual online task, it is not in your best interest to use generative AI tools. If the work you submit does not reflect your actual language ability, you may be placed in a course that is not appropriate for your level, which could negatively affect your learning and performance. This may also be considered an act of student misconduct under the UQ Student Code of Conduct due to the misrepresentation of your capabilities.</p>\n<p>Please note that this course includes a hurdle assessment task where the use of generative AI or MT tools is not allowed and you will be expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of your own work without the assistance of AI or MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
