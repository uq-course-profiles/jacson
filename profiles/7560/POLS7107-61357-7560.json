This involves appreciating the \"interaction of the market and powerful actors\" (Ravenhill, 2020). IPE examines the links between domestic and international economic and political dynamics (Cohen, 2007) and the role  of the state and market forces in shaping the domestic and international economy. IPE is concerned with the contemporary dynamics of ‘globalisation’ and ‘de-globalisation’ and governance problems in the international economy.

In the neoliberal era, financialization means that finance is the dominant force, deeply penetrating even the \"real economy\" and daily life. Ordinary citizens are increasingly exposed to financial calamities across various fronts. The purpose of this topic is to show how these global financial flows occur and enter crises, and how these concretely shape people’s lives. Financial markets are fundamentally centred on risk management, but critically, they do not eliminate risk; instead, they primarily transfer and reallocate it. This inherent characteristic was profoundly illustrated by the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), which saw risks shift from over-leveraged borrowers, through the financial markets, and ultimately onto governments and citizens. </p></p></div></td>",

This week delves into the intricate relationship between global trade, production, and uneven development, moving beyond conventional explanations to explore how these processes are fundamentally shaped by power dynamics, historical legacies of colonialism, and deeply entrenched social inequalities. The key point of this week is to link trade with production because trade is always trade in something and thus trade always also entails production. We will critically examine the concepts of trade, production, and protectionism, revealing their underlying social and political dimensions, and demonstrating how they perpetuate or challenge existing hierarchies in the global economy. As Cox argues, trade is not merely the exchange of goods but a deep expression of underlying power relations, class struggles, and state strategies shaping global production processes (Cox, 1987).  The aim this week is to equip you with a nuanced understanding of how macro-level global processes manifest in the everyday lives of individuals and communities, especially in the Global South.</p></p></div></td>",

This unevenness in development is intrinsically linked to capitalist expansion and power structures, shaping the circumstances under which people labor globally. Uneven development means that people engage in labor under vastly different conditions across the world. These disparities include variations in wages and opportunities, the prevalence of servile and unfree labor, gender inequalities, and differing legal statuses regarding work and pay.
