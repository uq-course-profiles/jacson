Demonstrate evidence of comprehension of the texts assigned for reading each week through preparation and participation in the tutorial.

Students are expected to demonstrate a <strong>familiarity with the primary and secondary literature on the topic</strong> and to take a stand on the conceptual or textual problems being addressed. <strong>Students prepare an argument map in advance and the poster content must be aligned to the argument map.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Students must seek approval for their choice of sources from their tutor as part of the research design task.</strong></p>\n<p>The word limit is a hard limit. There is no 10% leeway, so don't ask. For an A0 poster, use at least Arial 24 pt type for text and 32 pt for title and ensure the poster is legible.</p>\n<p><strong>Due date: </strong> 30/10/2025 at 13:00pm.</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Posters must represent at least two distinct views from early modern philosophy on the philosophical problem under discussion.</li>\n<li>Students must consult multiple sources (including primary and secondary sources) and incorporate them effectively either to raise problems for the views under discussion or as suggesting possible solutions.

This is followed by a short question period (2 minutes). All students must be prepared to present by 30/11/2025 at 13:00. The order of presentation will be based on a random selection of student names. The poster session runs during the tutorials and the lecture time if needed.</p>\n<p>Students should explain the philosophical problem they are discussing; the competing positions from the history of philosophy they examined in their research; and their own reasoned position on the subject matter.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that in 3 minutes you can only speak 300 words!</p>\n<p>All assessment must comply with academic misconduct and integrity policies.
