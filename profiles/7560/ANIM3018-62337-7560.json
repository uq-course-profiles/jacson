Students will develop maps of their study location, using remotely sensed data from open-access government databases and gain experience using QGIS. The mapping exercise assignment will assess student's ability to (1) understand GIS in the context of wildlife science; (2) understand official vegetation classifications used in Queensland; (3) explain the region targeted by the mapping exercise, and (3) create a high–quality map.</p>\n<p>The practical exercises are a major part of this course and provide a hands-on understanding of the theoretical knowledge you will gain through the lectures. Demonstration of the field techniques are compulsory. Learning objectives 2 and 3 cannot be achieved without participating in practicals. This assessment on “Mapping Exercise” cannot be completed unless a student participates in practicals throughout the semester. </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
