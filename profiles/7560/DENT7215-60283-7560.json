Submit the completed form to the Course Coordinator via ePortfolio.</p>\n<p>This component includes three guided parts: 1. A course overview, 2. Case planning, and 3. A feedback summary.</p>\n<p>This form helps set focused clinical learning goals for the semester. It also provides an opportunity to reflect on previous feedback and identify actions for improving clinical performance.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Mid-semester portfolio review</strong></p>\n<p>All three components are submitted to the Course Coordinator by 5pm Monday, the first day back after the in-semester break.</p>\n<p>This component includes three parts: 1. A well-being check, 2. Case tallies (with a de-identified Patient Management System Treatment Report uploaded), and 3. A self-evaluation of clinical performance so far throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>This mid-semester task supports development as a reflective, self-directed learner and prepares you for a feedback meeting with the lead dentist in the UQ Herston Dental Clinic (Clinic 2.1).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 3: End-of-semester portfolio review and case tallies</strong></p>\n<p>Submit both components to your Course Coordinator by 5pm Friday of the last week of semester via ePortfolio.</p>\n<p>This component includes two parts: 1. Case tallies for the semester (with a de-identified Patient Management System Treatment Report uploaded), and 2. An End-of-semester Reflection and Feedback Form.</p>\n<p>This task helps to reflect on clinical progress, feedback integration, and future growth.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Course-specific session sign-off forms (submitted after each clinical session)</strong></p>\n<p>These forms are essential for tracking performance and must be completed at the end of every AM or PM session where you see a patient. If no patient was seen, submit the Dental Assisting/FTA form instead.</p>\n<p>Your session form is submitted to, and assessed by, your Clinical Educator and includes:</p>\n<p>·       Clinical performance (all sessions)</p>\n<p>·       Discipline-specific performance (only if you performed relevant procedures)</p>\n<p>·       Fitness to practise (must pass; assessed as EM or ENM only. If you receive an ENM in this category, you will receive an ENM as your overall grade for the session.)</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><em>Student marking expectations for each semester are calibrated to your year and stage in the DMD program. You are not being marked against the performance of a fully qualified dentist (4.0 standard), but rather according to where you should be for your level of clinical training. Clinical educators will adjust their marking expectations accordingly as you progress throughout the program.</em></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Overall session grade categories</p>\n<p>The only weighted grade for each session is the ‘Overall Grade’ that are assigned the following values:</p>\n<p>·       0= Expectations Not Met (ENM) = &lt;50%</p>\n<p>·       2= Developing (D) = 50 to &lt;69%</p>\n<p>·       3= Expectations Met (EM) = 69-&lt;88%</p>\n<p>·       4= Exceeds Expectations = 88-100%</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Minimum performance requirement: </strong></p>\n<p>The pass requirements are based on the DMD Year Level and Semester level, where the average overall score must be a minimum of:</p>\n<p>DMD Year 2, Summer Semester <strong>≥ 2.5/4.0 (~62.5%)</strong></p>\n<p>DMD Year 2, Semester 1 <strong>≥ 2.8/4.0 (~70%)</strong></p>\n<p>DMD Year 2, Semester 2 <strong>≥ 2.8/4.0 (~70%)</strong></p>\n<p>DMD Year 3, Semester 1 <strong>≥ 3.0/4.0 (~75%)</strong></p>\n<p>DMD Year 3, Semester 2 <strong>≥ 3.0/4.0 (~75%)</strong></p>\n<p>DMD Year 4, Semester 1 <strong>≥ 3.2/4.0 (~80%)</strong></p>\n<p>In accordance with PPL Assessment Procedure Section 3 Part J, supplementary assessment will NOT be available for clinical practice performance (portfolio) as professional competencies are developed over a 16 week practicum.
