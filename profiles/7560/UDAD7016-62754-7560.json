This plan explores a selected section of Brisbane’s emerging Blue-Green Network, including its surrounding open spaces, public places, and community assets.</p>\n<p>The OLF is a spatial and functional design framework that articulates a team’s vision for Olympic Legacy at the precinct scale. It must integrate ‘gold places’—high-quality, inclusive public spaces—with supporting blue-green infrastructure that enhances mobility, water management, ecological performance, and community wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Working collaboratively, each team:</p>\n<p>• Defines a precinct vision that reflects the Olympic Legacy’s values and long-term aspirations.</p>\n<p>• Establishes a set of site-specific design principles and spatial strategies to guide future development.</p>\n<p>• Identifies key urban initiatives that support social, environmental, and economic resilience.</p>\n<p>• Maps the integration of green and blue systems with public space networks, mobility corridors, and community destinations.</p>\n<p>• Investigates local communities to understand their diverse needs, values and aspirations, and proposes ideas for bold legacy initiatives—ranging from projects and policies to targets, programs, and other mechanisms—that foster meaningful community participation and long-term transformation.</p>\n<p>Both OLF and OLPP must respond to the unique characteristics of the selected precinct, while also contributing to the broader city-wide Blue-Green Network Map (BGNM) initiated during the workshop. The OLPP serves as the strategic foundation for Assessment Task 3 (A03), where students individually develop a detailed Place Design Toolkit to implement and test the OLPP’s spatial strategies at a finer grain.</p>\n<p>A01 is set as a sequence, i.e. it includes tasks in two consecutive weeks:</p>\n<p>- Presentation and Review: 4/09/2025, 10 am (video and presentation slide deck to be uploaded to Blackboard Ultra by 9 am)</p>\n<p>- Booklet digital submission: 10/09/2025, 4 pm</p>\n<p>A01 emphasises collaborative visioning, contextual analysis, and strategic design thinking—laying the groundwork for place-based interventions that can deliver a meaningful and enduring Olympic Legacy. Participation, engagement and contribution to teamwork during the intensive workshop and across the first weeks of the semester (1-6) leading to A01 will be evaluated through a Group Peer Assessment process and may affect the A01 individual grade. If, for whatever reason, you find that your group is not functioning effectively, please contact your Course Coordinator for support.</p>\n<p><strong>A01 Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p>1. Video documentation (max 5 min) </p>\n<p>2. Presentation slide deck</p>\n<p>3. Team oral presentation (20 min team presentation + 10 min feedback)</p>\n<p>4. Olympic Legacy Framework booklet (A4 portrait, colour) – including BGNM (finalised), vision, principles, OLPP, and Program of Community Engagement (PCE).</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI and/or MT</strong> to support learning: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.
