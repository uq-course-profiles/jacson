Students are expected to behave professionally at all times. If they are unable to attend the workplace for any reason, they must contact their supervisor to let them know and provide an explanation. The course coordinator will consult with students’ supervisors at the end of semester for allocating a mark for this component.</p>\n<p>·        <strong>Active participation</strong> <strong>in meetings</strong> <strong>(10 marks)</strong>: Students are expected to attend and actively participate in the 4 course meetings (weeks 2, 6, 9 and 12). Activities will include discussion of internship progress, small group work, and scaffolding tasks.</p>\n<p>·        <strong>Journal posts</strong> reflecting on the internship and responding to the posts of others <strong>(10 marks): </strong>Upload a 150-word post each week (weeks 2-11), by Friday 4pm, to the Learn@UQ ENGL3020 course site discussion board. The entries may, for example: record tasks, reflect on experiences and challenges, critically evaluate the aims and progress of the project, or reflect more broadly on the aims and methods of the type of work that the project represents and how it is situated within the humanities. In addition to uploading your own journal post, students are expected to respond briefly (1-2 sentences) to 2 posts from others each week.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer review</strong> <strong>of scaffolding tasks</strong> (Draft Abstract and Draft Annotated Bibliography) <strong>(10 marks)</strong>: This component involves bringing a draft abstract and draft annotated bibliography for the research project to the week 9 meeting and providing constructive feedback to peers on their draft abstracts and annotated bibliographies (3 entries).</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completion of tasks set by the internship supervisor in a timely way; organisational skills; a professional and courteous attitude to supervisors; and having a proactive attitude to the internship.

(10 marks)</li>\n<li>Journal posts: completion of 10 weekly posts (weeks 2-11) (approx. 150 words) evidencing reflection on the internship; and responding briefly to the posts of others (2 per week) (10 marks).</li>\n<li>Peer review: providing constructive feedback in a collegial way on the draft abstracts and draft annotated bibliographies of other students in the group (10 marks).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI and MT</strong>:</p>\n<p>·        <strong>Completion of tasks set by the internship supervisor (secure assessment)</strong>: This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

This should consider the skills and experiences you’ve gained throughout the internship and how your work has developed throughout the semester. You may wish to consider ways that you could have done things differently to expand or improve on the outcomes, processes, and achievements, or ways the organisation could improve methodology and management of future projects. In the essay, you might quote your own recorded comments/musings at particular times during the internship to underpin your reflection of your own and the organisation's work. You may wish to quote from secondary sources on the practice of reflection and/or journaling, however it is not essential. If you choose to cite secondary sources, you should include a Works Cited list in MLA style.</p>\n<p>\tAs John Cowan suggests: </p>\n<p>Reflection is well established as an essential component of lifelong learning and professional development… It is taken here as thinking in which a learner identifies and seeks an answer to a question whose answer, preferably in generalised form, is likely to be of practical use to them. The learner deliberately thinks about past or impending actions, with a view to effecting future improvement… This process can take place within a written, keyed or narrated reflective journal and should lead to new understandings and appreciations. [...] Reflection begins from a question whose useful answer the person concerned desires to identify. It progresses into thinking whose focus relative to the activity from which it hopes to learn is determined by the timing of the chosen question. It should entail sustained questioning and especially self-questioning by any person who reflects privately.
