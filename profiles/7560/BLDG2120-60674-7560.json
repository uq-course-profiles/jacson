Students first work together to analyse the characteristics of a particular climate zone (e.g. arid, tropical, temperate etc), and the challenges of living and building there. Each student then selects a specific example of vernacular architecture from that climate zone and analyses the strategies that have been used to adapt. These include organisation and planning, materials, openings and shade, ventilation, vegetation and landscaping and other characteristics. Students recommend potential strategies to enhance the passive design performance of their case study. Finally, the group identifies common climatic adaptations from among their case studies.    </p>\n<p>This work will form a shared resource document for all of you, which will be valuable for your next assignment and your future studies. The group reports will follow a template provided to ensure consistency and save your time to focus on analysis. </p>\n<p><strong>Group work note:</strong></p>\n<p>Group work plays a significant part of this course, and has been incorporated into the subject to help prepare you for working in architectural practice. Exercises early in the semester will help to form groups and to make clear agreements between group members about how to communicate, how to share resources, how to give feedback and advice to other group members and the consequences for any group member for not following the group agreement. Group work can be difficult, particularly as the stresses of semester mount and assessment items for other subjects are due. If you find that your group is not functioning effectively please contact the course co-ordinator for support as early as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex / authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.  To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
