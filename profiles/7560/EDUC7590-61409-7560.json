In completing this task, you will deepen your appreciation of educational technologies, including ICTs, and enrich your perspectives of technology, its impacts and consequences. The task requires you to demonstrate a knowledge and deep understanding of technology, including as intended and described by the Australian Curriculum: Technologies, which will form a solid foundation for the planning of learning and teaching experiences for your students at any year level.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description</strong></p>\n<p>Your task is to prepare a discussion based on an informed analysis and evaluation of a contemporary or historical teaching ICT resource or technology. The identified ICT resource or technology may be a specific tool (e.g., a particular iPad app) or a category of similar technology tools (e.g., behaviour management applications), but must be focused enough to create a coherent discussion. It should also be of interest to you, relevant to the classroom context, and negotiated with the course coordinator. You may wish to frame an inquiry question to respond to in your discussion. Suggestions for technologies and inquiry questions will be provided. Students are encouraged to discuss ideas and are permitted to choose the same or overlapping focuses, but all work submitted should be sufficiently unique to the individual student.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Critical Discussion should include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis of the purpose, context, specifications and constraints of the technology</li>\n<li>Analysis of advantages, disadvantages, and aspects of appropriateness</li>\n<li>Consideration for the safe, responsible and ethical use of this technology</li>\n<li>Demonstration of your understanding of technology and the technology process</li>\n<li>Attention to multiple perspectives and/or differing viewpoints</li>\n<li>Recommendations for use based on synthesis of the above; potential improvements to the technology may also be suggested</li>\n<li>Credible supporting references, appropriately employed.

Judgements must be based on the evidence, or demonstrations, of student performance, and on sound reasoning from defined and appropriate criteria. Moderation serves to improve and refine judgements across groups of people responsible for making these judgements. It ensures consistency and coherence between judgements across classrooms, schools, and districts. This task will help you to develop, practise, and refine your ability to make appropriate professional judgements.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This task has three stages:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assess Sample to Generate Cognitive Commentary and Provide Feedback</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will receive an authentic Technologies assessment task brief (including criteria and standards) and an assessment sample, which have been sourced from a local classroom. You are expected to assess the sample, keeping notes or annotating the sample (as notes-to-self) as you generate your judgement. You should apply the assessment criteria and standards from the task brief in your judgement, and award a grade on a scale from A – E.</li>\n<li>Prepare a cognitive commentary. A cognitive commentary explicates the process and reasoning underpinning your judgements, with references to the assessment sample as evidence, and to the standards and criteria described in the task brief. <em>(Commentary is approximately 750 words; annotations are not included in word count)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Prepare constructive feedback for the primary student who completed the task.

You should keep accurate and reflective records of the moderation discussions.</li>\n<li>Based on these discussions, you will also revise your annotations, cognitive commentary, and feedback to the student as necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research-Informed Reflection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare a research-informed reflection of the moderation process, describing the extent to which judgements made prior to the moderation discussion remained stable or changed because of the discussion. You should articulate your learning about the use of standards to inform your professional judgements, referring to relevant research literature. You should also discuss your understanding of the purpose of providing timely and appropriate feedback to students on their learning. <em>(Research-informed reflection is approximately 750 words)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From this process, you will submit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The work sample annotations (notes-to-self) and cognitive commentary (~750 words)</li>\n<li>The grade and feedback to the student (~250 words)</li>\n<li>The reflection on the moderation discussion (~750 words)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These products will be constructed individually (i.e., not with peers).

Your task is to prepare a unit plan for the integrated teaching of Technologies, and supply annotations which explain and justify your choices regarding learning and teaching activities and strategies. The integrating subject area should be consistent with your subject specialisation (e.g., English or Mathematics) and provide evidence of your developing knowledge of content and pedagogical content knowledge.

The main content is to be from the Technologies Curriculum (Design or Digital) but the unit should integrate subject matter aligning with your subject specialisation (e.g.., English or Mathematics).

The sources for any ideas, strategies, activities, resources, and justifications should be acknowledged and appropriately referenced using APA Style.
