You will be given <strong>20 minutes</strong> to write and revise a short poem draft.</p>\n<p>Each poem will be written in a <strong>designated form</strong>, using <strong>specific poetic techniques</strong>. These poetic techniques will be discussed in advance in the lectures.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a free verse poem</li>\n<li>an experimental and/or visual poem</li>\n<li>a sonnet / fixed-form poem</li>\n<li>a prose poem</li>\n<li>a haiku.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: You are not expected to write a fully polished and \"finished\" poem; this is about engaging with lecture content, learning and practicing specific methods of poetic expression.</p>\n<p>At the end of semester, the <strong>highest three marks out of five</strong> will be counted. The weighting of each mark is 10% (<strong>30% total</strong>).</p>\n<p>If you miss 1 or 2 assessed poetry-writing exercises, this is acceptable.</p>\n<p>If you are absent from an assessed writing session, <strong>a mark of 0</strong> will be awarded automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>As this is in internal course, you must make yourself available to undertake these exercises at the scheduled date, time and venue. Please see <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=203\">Exam Procedures</a> for full information. </p>\n<p>These are<strong> handwritten</strong>, <strong>closed-book</strong> writing sessions. No written material, electronic material or electronic devices can be used. All such items should remain in your bag or under your desk. All electronic items must be switched off or in airplane mode. Where a device emits any noise, you may be subject to allegations of misconduct and the items may be confiscated for the duration of the quiz. You will be permitted to bring suitable writing implements, water in a clear bottle, and ear plugs (not ear buds or headphones). </p>\n<p>You must turn up to <strong>your allocated tutorial</strong>, as per Allocate+.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Please note that there are </em><strong><em>NO</em></strong> <em>opportunities to re-take individual writing exercises, and no alternative assessment available, except in the very specific circumstances. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a <strong>Student Action Plan (SAPD)</strong> that applies to the writing exercise (and you’ve not received a reply following submission of your action plan), please contact me immediately. We can make accommodations for some of the issues documented in Student Action Plans (e.g., if you cannot handwrite).</p>\n<p>If you have a genuine, <strong>documented</strong> reason you have been unable to attend the tutorials <strong>on three or more occasions</strong>, a make-up session will be offered later in the semester. Reasons may include: sudden/serious illness that requires a lengthy absence; or another documented reason for a lengthy absence.</p>\n<p>There is already flexibility built into this assessment to miss up to two tutorials, so the make-up session does not apply to students who miss tutorials due short-term illness, work commitments, etc.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for alternative assessment, you must contact me by <strong>Week 5</strong> with your documentation. If there is an unforeseeable change to your circumstances (e.g. illness, new job) after that date, please contact me as soon as you can with documentation.</p>\n<p>There will be <em>one</em> make up test session offered in which you'll complete three different writing exercises over a period of 120 minutes. It will take place in week 13, so please ensure you're available.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
