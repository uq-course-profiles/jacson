You will also need to refer to content from a minimum of <strong>three</strong> online sources about strategic communication or related fields (e.g., online sources related advertising, public relations, marketing, organizational communication, case studies, company websites) to provide examples/evidence for your arguments.</p>\n<p>In your literature review, you will need to answer the following questions</p>\n<p>1) What is strategic communication?</p>\n<p>2) What are the differences and similarities between strategic communication and public relations, integrated marketing communications, and advertising? </p>\n<p>3) From a strategic communication perspective, what are the most significant challenges and opportunities for the organization in the scenario. What should be your organization’s strategic (not tactical) priority in addressing the communication problem described in your scenario?</p>\n<p>In your answers, reference/cite the resources you used. Please avoid a simplistic reproduction of the material in the seminar slides (you may use them as a guide). You are expected to consult original sources to build your own review.
