We strongly recommend you attend all tutorials, because this is where you will learn core skills in literary studies, engage in rich conversations about books and ideas, and develop peer review skills. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Participation involves completing the readings before tutorials, being engaged in discussions, completing the tasks at hand and discussing them with peers, asking questions, and working with your colleagues in small and large groups. It also involves encouraging your colleagues to engage and to develop their ideas. Students are required to participate for the full duration of the tutorial.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Consistent preparation and participation lead to better learning outcomes and more productive and enjoyable learning experiences. Through participation, humanities students gain highly valued and distinctive skills in critical thinking, discipline mastery, evidence-based learning, creativity, and collaboration. These skills are required by many workplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation: </strong>Because of our focus on reading and analysis, we expect you will come to tutorials well-prepared i.e. having read the set primary and secondary texts and developed some ideas and questions. You can also use the <strong>weekly Reading Guides</strong> (in each week's Learning Resources) to prepare for class. This will ensure you are individually prepared and ready to contribute to class discussion, and will ensure your tutorials are valuable learning experiences. </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: By attending tutorials and actively engaging with the week's work, you can earn <strong>up to 15% towards your final grade. </strong>This provides your tutor with a chance to identify any problems you may be having in the course, and provide basic, regular feedback. <strong>From Week 1 onwards, participating in a tutorial by completing the week's reading log entry (an in-class assessment task) will earn you 1 mark</strong>, <strong>and submitting and participating in a research essay plan workshop in the Week 10 tutorial will earn you up to 5 marks.</strong></p>\n<p>In tutorials, you will complete a 10-minute reading log task based on the week's Reading Guide questions. Your reading log entry should be 100-150 words (not including the question you are responding to) and take the form of a critical reflection on your reading of the week's texts. We will demonstrate how to submit these in our early lectures and tutorials. For practical tips on how to write reading log entries (also known as reflective journal entries) and other writing formats, see <a href=\"https://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/learning/types-of-assignments\">Student Services learning types of assignments</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How are my reading log entries marked? </strong>Reading logs are marked Pass / Fail on the Marking Criteria by your tutor.</p>\n<p><strong>How will I receive feedback? </strong>You will be provided with individual feedback on your reading log entry during the first weeks of the semester. Tutors will provide group feedback during tutorials, as your responses will show us what the key issues are for each class.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong>: This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
