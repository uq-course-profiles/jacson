Your pitch must also outline the formats you will use to share your high-quality content.</p>\n<p> Ultimately, your pitch should demonstrate how you will use your workplace-transferrable skills in planning, research, organisation of data, communication, and digital literacy acquired and/or developed through studying Ancient History at UQ and in ANCH3580 to bring the project to completion.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Further information will be available on Blackboard under the Assessment Tab and will be discussed in class, including the type of AI use that is potentially useful, and that which should be avoided.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to engage critically in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
