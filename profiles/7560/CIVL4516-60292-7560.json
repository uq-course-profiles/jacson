The logbook should contain design development (calculations and sketches or notes to electronic files used to do these), project management details (meeting minutes, Gantt charts etc) and <strong>a summary of <em>actual</em> progress in the previous week</strong>. It can be either paper or electronic.</p>\n<p>The logbook may be reviewed by course coordinator or their delegate during the semester. These maybe unannounced, so students should always ensure that their logbooks are maintained to a high standard.</p>\n<p>Your logbook must be available for inspection and assessment by course coordinator or their delegate at <strong><em>any time</em></strong> in Weeks 2 through 13.</p>\n<p>If there is a disagreement within your team with regard to PAFs, your logbook may be taken into consideration when applying the outcomes of the peer assessment process to determine your result for the team reports.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
