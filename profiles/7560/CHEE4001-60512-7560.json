A Block Flow Diagram for selected process with input-output diagrams for each student's section of the plant.</p>\n<p>The audience will ask questions that require you to justify the decisions you have made and recommendations you have reached.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

Tasks in Design Package 1 include Team Project Outputs, Individual - Core, and Individual - Advanced tasks as listed in the table below.</p>\n<p>These Team Project Outputs (T-PO) design tasks define the problem and project scope, reviews available options, and presents an appropriate process concept design with block flow diagrams and input/output diagrams for each section of the plant to be designed by team members. The process concept design needs to be supported by relevant material and energy balances, and a simple economic analysis performed. The team must identify major hazards associated with the proposed process. A statement about the potential impacts (both positive and negative) of the proposed process development should also be included.</p>\n<p>Each student must also submit the three I-Core design tasks in DP1 to demonstrate satisfactory competencies in core chemical engineering skills. To achieve a Grade of 4 or 5 in the course you don’t need to complete any I-Adv tasks. If you are targeting a Grade of 6 or 7 you may choose up to one I-Adv design task in Design Package 1.

Each team watching a session will score the other teams presentations – this peer assessment is also a team activity and your team leader must submit your evaluations to the teaching staff member when you leave the presentation session. The mentors and course coordinator will consider the peer marks in awarding the final presentation mark.</p>\n<p>All team members will receive the same mark unless there are exceptional circumstances where an individual did not contribute.</p>\n<p>Penalty for not completing peer assessment:</p>\n<p>If your team doesn't submit peer assessments for the other team in your session, your team will have 2 points (from 10 points) deducted from your Final Presentation score.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to attend the Final Presentation at the scheduled time, please submit a request for extension as per UQ policy for <a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension?p=0#0.\">Applying for Extension</a>.
