            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>In this learning activity you will play the role of a Student Audiologist on placement in the University of Queensland Audiology Clinic (UQAC). You will consider the case of a 6-week-old child for whom you have just completed an audiological follow-up assessment. This follow-up assessment included a case history, ABR, high-frequency tympanometry, and DPOAE testing.</p>\n<p>Your task for the case study assessment is to <strong>write three (3) documents:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>An audiological report. </strong>Your audiological report is to be addressed to the child’s Family Doctor. It must include pre-amble, case history, results, impressions, and recommendations, and be written with the target reader in mind. There is no word limit for this report, although its length should reflect the need for clear and concise writing in audiology reports.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>A letter presenting your management plan for the child.</strong> Your letter is to be addressed to the child’s parents. It must include pre-amble, introduction, body, and conclusion, and be written with the target readers in mind. There is no word limit for this letter, although its length should reflect the need for clear and concise writing when communicating with parents. As this letter is to be addressed to the child’s parents/caregivers, it must <em>not</em> include formal referencing (e.g., in-text citations and a reference list), <em>can</em> include informal referencing (e.g., web page addresses) if desired, and <em>must</em> indicate where artificial intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning (ML) was used (if it was used).</p>\n<p>Your management plan must include <em>how</em> the parents could action your plan. For example, if you suggest the parents seek a hearing aid fitting for their child, then you need to include <em>how</em> they could do this given where they live, the services available to them, how hearing loss in children is managed in that part of Australia, etc.</p>\n<p>When preparing your management plan, you may wish to review:</p>\n<p>- The introductory lecture for AUDL7223 and its content on preparing for the complex paediatric client/patient and management plans in the health sciences.</p>\n<p>- The content of <em>AUDL7123 Paediatric Audiology I</em> and <em>AUDL7213 Paediatric Audiology II</em>.</p>\n<p>- The content of other <em>AUDL</em> courses relevant to your case study report.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>A critical essay justifying your management plan.</strong> Your critical essay is to be presented in academic style. It must include an introduction, body, conclusion in a standard, academic format, and referencing (in-text citations and a reference list including for AI/ML use [if used]) in American Psychological Association format, version 7 (APA 7th).</p>\n<p>In your essay, you must use the professional and scientific literature to justify your management plan for the child. For example, if you recommended the child undergo a hearing aid fitting, what scientific and professional literature can you offer to argue that this was an evidenced-based recommendation (and not just your or somebody else’s opinion). More developed arguments could include type of hearing aid/s recommended and why, fitting method recommended and why, etc.</p>\n<p>The maximum word-count allowed for the essay is 1000 including all words in the introduction, body and conclusion and appendices (if used). This count includes words in the in-text citations but not words in the essay title or reference list. You will be penalised an absolute value of 10% for the whole case study if you exceed this word limit (for example, if you scored 80% for the whole case study, but your word count for your essay was 1001, then your score for the whole case study would be reduced to 70%).</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
