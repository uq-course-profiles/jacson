The project defense is intended to assess the student's genuine understanding of their research project and their ability to communicate their work clearly and confidently. During the defense, the student is expected to give a concise summary of the project's objectives, methodology, and findings, and to respond thoughtfully to questions from the examiner regarding the project's background, approach, results, and significance. The defense also provides an opportunity to clarify the student's individual contribution and confirm their comprehension of key concepts, methods, and literature relevant to the project. The student should be prepared to discuss alternative approaches, justify their choices, and reflect on the limitations and implications of their work. Overall, the defense is an important part of the assessment process to ensure academic integrity and to verify that the report reflects the student's own understanding and effort.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
