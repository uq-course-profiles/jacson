Students will be asked to justify their unique translation decisions during their W6 one-on-one interview with the Lecturer.</li>\n<li>Submit translation annotations that demonstrate sensitivity towards both the source text and the target text, including the ability to 'read between the lines.'

Note that any written contributions that contain only general observations will not qualify for a mark; it is the student's responsibility to ensure that written tasks convince the reader that they are based on and drawn from the student's own personal experiences.

Students are expected to draw on their weekly portfolio entries (W2-5) to articulate what they have learned, how they responded to challenges, and how their experiences have informed their understanding of professional practice. The interview also serves as a checkpoint to support academic integrity by confirming the authenticity of the submitted work.</p>\n<p>The one-on-one interviews do not carry a separate weighting but instead function as academic integrity hurdle requirements (PASS/FAIL). <em>While the interview is not weighted, it will be assessed against specific criteria. Guidelines and marking criteria will be made available to students via Blackboard.</em></p>\n<p>Each interview will take approximately <strong>10 minutes</strong> and will be scheduled outside of regular class time.

Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
