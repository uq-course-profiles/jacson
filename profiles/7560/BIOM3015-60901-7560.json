In this report you must address the following: (1) Give a brief description of the anatomy and typical physiology of the organ and body system chosen. You may like to include a sketch/schematic (200 words) (2) Describe the anatomy of the abnormal specimen examined in the IPLC (100 words) (3) Explain the pathophysiology of the disease state examined in relation to the anatomical features observed (200 words) (4) Detail how disease pathophysiology in this organ might influence other body systems (300 words) This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
