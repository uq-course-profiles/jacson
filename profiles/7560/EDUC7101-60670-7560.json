It is designed to foster an in-depth inquiry into the circumstances which influence change processes. This will be done by contextualising educational change through a critical literature review. (1) You must choose, as a minimum, one of the required readings to begin your paper then (2) review two readings that this paper has cited, then (3) review two papers that have cited the chosen course reading. You must frame your review of all these papers through your experiences with/in educational change.</p>\n<p>Use the following question to provide a focus for your essay:</p>\n<p>How have “global” political and policy trends influenced educational change processes in your context (or in one that you are familiar with) in recent times?</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You will need to analyse these comments in light of relevant literature covered in the course and related material as part of your wider reading.</p>\n<p>The final assignment should include the following sections (word limits are indicative only):</p>\n<p><strong>i.</strong> Introduction (approximately 300 words)</p>\n<p>In the introduction, describe the change initiative and why it was introduced. Provide sufficient contextual material to ensure it is readily understandable to a reader without experience of the particular case.</p>\n<p><strong>ii.</strong> Analysis (approximately 2,500 words)</p>\n<p>The analysis section is the principal part of the assignment. In the analysis, present and interpret the educators’ responses in light of relevant literature. The subject provides considerable relevant literature, and this should be used and supplemented with other relevant sources.</p>\n<p><strong>iii.</strong> Conclusion (approximately 200 words)</p>\n<p>The conclusion summarises the main findings of the study and makes an assessment of the educational change in light of the educators’ responses and relevant literature.</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p><strong>Task Option B</strong></p>\n<p>As for task option A, but based on a discussion with two (2) principals/senior administrators rather than three to five educators.</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p><strong>Task Option C</strong></p>\n<p>Develop your own topic in conjunction with the lecturer. The topic must reflect the aims of the course, have a research component, and be conducive to the application of readings from the course, as well as relevant supplementary materials.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
