Each student will be responsible for one clearly defined component of the report. As a group, students will interpret sensory data, propose an appropriate sensory evaluation method, design a session framework, address methodological and ethical considerations, and combine findings in a structured report. The task integrates theoretical knowledge with applied scientific reasoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Details of the Case Study</strong></p>\n<p>This is group work. Each group comprising four students (self-selected using the course Blackboard site) will investigate a sensory evaluation case study assigned to them. From teaching weeks 1 to 7, each group will come together, discuss the case study, analyse and interpret the sensory data, and consult associated reading materials, library databases, books, and original research papers to collate relevant information and submit the critically discussed case study through Turnitin. Since this is group work, individual contributions to teamwork will be evaluated by each group member for the other three. I will be available to answer questions and guide your group during the sensory practical sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>The critically discussed case study [(Font: Arial, Font Size 12, Line spacing: 1.5), maximum of 6000 ± 10% words excludes Title Page, References, Figures.

These tutorials are designed to provide practical, hands-on experience in analyzing sensory and physical assessment data, enabling participants to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. The structured sessions will cover various aspects of data analysis, from basic functionalities to advanced software features, ensuring a comprehensive understanding.</p>\n<p>All tutorial sessions will be recorded to accommodate different learning styles and schedules. These recordings will be made available on the course Blackboard site, allowing participants to review the material at their convenience. This ensures that everyone has the opportunity to fully grasp the content, even if they are unable to attend the live sessions. The availability of these recordings also serves as a valuable resource for revisiting complex topics and reinforcing learning throughout the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Details:</strong></p>\n<p>The assessment will be <strong>In-Class Online</strong>, where participants will solve problems based on the tutorial content using the Jamovi software. The assessment covers key sensory data analysis techniques using Jamovi, including descriptive statistics, visualisation (e.g., boxplots, bar charts), and ANOVA methods (One-Way, Two-Way, and Repeated Measures). Non-parametric tests such as Friedman are also introduced. This component is essential and contributes 20% to the overall course marks.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking: </strong>Refer to the Course Blackboard Site.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
