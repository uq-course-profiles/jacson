For full details, including the marking rubric, please refer to the course Learn UQ (Blackboard) site.</p>\n<p>The assessment consists of two parts, each worth 25% of your final grade for this assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: Group Workshop</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Weighting: </strong>25% </p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>In the tutorials from <strong>Week 4 </strong>(22 August) to <strong>Week 7</strong> (12 September), students will work in groups (4 students) to facilitate one of four community work practice skills workshops. The aim of this group task is to demonstrate the ability to define, analyse and apply direct practice skills in group work and community work. </p>\n<p><strong>Group Allocations:</strong> We will be organising group membership, topics and the presentation schedule in our first tutorial. Please ensure that you attend this class. If you are unable to attend, you will be placed in a group and provided the contact details of your group members. It is your responsibility to make contact with your group as soon as possible following receipt of those details.</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial Participation Requirement: </strong>If a student is unable to attend and participate in the Week 4 - Week 7 tutorials due to illness or an unexpected personal crisis, they will be required to complete a catch-up group work activity (e.g. facilitating a group activity in a tutorial). This ensures that all students meet the learning outcomes required by Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) accreditation standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Individual Reflection</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Weighting: </strong>25%</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Students will undertake a reflective analysis to deepen their understanding of community work practice. For this task, students will write an<em> </em><strong>(individual) reflection </strong>where they critically analyse and apply the principles of<strong> </strong>community education/problem-posing drawing on their experience of facilitating the group workshop and the experience of participating as a group member in at least one other group workshop. To support their individual reflection, students will have the opportunity in the tutorials to journal their learning experiences following each of the group workshops. These reflective journal entries will support this Part 2 of the assessment. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. While students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools. Please complete the reflective statement on how AI was used in this assessment taking into account ethical considerations.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
