Students are to prepare a report that compares and contrasts the use of robotics (automated technology) with traditional practices/methods for a contemporary challenge related to a task/process. To complete this assignment, you may find it useful to first explore the definition of robotics (automated technology) and how to effectively write using ‘compare and contrast’, then select a horticulture industry of your choice (e.g., nursery, floriculture, vegetables or fruit) and for a particular enterprise (e.g., stone fruit orchard, hydroponic strawberry farm), research a production task/process where robotics (automated technology) could be used to overcome a contemporary problem.</p>\n<p>Note, selecting a production task/process where robotics (automated technology) are <strong>not</strong> already commonly used will demonstrate a higher level of critical thinking. For example, equipment that is used to sort individual fruit by weight and colour are commonly used in packing sheds, however, you may find equipment designed for packing lines with new capabilities that enhance shelf life and would be appropriate for this assignment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Guide for preparing the report</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Outline your chosen horticulture industry and the importance/purpose of the task/process you have selected. Explain the traditional practice/methods for the horticulture task/process you have chosen, including the contemporary challenge(s), and the robotics (automated technology) that could be used to solve the problem. (200 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Body</strong></p>\n<p>Compare and contrast traditional methods and the use of robotics (automated technology) for your chosen horticultural task/process. Ensure that you include scientific, plant/crop physiology, literature when comparing the differences and similarities. For example, if your task is pruning fruit trees, you would include the scientific reason for how much wood to remove and from where. (1200 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Restate the importance/purpose of the horticulture task and the challenge that could be solved by using robotics (automated technology). Summarise several key points resulting from the compare and contrast process.
