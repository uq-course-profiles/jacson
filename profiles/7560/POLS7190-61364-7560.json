Marks will be accrued in seminars from week 3 to week 13 - you can  build your contributions over the semester per the criteria spelt out in the criteria sheet. You should aim to participate in seminar discussions by engaging with a) at least one of the required readings, b) the class discussion (comments in interpretations of your colleagues and course staff) and c) one of the course learning objectives (see Section 5 in this document).</p>\n<p>Please note that this assessment item is not asking you to demonstrate your knowledge, but to reflect upon how you are coming to know. Appropriate self-analysis and critique are crucial for this task. Consider, for instance, that our relationship with our knowing can be emotional. Learning may be challenging, confronting, affirming, disarming, surprising, frustrating. You should aim to openly discuss these and other experiences in engaging with the topic (including readings and pre-recorded videos) and link that with your experience of learning.</p>\n<p>If a medical or other circumstance leads to challenges for you completing this assessment item, please contact the course coordinator directly.</p>\n<p>Please Note:</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in person.

It is common for people to believe that they can simply ‘talk’ without having a plan or a script, but this rarely works well.</li>\n<li>Do not aim for perfection. It can be tempting to try re-recording to eliminate errors, but it is natural that your video recording has some minor errors in it (you do not need to produce a newsreader or studio quality video).</li>\n<li>Observe the video length limit (10% under or over is fine).</li>\n<li>Begin your video by stating: \"My name is [XX] and this is my [insert first, second, etc,] video reflection.\"</li>\n<li>See the criteria sheet for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
