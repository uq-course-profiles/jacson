Students will also be tested to 'think on their feet,' based on scenarios similar to those in industry. Points will be provided for content, delivery, and individual students' contributions to the group work. </p>\n<p>This is your opportunity to show your creativity, backed by evidence or best practices. It is expected that each member of the peer group will sustain a strong level of team engagement, show respect for the opinions/input of others into decision-making, demonstrate a willingness to take on responsibilities and complete this on time, and adopt a collaborative approach (working well with all team members - avoiding passivity, submissiveness, or domination). </p>\n<p>Following the presentation, each student will upload the campaign plan and portfolio component of this assessment, along with a short note reflecting on their learning outcomes and contribution to group work. </p>\n<p><strong>Student use of AI/MT in assessments </strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
