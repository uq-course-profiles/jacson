For this essay, you can select one of two options as set out below. Each option requires you to write a formal essay, with a clear topic focus, paragraph structure, references (footnotes or endnotes are preferred) and a bibliography of sources consulted. </p>\n<p><strong>Firstly,</strong> you can develop your essay as a document study. If you take this option, you should identify and analyse three primary sources (apart from those supplied in the course readings) that provide an insight into one of the key topics in the course. Your sources could be memoirs, governmental reports, contemporary newspaper accounts, contemporary published books, or diaries and private correspondence. These can be of any length, preferably no more than 4-5 pages each. Important: please submit scans of the sources used as part of your submitted essay, or alternatively email them separately to the course co-ordinator. Suitable primary sources can be located using the online research databases maintained by the UQ Library, one of the many various bibliographies in British history, or by following up the footnotes in the major texts and suggested readings. </p>\n<p><em>In your essay, identify and discuss key themes and insights that are raised by the sources either separately or as a group. What is their value as historical evidence? Quote directly from the sources themselves, and provide full references to them in the bibliography, as well as any secondary sources you have used (a minimum of 3-5 is recommended).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Secondly,</strong> your essay could examine a major historical novel or piece of non-fiction, satire, or polemic. Your chosen text should be written in the period 1700-1950, and should deal with social, political or cultural events of that era in Britain. Suggested authors: Defoe, Swift, Richardson, Burke, Wollstonecraft, Austen, the Bronte sisters, Thackeray, Disraeli, Dickens, Eliot, Trollope, Carlyle, Gaskell, Ruskin, Hardy, Wells, Wilde, Woolf, Galsworthy, Orwell, and of course many others. Secondary sources and critical texts will be useful in developing your analysis.</p>\n<p><em>Discuss the text as a historical document in its appropriate context (social, intellectual, political or biographical). What historical themes or topics does it engage with, and how (or why)? What does it contribute to historical knowledge? </em></p>\n<p><strong>Word Limits:</strong> A word count that is within ±10% of the set length (1,000 words) is acceptable. Word count does not include bibliography or footnotes; however, discursive footnotes are included in the word count. A word count that is outside these 10% will receive a proportionate penalty and will be graded against the grading criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>AI:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
