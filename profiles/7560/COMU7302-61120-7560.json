Students will also be tested to 'think on their feet' to address alternative crisis scenarios. Points will be provided for both content and delivery, and individual students' contributions to the group work. </p>\n<p>The presentation will provide an overview of the crisis and critically examine the organisation's responses and their impact on media coverage and stakeholder responses. Finally, it will offer key recommendations on communicating more effectively in future crises.</p>\n<p>Students should use a mix of scholarly references, media coverage, and organisational materials. The student presentations will occur in tutorials.
