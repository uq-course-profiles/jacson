Individual exam essays and other exam questions are not awarded grades, but are assessed numerically (such as a mark out of five, or a mark out of ten). The overall grade achieved for an exam is arrived at by totalling the marks for the constituent elements of the exam.</p>\n<p> To achieve a grade of 7 (High Distinction, 85-100%), your exam will demonstrate an exceptional grasp of terminology, factual knowledge, themes and ideas. You will demonstrate an exceptional level of understanding and rigour in argumentation in responding to short and long answer prompts, showing exceptional clarity of ideas, understanding of issues, organisation of material, and insightful and creative responses. Your responses will be directly relevant to the prompts. The written expression and presentation will be excellent and follow discipline conventions.</p>\n<p> To achieve a grade of 6 (Distinction, 75-84%), your exam will demonstrate an advanced grasp of terminology, factual knowledge, themes and ideas. You will demonstrate a very good level of understanding and rigour in argumentation in responding to short and long answer prompts, showing very good understanding of issues, organisation of material, and a capable synthesis of ideas. Your responses will be directly relevant to the prompts. The written expression and presentation will be very good and follow discipline conventions.</p>\n<p> To achieve a grade of 5 (Credit, 65 – 74%), your exam will demonstrate a proficient grasp of terminology, factual knowledge, themes and ideas. You will demonstrate a good understanding and rigour in argumentation in responding to short and long answer prompts, showing good understanding of issues, good organisation of material, and a generally capable synthesis of ideas. Your responses will be indirectly relevant to the prompts. The written expression and presentation will be good and largely follow discipline conventions.</p>\n<p> To achieve a grade of 4 (Pass, 50 – 64%), your exam will demonstrate a basic grasp of terminology, factual knowledge, themes and ideas. You will demonstrate a basic understanding and rigour in argumentation in responding to short and long answer prompts, showing a basic understanding of issues and adequate organisation of material. Your responses will be indirectly relevant to the prompts with unclear links between the prompts and your answer. Your written expression and presentation will be satisfactory and follow discipline conventions. </p>\n<p> To achieve a grade of 3 (Marginal Fail, 45 – 49%), your exam will demonstrate an emerging grasp of terminology and factual knowledge that is underdeveloped and falling short of a pass. You will demonstrate a superficial and inadequate understanding in your responses to short and long answer prompts, showing poor argumentation and poor organisation. Your responses will be indirectly relevant to the prompts with unclear links between the prompts and your answer, offering tangential or unrelated information. Your written expression and presentation will be adequate and should attempt to follow discipline conventions. </p>\n<p> To achieve a grade of 2 (Fail, 25-44%), your exam will demonstrate a limited or partial grasp of terminology and factual knowledge that is deficient and incomplete. Your responses to short and long answer prompts will show a deficient understanding with no attempt engage meaningfully with the prompts. You demonstrate overall deficiencies in fundamental aspects of this course through limited or poor organisation and explanations. Your responses will be unrelated to the prompts, answering only vaguely or tangentially to the prompt. Your writing will be poor and/or inappropriate, and will not follow discipline conventions.</p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 1 (Low Fail, 0-24%), your exam essay will demonstrate that you have failed to meet the minimum learning requirements and skill acquisition for this assessment task. You will have demonstrate little grasp of terminology or factual knowledge. Your responses to short and long answer prompts will demonstrate that you have inadequately understood fundamental aspects of this course. Your responses will be unrelated to the prompts. Your writing will be poorly organised and/or poorly written, and will not follow discipline conventions.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
