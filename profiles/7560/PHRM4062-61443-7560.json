The key component of reflection is ensuring the creation of a specific plan to aid learning within the scope of the situation, and describing how this action is being undertaken.</p>\n<p><strong>Each reflection should not exceed 500 words. More information and marking rubrics for the SEAL reflections can be found on Learn.UQ (Blackboard) on the Assessment page.</strong> </p>\n<p>Students should consider their individual experiences during their Placement in order to reflect effectively within each of the different schemas described below: </p>\n<p><strong>1. National Competency Standards (NCS) schema:</strong> Please read the relevant <strong><em>National Competency Standards (NCS) Framework for Pharmacists in Australia 2016</em></strong> (as available through the course Blackboard site) and familiarise yourself with the Standards before attending your placement. Students are to reflect on ONE chosen Enabling Competency from the NCS in each reflection. Each selected Enabling Competency should be different from the others. Students should reflect on the level of skills, knowledge or professional attributes they acquired/demonstrated during their placement experience and relate this clearly to the chosen Enabling Competency. Students are also encouraged to reflect on their own unique personal experiences (e.g. feelings, personal attributes, individual strengths/weaknesses at this stage of development, etc). </p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Lifelong Learning (LLL) schema</strong>: Students should reflect on their own future learning needs and how they have used feedback to inform their ongoing development, which will enable them to professionally manage their internship and joining the pharmacy profession. They should focus on how their placement uncovered specific elements of their own practice and learning that they consider to be particularly relevant to their future practice, and for becoming a lifelong learner who will remain committed to their continuing professional development. </p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Employability schema</strong>: Employability can be defined as a “<em>set of capabilities and personal attributes that empower graduates to perform effectively in the workplace, generate opportunities, and create positive social and economic impact”</em>. This Employability Reflection is an opportunity for students to reflect on their own personal experiences in relation to any aspects of their individual employability at this late stage of their student career path. It is strongly recommended that students familiarise themselves with, before the placement, the UQ’s Employability Framework for necessary background information on the meaning, definitions, structure, and relevant considerations in preparation for addressing this assessment item: https://employability.uq.edu.au/about/employability-framework. </p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools may be used appropriately to support students in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly acknowledge any use of AI in each instance.

If the placement includes a public holiday relevant to that placement site, the students are expected to attend/not attend the placement site in accordance with usual practice at that site e.g. if the facility is not open during the public holiday, then the students do not attend and that time is included within the 180 hours. </li>\n<li>In the case of illness, students are NOT expected to attend their placement and should inform their preceptor. Absences should be recorded in InPlace within 24 hours of your absence (<a href=\"https://uq.pressbooks.pub/bachelor-pharmacy-placement-handbook/chapter/record-an-absence-in-inplace/\">instructions here</a>). Students away from their placement site for greater than TWO days due to illness (i.e. on the third day) should obtain a medical certificate and provide this to the School Office and their preceptor. </li>\n<li>Students are advised to contact the Course Coordinator to notify of any prolonged absence (greater than THREE days) from the placement site due to illness. Additionally, irrespective of medical certificates, any cumulative absence over the 6-week period longer than 3 days must be immediately brought to the attention of the Course Coordinator. </li>\n<li>All students are expected to be available to commence classes in other Year 4 courses in Week 5 of semester. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ENTRUSTABLE PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES (EPAs)</strong>  </p>\n<p>Evidence of entrustment discussions with your preceptor during placement and final entrustment decision at the end of your placement should be completed via the ePortfolio. Students will choose a minimum of <strong>THREE (3)</strong> EPAs from a suite of EPAs provided that are relevant to the placement site and the students’ learning goals. Students are required to submit a statement of justification for their choice of EPAs with their EPA self-assessment. See the Learn.UQ (Blackboard) site for more information regarding the EPAs.</p>\n<p><strong>EPA REFLECTION and INDIVIDUAL LEARNING PLAN (ILP)</strong> </p>\n<p>After the placement period is complete, students are required to complete their Reflection and Individual Learning Plan (ILP) for submission via the ePortfolio, based on the feedback they have received from their preceptor or other colleagues at the placement site, the entrustment levels assigned for each EPA undertaken and the action plan discussed during the final feedback session with the preceptor. See Learn.UQ (Blackboard) for more information and marking criteria. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Student Reflection:</strong> This can be uploaded as a WORD.doc file in the ePortfolio. The maximum word count for the student reflection is 500 words. Students can use the SEAL template of reflection if they wish, but can also follow a more generalised structure to reflect on their overall experience in undertaking the chosen EPAs during their placement. It is important for students to focus on their learnings, linking actions to their future development. Students can include references or attachments where necessary/appropriate to support their reflection.</li>\n<li><strong>Individual Learning Plan (ILP):</strong> The ePortfolio provides clear instructions and a template for students to complete their ILP based on their performance in undertaking the EPAs and feedback from their preceptor during their placement.
