For this task, you need to find a dataset consisting of at least 3 columns of which at least one must contain numeric values. You then need to record a <strong>10-minute presentation </strong>in which you describe, summarise, and visualise the dataset. In addition, you need to motivate and formulate at least one research question that you could answer based on the dataset. The motivation for answering the research question should be based on a gap in the existing body of research. Finally, we want you to elaborate on how you would proceed to answer, in detail, the research question (be specific!).</p>\n<p>Below, you will find some pointers on what questions should be answered in your presentation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Source</strong>: where does the data come from or how was it compiled?</li>\n<li><strong>Overview</strong>: What variables does the data set consist of and what do the variables represent? How many observations does the dataset contain?</li>\n<li><strong>Variables</strong>: What are the levels of categorical variables? What are mean, standard deviation, range, etc. of numeric variables?</li>\n<li><strong>Distributions</strong>: What are the distributions of the variables in the data set? (you can use tables and visualisations to address this)</li>\n<li><strong>Research question</strong>: What is a research question, that extends existing research, could be answered based on this dataset?</li>\n<li><strong>Possible research</strong>: How would one have to proceed to answer the research question based on the dataset?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prepare slides for your presentation and record yourself and the slides (we suggest you use Zoom and share your screen). The entire presentation should be between 9 and a maximum of 11 minutes (recordings must not be longer than 11 minutes). Your answers should be presented as a coherent, clear, logical, and engaging manner. Any sources and citations mentioned in your presentation need to be added in a reference list at the end of your presentation (which should also be formatted according to APA7).</p>\n<p>Your slides and your presentation should be engaging and informative. Your slides should not be too text heavy, and the slides should contain the main aspects of what you say/present. Use appropriate language without errors both on the slides and in your presentation. You are welcome to use visualisations and tables created by yourself and/or from the articles. Your face needs to be visible during the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement on Gen AI &amp; MT</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It offers an opportunity to engage with a real-world, language- or culture-related data set chosen by the student, honing your abilities to describe, summarise, visualise, and quantitatively analyse data. By undertaking this assessment, you will gain insights into the approaches and practices employed by data analysts in the field.</p>\n<p>For the Statistical Analysis Report, you are required to write a concise report, limited to 2000 words (excluding R code, R output, and references). It is crucial that you also include the R code you use in the analysis. The report should encompass the following key aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Motivation and Research Question: Begin by providing a clear rationale for your research question, explaining its significance and relevance to the field of study.</li>\n<li>Hypothesis Formulation: Develop a hypothesis that corresponds to your research question, demonstrating a hypothesis-driven approach to your analysis.</li>\n<li>Data Description, Tabulation, and Visualisation: Thoroughly describe the dataset utilised in your analysis, employing appropriate tables, figures, and visualisations to present the data in a comprehensive manner.</li>\n<li>Statistical Analysis Description: Describe the statistical techniques and methods employed to analyse the data. Provide a detailed explanation of the chosen approaches, justifying their relevance to the research question.</li>\n<li>Results Reporting: Present the results of your analysis using a combination of prose, tables, and figures. Ensure that your findings are clear, concise, and effectively support your hypothesis.</li>\n<li>Critical Evaluation: Conduct a critical evaluation of your analysis, highlighting any potential issues or limitations that may impact the validity or generalisability of your results. Offer thoughtful insights into how these shortcomings could be addressed or mitigated.</li>\n<li>References: Include a reference section following APA7 format, acknowledging any external sources used in your report.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By completing the Statistical Analysis Report, you will demonstrate your proficiency in data analysis, hypothesis formulation, result interpretation, and critical evaluation.
