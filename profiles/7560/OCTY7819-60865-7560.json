            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Students will participate in and present peer-led seminars that commence in week 3. Students will undertake each of three roles throughout the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Presenting Team Role</strong></p>\n<p> Seminars will be developed and presented in teams of 5 or 6 (depending on overall student numbers). Teams can include students across OCTY4206 and OCTY7819. There will be a total of 11 teams in each seminar stream (Stream A and B) - i.e. 22 teams in total. Students are required to present a professional standard learning-focused seminar to their peers. These seminars are for 1 hour and 45 minutes (including a 15-minute break) and will occur during the scheduled time for seminars. The purpose of these seminars is to provide students in the presenting team with an opportunity to learn and practice the skills required for planning and presenting professional information to colleagues and engaging them in professional learning activities. Topics and dates will be allocated using a preference process and advised in week 1 of the semester. These topic allocations will include allocation to either seminar series A or B (which are scheduled at the same time) and students will remain in that seminar series for the whole of the semester.</p>\n<p>* Presenting teams should provide a professional-standard handout for audience members. These handouts should be approximately 6 pages. Presenting teams are required to provide a pdf of their handout to their stream mentor (staff member) 48 hours before their scheduled seminar, so they can be made available through Blackboard. Presenting teams are encouraged to use and refer to these handouts throughout the seminar.</p>\n<p>* Presenting teams should provide a PDF copy of their presentation (e.g., powerpoint, Canva etc) to their stream mentor (staff member) 24 hours before their scheduled seminar. </p>\n<p>* Presenting teams will meet in the time allocated on the timetable (or as negotiated) with their stream mentor (staff member) 2 university weeks before the scheduled date.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Support Team Role</strong></p>\n<p>As with continuing professional education events, these seminars will include a <strong>registration desk</strong> and <strong>break for refreshment</strong> (of 15 minutes). The student team that presented the preceding week will undertake the role of Support Team (i.e., students presenting in week 13 will be the support team in week 3, and students who presented in week 3 will be the support team in week 4, and so forth). These student teams will: a) provide simple refreshments for the break, b) operate \"registration\" of attendees in the style of a registration desk at a CPD event, and c) generally provide support to the presenting group regarding setting up for the seminar. The breaks during the seminar will provide an opportunity for networking among student colleagues. <strong>Please note:</strong> Regarding the refreshment break, the purpose of this is to provide a break in the seminar for networking and socialising. There is no course budget for this and there is no expectation for the supporting team to provide more than a minimal snack. No liquids should be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Seminar Participant Role</strong></p>\n<p>Supporting other staff is a professional skill expected of occupational therapists. To provide support to other students leading professional seminars, students are expected to attend and participate in peer-led seminars. Students are expected to register their attendance at the registration desk.</p>\n<p>* Students who are unable to attend a seminar should email the stream mentor (staff member) and the course coordinator. Students who are unable to attend are required to submit a 500 word summary of the missed seminar, based on the handout and conversations with attendees. Links for submission of these are on UQ.learn.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Note: <strong>The presentation will be recorded.</strong></p>\n<p>When a student is required to complete an oral or practical assessment item worth 20% or more, the performance will be recorded and retained per <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=184\">Appendix 1</a>, <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=184\">Assessment Procedure (95)</a></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
