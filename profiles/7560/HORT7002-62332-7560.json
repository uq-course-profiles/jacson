            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Interest in robotics (automated technology) is increasing in the horticulture sector due to a number of reasons, but particularly due to challenges associated with sourcing human labour for repetitive tasks. As the development officer of a medium to large horticulture enterprise, prepare a proposal for your manager for the implementation of robotics (automated technology) into a production sector of the company to improve productivity. To complete this assignment, you may find it useful to first explore the definition of robotics (automated technology), then select a horticulture industry of your choice (e.g., nursery, floriculture, vegetables or fruit) and for a particular enterprise (e.g., stone fruit orchard, hydroponic strawberry farm), research a production task/process that would benefit from the use of robotics.</p>\n<p>Note, selecting a production task/process where robotics (automated technology) are <strong>not</strong> already commonly used will demonstrate a higher level of critical thinking. For example, equipment that is used to sort individual fruit by weight and colour are commonly used in packing sheds, however, you may find equipment designed for packing lines with new capabilities and benefits that would be appropriate for this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide for preparing the proposal</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Outline the horticulture industry you have selected and explain the horticulture practice/process you have chosen and why robotics (automated technology) should be considered. Economic factors are likely to be the main motivation, however, other horticultural, social and environmental factors should be considered. (200 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed robotics</strong></p>\n<p>Describe how the horticulture task/process can be accomplished with robotics (automated technology). Ensure that you include scientific, plant/crop physiology, literature to support your argument. For example, if a robot is used to prune fruit trees, explain the scientific reason for the removal of wood, i.e., yield and tree health. (800 words)</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits and constraints</strong></p>\n<p>Describe the benefits and constraints of using robotics (automated technology) for the particular horticulture task/process you have chosen. The benefits could include production advantages, improved/consistent quality, workplace safety, economic and social gains, and environmental sustainability. The main constraint is likely to be cost, however, other constraints should also be identified and justified. Ensure that you use scientific literature and reports from reputable sources to support your statements. For example, you could research the injuries associated with a manual task the robotics (automated technology) would replace or perhaps the robotics (automated technology) themselves will introduce new safety problems.
