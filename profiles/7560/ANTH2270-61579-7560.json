This assignment develops your ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely, an essential skill for your studies and career.</p>\n<p><strong>Ignite</strong> is a presentation style used by academics to engage general audiences. Your presentations will use 12 slides that automatically advance every 15 seconds for a total of 3 minutes. There's no stopping or going back once you start. The slides should be image-focused with minimal text, and you'll present live in class whilst being recorded via Echo360. Each presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session with the class.</p>\n<p>For your research phase, you'll read assigned journal articles and book chapters on migration anthropology, then choose one specific focus to highlight, such as a particular theorist, migration history in one country, or a specific migration practice. We'll discuss topic options in the first seminar. You'll then present during the week that matches your chosen topic, focusing on transmitting crucial information both verbally and visually, and prepare for follow-up questions from the class.</p>\n<p>You'll complete two presentations this semester. The first presentation is worth 15% of your final grade and is due in the week 4 seminar, and the second presentation is worth 25%. Due dates for the latter will be negotiated in the first two weeks of semester. This assignment teaches you to synthesise complex academic material, communicate clearly under time constraints, use visual storytelling effectively, and present confidently to an audience.</p>\n<p>Format details will be covered in the first seminar.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Use: </strong>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
