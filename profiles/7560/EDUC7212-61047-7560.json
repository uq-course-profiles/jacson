This is not an annotated bibliography; your aim should be to critically review the studies, synthesize the findings and draw on these findings to make a case for the proposed topic. This literature review can be used to help inform Assignment 2. Performing this first assessment task successfully will require you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify clearly the research problem/topic/issue that you are proposing to investigate;</li>\n<li>Review and synthesize relevant, timely and substantive studies; and</li>\n<li>Identity a ‘gap’ - an under-researched area - in the literature to provide justification for the research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The review should focus on relevant and up-to-date research on the topic.
