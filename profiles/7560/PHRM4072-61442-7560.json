The key component of reflection is ensuring the creation of a specific plan to aid learning within the scope of the situation, and describing how this action is being undertaken.</p>\n<p><strong>Each reflection should not exceed 500 words. More information and marking rubrics for the SEAL reflections can be found on Learn.UQ (Blackboard) on the Assessment page.</strong> </p>\n<p>Students should consider their individual experiences during their Placement in order to reflect effectively within each of the different schemas described below: </p>\n<p><strong>1. National Competency Standards (NCS) schema:</strong> Please read the relevant <strong><em>National Competency Standards (NCS) Framework for Pharmacists in Australia 2016</em></strong> (as available through the course Blackboard site) and familiarise yourself with the Standards before attending your placement. Students are to reflect on ONE chosen Enabling Competency from the NCS in each reflection. Each selected Enabling Competency should be different from the others. Students should reflect on the level of skills, knowledge or professional attributes they acquired/demonstrated during their placement experience and relate this clearly to the chosen Enabling Competency. Students are also encouraged to reflect on their own unique personal experiences (e.g. feelings, personal attributes, individual strengths/weaknesses at this stage of development, etc). </p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Lifelong Learning (LLL) schema</strong>: Students should reflect on their own future learning needs and how they have used feedback to inform their ongoing development, which will enable them to professionally manage their internship and joining the pharmacy profession. They should focus on how their placement uncovered specific elements of their own practice and learning that they consider to be particularly relevant to their future practice, and for becoming a lifelong learner who will remain committed to their continuing professional development. </p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Employability schema</strong>: Employability can be defined as a “<em>set of capabilities and personal attributes that empower graduates to perform effectively in the workplace, generate opportunities, and create positive social and economic impact”</em>. This Employability Reflection is an opportunity for students to reflect on their own personal experiences in relation to any aspects of their individual employability at this late stage of their student career path. It is strongly recommended that students familiarise themselves with, before the placement, the UQ’s Employability Framework for necessary background information on the meaning, definitions, structure, and relevant considerations in preparation for addressing this assessment item: https://employability.uq.edu.au/about/employability-framework. </p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools may be used appropriately to support students in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly acknowledge any use of AI in each instance.

The maximum word count for the student reflection is 500 words. Students can use the SEAL template of reflection if they wish, but can also follow a more generalised structure to reflect on their overall experience in undertaking the chosen EPAs during their placement. It is important for students to focus on their learnings, linking actions to their future development. Students can include references or attachments where necessary/appropriate to support their reflection.</li>\n<li><strong>Individual Learning Plan (ILP):</strong> The ePortfolio provides clear instructions and a template for students to complete their ILP based on their performance in undertaking the EPAs and feedback from their preceptor during their placement.

Recognising the cultural, social and physical diversity of patients is essential to the delivery of a holistic healthcare solution. Socially accountable care focuses on a health care approach where practices are oriented towards community and social impact, promoting equity and prioritising the social determinants of health such as education, employment and environment, while holistic care considers treating the person as a whole, not just as a disease or symptom, and integrates mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and social needs into the care provided. </p>\n<p>As part of building an increased awareness of the diversity of patients encountered across the Community Pharmacy setting, students are required to submit a report addressing the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify a particular group of patients serviced by your pharmacy</strong>. Some examples may include, but are not limited to, people in the following categories: </li>\n<li>Physical or Cognitive Disability </li>\n<li>Aged care/Elderly </li>\n<li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People </li>\n<li>Mental Illness </li>\n<li>Culturally/Linguistically Diverse People </li>\n<li>Patients on opioid replacement therapy </li>\n<li>Low socioeconomic demographic</li>\n<li>Paediatric population</li>\n<li><strong>Consider how your pharmacy caters for the socially accountable and holistic care</strong> of your selected patient demographic. Consider a broader scope beyond just the usual clinical duties of a pharmacist<strong> </strong>(i.e. duties such as webster packs, MedsCheck, medication counselling would be considered usual clinical duties so students should explore other aspects of socially accountable and holistic care beyond these services). Some questions to consider may include: </li>\n<li>What protocols/procedures/trainings (if any) are in place to assist in the care of these patients (E.g. specially trained staff)? </li>\n<li>What physical assistance (if any) does your pharmacy provide (E.g. wheelchair ramp access, wide aisles, etc)? </li>\n<li>How does the physical layout of the pharmacy consider patients in your specific patient demographic? </li>\n<li>Discuss with your preceptor or other pharmacy staff and consider interviewing some patients/carers for feedback and to gather anecdotal evidence of their personal experiences. Students are encouraged to think creatively about how to gather information relevant here. </li>\n<li><strong>Perform a literature review of the current evidence for best practice</strong> in the care of patients in your chosen demographic. Consider recommendations from relevant governing or professional bodies, Royal Commission recommendations, and relevant publications from contemporary research. </li>\n<li>Identify any gaps between current and best practice and <strong>create a plan specific to your placement pharmacy</strong> to address gaps/implement any new recommendations to optimise socially accountable and holistic patient care in your chosen patient population. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report should be a maximum of 2000 words and students should follow the report structure outlined on Learn.UQ(Blackboard).
