You are not required to adhere to the PRISMA guidelines, and you do not need to provide a summary table which describes all of the studies you are discussing in your review.</p>\n<p>Rather, you will engage with a body of literature which is known to provide some support for the effectiveness and/or efficacy of a counselling approach with a specified client population. You will critically review this body of literature for the purpose of evaluating the robustness of the evidence and any limitations and/or considerations practitioners should be aware of in order to utilise the approach effectively.</p>\n<p>This task does not require you to have an advanced understanding of research methodology and design. When evaluating the robustness of the evidence base, you will consider basic methodology factors such as the number of studies that contribute to the evidence base, the number of participants included in those studies, the presence (or not) of control groups, the limitations of the studies (as identified by the studies’ authors), recommendations for appropriate implementation of the approach, as discussed by the studies’ authors.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
