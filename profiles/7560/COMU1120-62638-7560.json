Tutorials are designed to help you explore and understand course material presented in lectures, sometimes through the introduction of additional academic information. Throughout the semester, you will be expected to regularly attend - and actively participate in - your scheduled tutorials. Through tutorial participation, you will enhance your understanding of media and society, as well as develop your ability to demonstrate effective academic communication and argumentation.</p>\n<p>Each tutorial is worth 5 points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 points for completing the assigned activities</li>\n<li>3 points for making a meaningful contribution to the tutorial</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The activities required for completion each week will be clearly delineated in the weekly tutorial instructions, posted to Learn. Partial marks will not be given (i.e. you either get the points for completion of the activities or you don't; you either get the points for a meaningful contribution or you don't).</p>\n<p>A 'meaningful contribution' may include, but is not limited to: asking a thoughtful and relevant question; sharing a thoughtful and relevant answer or comment; providing peer feedback; or helping a peer complete the assigned activities if they are struggling. Through your meaningful contribution, you are valuably contributing to the co-creation of knowledge in the class. The presiding tutor will assess whether or not your contribution is meaningful and worthy of points. If your tutor does not observe your meaningful contribution, it will not be counted.</p>\n<p>While you will receive a mark for tutorial participation each week, only your best five tutorials will be added together to give you a final mark out of 25. We encourage you to participate in as many tutorials as you are able.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.

Your essay must make an argument that is represented in a thesis statement that is included in your essay's introduction.</p>\n<p>Your thesis statement should be specific. 'Social media are bad for society' is not a sufficiently specific thesis statement. 'Instagram filters negatively influence the self esteem of users' is better (as this thesis statement has been provided as an example you may not use it for your essay - doing so will result in a failing grade). Generally, the more specific your thesis statement, corresponding pieces of evidence, and discussion are, the easier it will be for you to achieve the critical depth we expect in this essay.</p>\n<p>Your essay must meaningfully use at least one media studies concept or theory covered in the course to support your argument. Do not try to use all of the concepts and theories we have covered in the course; pick those that you feel are most relevant to your argument. <strong>If no course concepts are meaningfully integrated into the essay, you will not achieve a passing grade.</strong></p>\n<p>Your essay must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An introduction, which includes an argument and signposting (i.e. a brief review of how you will make your argument in your essay).</li>\n<li>A clear, critical argument that is relevant to the course, supported with reference to at least one relevant primary source (e.g. a media artefact).</li>\n<li>At least three academic sources, used in meaningful ways and cited correctly, in accordance with APA style.</li>\n<li>A conclusion that briefly reviews the argument you have made in the essay, and clearly conveys to your reader why your argument matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Specific advice will be given in lectures and tutorials, and on Learn, about how you should research, structure, and write your essay.</p>\n<p><strong>You must reference at least three different academic sources, with at least one of these sources being from the course reading list, in order to achieve a passing grade</strong>.</p>\n<p>Through this essay, you will demonstrate your ability to describe the roles media play in society, and to critically analyse media environments and their sociocultural implications.
