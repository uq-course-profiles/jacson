For full details, including the marking rubric, please refer to the course Learn UQ (Blackboard) site.</p>\n<p><em>Rationale</em></p>\n<p>The Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) Practice Standards (2023) require social workers to “<em>practice within a professional knowledge framework </em><strong><em>informed by a critical understanding of contemporary social work theory and research</em></strong>” (Standard 5) and to “<em>be </em><strong><em>active learners, open to new and emerging knowledge, research and evidence informing their practice</em></strong>” (Standard 9).</p>\n<p>However, evidence suggests that social work practitioners report a lack of confidence in research knowledge and skills (DeFaia, 2015) and may dismiss the relevance of research to their practice (Cameron &amp; Este, 2008). Journal clubs have been identified as a way of helping students and practitioners to become more confident in appraising research and to help show how research can inform practice (Moore et al., 2013). Using a journal club as an assessment task is informed by research on social work education that suggests that hands-on activities (Lei, 2008) and peer learning (Pan &amp; Tang, 2005; Wilson, 2006, 2008) can reduce student anxiety and support learning about research.</p>\n<p><em>Task Description</em></p>\n<p>In your group (3–4 members), facilitate a 25 or 30-minute journal discussion with the class, based on your appraisal of research papers on a shared topic.</p>\n<p>For this task some elements of the task attract an individual mark and others related to group facilitation will receive a group mark. Please check the marking rubric on Blackboard.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

You will then use the literature review as a stimulus to develop a research proposal that outlines the details of a research project that would help to address the identified knowledge gap.</p>\n<p>The exam will be a series of short answer questions that mirror the elements of a research proposal.</p>\n<p>Your responses must demonstrate engagement with and understanding of the SWSP3303 course material.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
