Search the literature to determine what is known about the tests, and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Write a concise, coherent and well-argued review of this literature (including at least 10 references). Your review should not simply be a set of quotes or a summary of a series of articles. You are to take a critical stance on the literature you review, synthesizing key points in a way that critically evaluates the information you source. Summarize what you learned from the review of literature that is of relevance to your practice in psychological assessment.
