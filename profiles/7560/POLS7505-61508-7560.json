Focused discussion, whether as a whole class or in small groups, is intended to stimulate critical thinking about the ideas presented in readings and other course material, and to facilitate the exchange of perspectives through which students can deepen their understanding of peacebuilding.</p>\n<p>Your active, informed participation is essential. You should prepare by completing <em>all</em> the required reading. You are also expected to read more widely, developing your own areas of particular peacebuilding interest, and following relevant current affairs.</p>\n<p>Marks will not be awarded for attendance alone, nor for the frequency of contribution. You should attend seminars prepared to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Answer each module's question(s);</li>\n<li>Critique or defend particular readings;</li>\n<li>Reflect on any unexpected insights, or ‘surprises’, you encounter in the reading;</li>\n<li>Draw connections with previous modules' reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Workshop Participation</strong></p>\n<p>Along with seminars, the course will be taught through 5 practice-oriented workshops. Peacebuilding is inherently a collaborative and creative endeavor, and for this assignment you will be asked to work in and contribute to a team. On the first day of the course, you will be asked to join or form a group who will work together to select a conflict-affected setting for which you will collaboratively conduct a conflict assessment (which will also be the focus your individual Peacebuilding Proposal). You will be offered guidance and allocated time during each of the first 5 seminars of the course for your group to plan and conduct your conflict assessment. Each group member is expected to take notes and make comments throughout the process (on a shared Google doc for each group), rotating the notetaker role among group members for each of the 5 Conflict Assessment Workshop sessions.</p>\n<p>Groups will present their conflict assessment/findings to the rest of class in either Seminar 6 or 7 (Week 6 or 7) of the course. Each group is expected to circulate to the class a <strong>1-page summary handout</strong> outlining key conflict dynamics, the tools they used, and peacebuilding implications. This is to accompany the in-class presentation, which should provide an overview of the conflict assessment, explain and justify the conflict assessment tools or analytical approaches used, and identify entry points for peacebuilding. </p>\n<p>Groups are encouraged to present their work using <strong>creative and engaging formats</strong> (e.g., visual maps; diagrams like conflict trees, stakeholder/relationship webs, or timeline strips; interactive elements like colour-coded risks or escalation patterns; spatial or geographical maps to show how space/place informs your assessment). All formats should be clear, well-organised, and visually communicative. The aim is to demonstrate not only what your group has learned about the conflict context, but also how you have critically and creatively engaged with conflict assessment as a foundational practice of peacebuilding.</p>\n<p>The group presentation itself is not marked: this is encourage your group to take risks and engage creatively in this task. Your mark for this task will be based on the quality of your engagement and analysis throughout the Conflict Assessment Workshops, demonstrated in your contributions to discussions and to your group's shared Google Doc throughout the five in-class workshops (both as a notetaker and in your comments/suggestions in the document, for example in: sharing relevant resources with the group, offering reflections on what tool/approach to use, suggesting what factors to consider/weigh in the analysis). This requires that you come prepared for the Conflict Assessment Workshops, having researched and read relevant material on the conflict you are assessing.</p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempt to use AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Your statement should consider how your personal background, life experiences, identity, professional roles, academic studies (including this course!), and/or social location shape your understanding of and approach to peacebuilding. Based on this, you are to interrogate how you would engage in peacebuilding practice, as well as the potential biases, blind spots, strengths, and ethical commitments that you may bring to the field.</p>\n<p>The Statement should identify an aspect of peacebuilding that you are particularly interested in (role, geographical context, and/or issue area, e.g.: economics, security, rule of law, transitional justice, gender, Indigenous peoples, technology), identify key challenges or dilemmas you might confront as a 'real world' peacebuilder, and articulate how you would navigate these challenges. The Statement should demonstrate thoughtful engagement with core concepts, approaches, or debates we've covered throughout the course, such as (but not limited to) differing approaches and models of peacebuilding and questions of power, authority, legitimacy, effectiveness, and governance in peacebuilding.</p>\n<p>Key questions to help guide you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I think peace should be defined, and why? What should the primary goals of peacebuilding be? How should these goals be achieved in peacebuilding practice?</li>\n<li>How do I understand the concept of legitimacy in peacebuilding, and how might my own identity, values, or positionality influence what I see as a legitimate actor, process, or outcome in a conflict-affected context?</li>\n<li>What peacebuilding approach or 'turn' do I most align myself with, and why?</li>\n<li>What values or ethical commitments underpin my understanding of peacebuilding? Where do they come from?</li>\n<li>(How) do I see my role as a peacebuilder? What peacebuilding role/context/focus interests me most, and why?</li>\n<li>How might my background/positionality shape my engagement with communities affected by conflict? How might I situate myself in relation to power, privilege, or marginality in the contexts I may work in?</li>\n<li>What are the primary challenges, dilemmas, or tensions that I anticipate I would encounter in peacebuilding practice? What tools, resources, or strategies would I rely to help me navigate these?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: you don't need to answer all of these questions. They are intended to help guide you.</p>\n<p>This is not a conventional academic essay, but a personal, critical, and integrative reflection. Students are encouraged to use the first person and must draw on course and wider readings, seminar materials, and relevant life experiences to support their reflections. The citation practice in the Statement should conform to the standards set out in the School of Political Science and International Studies <a href=\"https://polsis.uq.edu.au/student-support\">Essay Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Please consult the criteria sheet in Blackboard for more information on expectations.</p>\n<p>Please note: This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

A failure to reference generative Al or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of Al and MT tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Pass/Fail Oral Interview (Hurdle)</strong></p>\n<p>You will be required to undertake a 5-10 minute recorded interview (via Zoom video) after submitting this assignment. The interview will include a series of questions (approximately 3-5) that prompt you to explain and justify key aspects of your <em>Peacebuilding Philosophy and Positionality Statement,</em> such as the arguments, approaches, concepts, or sources employed. The Interview assesses the Learning Outcomes of this assignment. Eloquence, or delivery of the answers, does not affect the mark.</p>\n<p>There will be a link to the sign-up sheet for interview slots posted in the relevant Blackboard Assessment Folder in Week 7 of the course. The student’s assigned timeslot will be considered the due date and time for this hurdle.</p>\n<p>Students must obtain a Pass grade on the Oral Interview to pass this course. Students who do not achieve a Pass can only receive an overall grade of 3 or less for this course. Such students may then apply for Supplementary Assessment.</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>The Oral Interview assessment task is to be completed in-person.
