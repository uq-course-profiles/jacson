You will analyse the issues and project work presented by guest speakers in light of occupational justice, human rights and social change approaches (advocacy, health promotion and participatory approaches). This assignment requires synthesis and interpretation of theory and information from real-world application of the concepts.</p>\n<p>The guest presenters will speak to their own work. Then in this analysis, you will <strong>select one of the guest presentations</strong> and bring together your understanding from the presentation, the course’s key concepts, and information from research literature to describe</p>\n<p>1)\t<strong>Analysis</strong>: A description of the issue from occupational justice and human rights lenses. </p>\n<p>2)\t<strong>Your vision for a better world: </strong>description of the change you envision.</p>\n<p>3)\t<strong>Briefing</strong>: </p>\n<p>a.\tProvide an example of one project/initiative/activity that the guest presenter discussed and identify the social change approach (advocacy, health promotion, or participatory approaches) that you feel is reflected in their work. Justify why you have identified this approach. Select 3 aspects of the identified approach and relate them to the guest presenters work.  </p>\n<p>b.\tConsidering multi-level responsiveness, how did the guest presenter describe working at various levels (individual though to socio-political)? </p>\n<p>c.\tProvide a summary of one research article that provides support for or further insights pertaining to the selected project/initiative/activity that you have described. The audience of your overview is the guest lecturer and their organisation - this section of the assignment by students with the top three (3) marks for this assignment in each topic will be shared with the guest lecturers as a contribution towards their work in social change.</p>\n<p>4)\t<strong>Critical reflection </strong></p>\n<p>a.\tOpportunities and challenges: Formulate a descriptive list of three opportunities and a descriptive list of three potential challenges that might exist for an occupational therapist working in this field of practice (e.g. FASD, refugee and asylum seeker services, or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Hearing Health). Ensure that you consider multi-level occupational responsiveness that addresses the issue at individual, family and cultural, as well as socio-political levels?</p>\n<p>b.\tWhat this means for you as an OT: select one of your chosen challenges and generate three ideas for ways to begin to address these challenge. One (only one) idea should involve online/social media. Two ideas should be offline ideas/strategies.</p>\n<p>5)\t<strong>Critical reflection - reflexivity</strong> – GEMS only – up to 500 words: provide an account of how your perspective (as shaped by your past training and experience) might influence the ways in which you engage in social change work. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>See the Task Description File on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement: </strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
