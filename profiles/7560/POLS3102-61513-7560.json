Part A is worth 1 mark, part B is worth 3 marks (4 marks total).</p>\n<p>There are ten opportunities to take the quiz, but you only need to do it<strong> </strong>seven times, forming 28% of your grade. If you do more than 7 quizzes, we will select your top 7 results.

We can make accommodations in the lecture for many of the issues documented in plans (e.g., if you cannot handwrite exams).</p>\n<p>If a student has a genuine (documented) reason that explains why they will be unable to attend the lecture on 7 occasions, a one off make up test will be offered late in the semester, using the same master list of terms. In that test you will need to do all seven weeks’ worth of quizzes in one sitting.</p>\n<p>As there is already flexibility built into this assessment to miss up to three quizzes, the make-up quiz does not apply to students who miss up to three lectures for illness, etc. The make-up quiz is <em>only </em>available to students who have a genuine, documented reason for missing a substantive part of the semester (more than three lectures). Reasons may include: long-term work commitments that cannot be altered; sudden/serious illness that requires a lengthy absence; or another documented reason for a lengthy absence.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

Students will be allocated a specific day and time in that week well in advance and these will be communicated via blackboard and email. While there are no extensions allowed for this assessment - they must all be done in the first week of the exam period - students who have access plans or exceptional circumstances (with documentation) should contact the course coordinator if the allotted day or time slot needs to be changed.</p>\n<p>Students with access plans should contact the course coordinator as soon as possible if they require a modification to be made to the assessment. Accommodations in response to access plans are available (via, for example, extending the time given for the test as a whole or its components). </p>\n<p>In the assessment students will discuss course texts with a member of the teaching team on a one-to-one basis. The discussion has two components. </p>\n<p>In component one the student will talk for five minutes about a classic policy text that they have chosen from a pre-circulated list in order to show:</p>\n<p>a. An understanding of the original text’s overall argument/contribution.</p>\n<p>b. Some awareness of its influence in the field of public policy as described in the course texts (no need for original research).</p>\n<p>c. A decision on whether this classic text should still be considered relevant with reasons.</p>\n<p>This will be followed by one or two questions from the marker about the content of their discussion.</p>\n<p>In component two the student will be invited to discuss one cutting-edge component which is chosen by the marker from a pre-circulated list. The student and the marker will discuss this component for five minutes in order for the student to show:</p>\n<p>a. An accurate description of the cutting-edge concept/theory.</p>\n<p>b. Critical reflection on the concept/theory.</p>\n<p>c. A view on whether this cutting-edge aspect has the potential to become a classic.</p>\n<p>The options for the assessment are listed in the learning guide. When choosing the classic text they wish to discuss in component one, students should be aware that this choice will determine the range of cutting-edge topics from which the marker will choose their second component. For example, if you choose a classic agenda setting text you will be asked about cutting-edge agenda setting theories or concepts.</p>\n<p>Note that students cannot choose the same weekly topic on which they presented in the tutorial. </p>\n<p>The learning guide offers more detail on this assessment. Students will also be supported by the teaching team via practice sessions ran during the lecture timetable. However, at its core, this is as an assessment that demands the fulfillment of two criteria: 1) the ability to accurately describe course texts; 2) a willingness to discuss them critically.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
