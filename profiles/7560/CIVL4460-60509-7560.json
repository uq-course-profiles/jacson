This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task.<strong> Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</strong> </p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>Task Descriptions:</p>\n<p>Project 1 has several important learning goals. First, the student should be familiar with the broader social, environmental, and community setting of a road project. Second, in the context of a roadway design, they should be prepared to define the function and context of the roadway in the broader road network, and how it fits into the dimensions of Movement and Place. Third, consistent with this function, they should be prepared to define the road users and how the variety of road users might be accommodated in the road design, especially in the roadway cross-section. Fourth, they should be able to work with existing land use and environmental data with a spatial aspect, including digital elevation models and other on-line sources of environmental data. Finally, they should be able to incorporate land use data, including a digital elevation model and aerial imagery, into design software to begin a roadway design.</p>\n<p>Project 2 has several important learning goals. First, the student should be able to carefully weigh initial trade-offs in design regarding the potential social, environmental, and community impacts in choosing a horizontal and vertical alignment for a roadway. Second, for the roadway design, they should be able to identify an appropriate design speed and major elements of the roadway cross-section befitting the Movement and Place function of the roadway. Third, they should also be able to design a horizontal and vertical alignment to meet existing roadway design guidelines and/or to justify use of the Extended Design Domain for exceptions in the roadway design. Finally, they should be able to use software tools to generate these horizontal and vertical alignments.</p>\n<p>Project 3 has several important learning goals. First, the student should begin to critique preliminary alignments based on speed, cost, and social, environmental, and community impacts. Second, the student should also understand the potential cost implications of a design, in terms of earthwork, structures, and hydraulic elements in the roadway design. Third, they should be able to use common design software to generate roadsides that are fitting to the Movement and Place framework for the roadway. Finally, they should be able to generate earthwork calculations and to represent major structures in the design using common design software.</p>\n<p>Project 4 requires the student to use principles and software for pavement design of the roadway. This would involve an evaluation of traffic loading, geotechnical evaluation of the subgrade, and evaluation of pavement materials and their costs to design a roadway pavement. Then, the student should be able to use common pavement design software to determine the materials and pavement structure necessary to accommodate the design traffic loading on the roadway.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
