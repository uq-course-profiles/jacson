Your portfolio will critically consider contextual, cultural, ethical and /or legal factors that are relevant to your client's digital content needs. It will be informed by weekly activities (during lectures and workshops), and also the feedback you obtained from your tutors for assignment 2.</li>\n<li><strong>The pieces of content you will plan and produce for your portfolio strategically aim to build online engagement, impact, and 'expertise' for our client</strong>. The content should be <strong>data-driven, memorable, meaningful, and newsworthy</strong>. The task will be developed in groups (already self-enrolled on Bb for the Concept Plan) and will aim to respond to the client's brief (check client's brief and digital communication need or request)<strong>. </strong>The portfolio should showcase a rich multimedia immersive, blog-type (or news style) story, copy, or text that will include a set of digital elements/assets (in writing, visual, and/or audio format) that must be well-articulated and coherent. The portfolio will be produced using <a href=\"https://shorthand.com/\">Shorthand</a> (training will be facilitated in classes and online). </li>\n<li><strong>The story should have the potential to be deconstructed in various transmedia assets to be used via used in shared, earned, owned and paid media (e.g. posts, tiles, graphs, instastories). The Shorthand link (with password if any) must be copied to your report (and also to your Bb submission).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The portfolio submission will include</strong>:</p>\n<p>a) <strong>Text in the form of a</strong> <strong>story in blog post style </strong>(<strong>800 words</strong>) written using Shorthand. You will be telling a <strong>memorable, newsworthy, engaging story for your client. </strong>The story will strategically and effectively communicate/promote your client's message <strong>enhanced by digital tools to engage key audiences and build reputation/authority for your client</strong>. <strong>This story will include: Photo(s)</strong> - shot with your smartphone and/or professional equipment hired from MaPS; and/or taken from the client website, or free copyright websites;</p>\n<p>b) A <strong>90 seconds to 2 min-video</strong> (could be broken for example into two 1' videos) - shot and edited with your smartphone or professional equipment hired from MaPS; you may also use material from your client's website or free copyright sites (music, videos, animation);</p>\n<p>c) An <strong>infographic or fact sheet with relevant information</strong>. Other type of graph(s) or statistics may be included.</p>\n<p>d) All these items should be articulated in the <strong>Shorthand story’s layout; however, some assets may be submitted separately to Bb for better visualisation </strong>(if distorted on Shorthand). You will also suggest the use of the content you produce on other platforms (website, microsite, and/or social media platforms).</p>\n<p><strong>Separately, via Blackboard (which allows uploading multiple docs) you will also submit the following pieces</strong>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Video script(s)</strong> - approx. <strong>300 words</strong> (you may also include a <strong>podcast script</strong> if applicable; chat with the course coordinator);</li>\n<li><strong>One-week media calendar (approx. </strong>200 words). Calendar must be relevant to the project and consistent with dates provided by the client (if any).</li>\n<li><strong>A 700-word Report</strong> that outlines and justifies the multimedia content strategy that you created to respond to the brief. This is an important part of the assignment. The Report will briefly describe the strategic process that led you to produce the multimedia content in the Portfolio and explain why this content is <strong>potentially effective </strong>to fulfil your client’s digital content needs. Finally, briefly discuss (just a few lines) any cultural, legal, or ethically relevant issues that may (or may not) be involved in the project. Cite any supporting material (use APA 7th). Include a cover page with the group names, title of the portfolio, make it visually appealing and consistent with the client’s look and feel, and a reference list at the end (these elements will not be included in the word count). <strong>The text in the report is different from the text in your Shorthand story</strong> (these are two different items).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 1</strong>: If you cannot, or do not want to produce a video, and a<em>fter consultation with the course coordinator,</em> you may develop instead a 1-2-min informative (<em>flash briefing</em>) podcast using your smartphone or MaPS' audio studio facilities. You will embed this podcast(s) in your Shorthand. <strong>You may also develop both, video and podcast</strong> but just if you are familiar with these techniques. Mixed media assets or texts are welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 2</strong>: Class time will be spent on developing the skills required to create the portfolio. It is important that your take training or workshops provided by MaPS from week 2 onwards (e.g., Video production and editing; Photography, Audio Recording, etc. - see Blackboard for Calendar and registration). InDesign and WordPress may also help. MaPs offerings in semester 2 will be posted to Blackboard, Learning Resources in week 1. You can use resources available via <a href=\"https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training/linkedin-learning-online-courses\">LinkedIn Learning Online Courses</a> (UQ Library); Shorthand and Adobe Suite (both available to UQ students for free). The use of <strong>Canva </strong>is also recommended for infographics, fact sheets, and calendars.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 3:</strong> <strong>Groups will informally Pitch their portfolio' digital strategy and main assets in workshops (5/6 mins per group + 4 min. for comments) in week 13 to receive feedback before final submission</strong>. Note that you will present just an overview of the strategy and main asset(s) (<strong>NOT the full portfolio).</strong> Presentations will be coordinated with your tutors and recorded. More information relevant to this task will be posted to Bb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Group pitches will be assessed by tutors (5 pts) during week 13 tutorials - Thursday 30 and Friday 31 September. More information on Blackboard. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Peer assessment ('Buddycheck') about your respective team members' contribution will also be part of the task and submitted via Blackboard (valued at 5 pts). More information about this on Bb </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE 4: </strong>This assessment task evaluates students' <strong>human creativity, capabilities and knowledge preferably without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As some digital tools have embedded AI generated assets/material, </strong>you must acknowledge, justify and, if accepted, <strong>reference it in your work</strong> (via caption or footnote). <strong>If using AI, justify why its use is superior to original content created by you, or by the client</strong>. <strong>Also, reference, explain, support, and justify any AI use use in the Report section, as</strong> <strong>otherwise student misconduct may apply. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. Your human creativity, sensitivity, and critical thinking are central to this assignment. </strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
