The Reflective Statement may also be submitted separately, if the student does not wish this part to be available for others to read.\n \nThe folio must include the following sections:\nSection 1\nPresentation of the placement site and your role during the placement. Statement of how placement objectives were met with reference to the type of experience gained at the placement.\n \nSection 2\nLogbooks of clinical contact hours, supervision and other clinically related activities (with hours spent on Organisational or Special project specified), with a summary table.\n \nSection 3\nAny formal documentation of client contact completed in the course of the placement is to be included in this section. This may include psychological reports, discharge summaries, and case notes. If many clients are seen during the placement, mainly include the more comprehensive reports and a representative sample of other types of documentation. All types of documentation must be signed by both student and supervisor, and all client identifying information must be removed. Whereby at certain placements students are unable to photocopy notes and/or reports, then the student is required to type up the case notes as needs to be included in the folio.\n \nDue to the different practices at different placements, it may be difficult to determine the type and quantity of documentation required to meet the criteria in this section. If you are unsure, please confer with the supervisor and Externship Officer at the start of the placement.\n \nSection 4\nThe only psychological report specifically compiled for the folio, is the Comprehensive Psychological Report in Section 4 (a few students might be required to complete this type of report in the natural course of their placement, especially in neuropsychology placements). A comprehensive psychological report (min. 2000 words) on the case that has contributed most to the student’s learning is to be included in this section. An N=1 format may be used (with emphasis on assessment or literature review if the student is not treating the client), or alternatively a professional report format covering the following topics: referral source, referral problem including precipitating and perpetuating factors, previous treatment/solution attempts, history, current life circumstances and important relationships, assessment, diagnosis, case formulation, treatment plan and \n    <button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
