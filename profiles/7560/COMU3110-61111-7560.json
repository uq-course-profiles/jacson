(You are responsible for bringing your own pen or pencil.) You are <strong><em>not permitted </em></strong>to access devices of any kind during the task, but may consult printed or handwritten notes.</p>\n<p>You will be given a specific prompt for each exercise that will refer to content from the <strong><em>required readings</em></strong> and lecture, or will be related to the assessment. Tutors will collect the worksheets afterwards to record completion of the assessment task. Feedback will be given informally in the tutorial immediately after writing.</p>\n<p>Each Weekly Tutorial Writing Exercise is worth <strong><em>5 points</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>You will receive 5 points for each completed and meaningful answer, 3 points for a partial answer, and 0 points for an answer that does not respond to the prompt or if you leave the worksheet blank. You will also receive 0 points if you don't attend the tutorial, or fail to follow the instruction to put away your device during the exercise.</p>\n<p>Partial marks will not be given (either you get 5 points, 3 points, or 0 points).</p>\n<p>Only your <strong><em>best six</em> </strong>Weekly Tutorial Writing Exercises<strong> </strong>will be added together to give you a final mark out of 30 points.
