Each section of the fillable Word document will represent a single component of what would traditionally be included in an essay, such as a thesis statement, main paragraphs, and a reference list. Each section will provide instructions concerning how to complete it, including the word limits for responses.</p>\n<p>The assignment must be submitted as a Word document, and <strong>not</strong> submitted as a PDF or any other file type. Submitting in a non-Word file type will result in a -10% penalty. <strong>Do not rely on Grade Centre in Blackboard for your results. Look at your assessment grade and feedback in Turnitin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Word count: 2,000 words</strong>. NOTE: The word count limit isn't a hard and fast cap that students need to reach. Please note that the overall word count has to include <em>all</em> sections, except for those made up of bibliographic information (sections II and X). Those other sections include sections III and IV, even though they don't have explicit word limits. It's difficult to put work limits on sections III and IV, because a thesis statement may be one or two sentences, while some students may write a little bit more than other students in section IV, or they may go over in sections V-IX. So, the remaining 500–750 words, depending on how much students put in the other word-limited sections, are associated with sections III and IV, or could be some buffer if they go over in other sections.</p>\n<p>Sections III and IV: 500-750</p>\n<p>Introductory Paragraph: 250-300Argument Paragraph 1: 250-300</p>\n<p>Argument Paragraph 2: 250-300</p>\n<p>Argument Paragraph 3: 250-300</p>\n<p>Concluding Paragraph: 250-300</p>\n<p><strong>Total: ~2000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AI: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.<strong> To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</strong></p>\n<p>The assessment must be submitted via Turnitin on the Blackboard page.</p>\n<p><strong>AGAIN: Do not rely on Grade Centre in Blackboard for your results.
