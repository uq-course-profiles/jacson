This includes both raw and processed data, laboratory notebooks, electronic files, reports, and any other project outputs or records generated during the course of the research. The student and supervisor have to sign a declaration as a formal confirmation that the project data and information transfer have been completed, and this document has to be submitted to the School of Agriculture and Food Sustainability Student Services by the due date, together with the Thesis.
