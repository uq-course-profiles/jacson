These are marked on a pass/fail basis and can earn you 1% towards your final grade. Participating in a research plan workshop in Week 9 tutorials can earn up to 6% of your final grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale: </strong>Consistent preparation and participation lead to better learning outcomes and more productive and enjoyable learning experiences. Through participation, humanities students gain a highly valued and distinctive skill set in critical thinking, discipline mastery, evidence-based learning, and collaboration. These skills are required by many workplaces. The ability to write on a set topic and within a short time frame is a valuable academic and vocational skill, and it helps you to track your learning and prepare for written assessment tasks. Finally, this assessment item provides basic weekly feedback throughout the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong>: This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
