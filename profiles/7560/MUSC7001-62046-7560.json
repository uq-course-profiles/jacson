Students are <strong>strongly </strong>urged to follow carefully the advice of their supervisor(s) (and course co-ordinator, if applicable) in relation to the matter of topic formulation. Outcomes are much less likely to be satisfactory in cases where the student's topic gives cause for reservation with the advisor.</p>\n<p>For matters relating to presentation, the student should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>follow the advice of their supervisors;</li>\n<li>consult the <a href=\"https://music.uq.edu.au/files/16914/music-academic-writing-guide.pdf\">School of Music Academic Writing Guide</a></li>\n<li>review previous theses that are recommended by their supervisor(s) as exemplary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the deadline for submitting a complete draft of the thesis to your advisor for final review is Friday in Week 12 of Semester One.

Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Stating rationale and/or purpose of study, as well as outlining and elaborating the research topic/question.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Body</strong></p>\n<p>Usually a number of chapters, comprising, among various possible elements: an examination of current research and related literature to the central purpose of the study leading to relevant research questions and hypotheses (effectively, a literature review); application of a valid research method and approach to address the principal questions or hypotheses, statement of results and discussion of the findings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Synthesising the main aspects of the study. The discussion and anticipation of further study demonstrate an awareness of the implications and further application of the findings in a broader context.</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Students should be informed by the <a href=\"https://music.uq.edu.au/files/16914/music-academic-writing-guide.pdf\">School of Music Academic Writing Guide</a> in the formatting of all aspects of their written work, including layout, typography, conventions (capitalisation, title formats, quotations, musical examples and so on).
