Through the storied reflections you commence to weave your own ‘knowledge basket’ to critically reflect on what you are learning in relation to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. You will be give guidance to completing this task. This is graded pass/fail and requires you to write three storied reflections in response to prompts. All storied reflections must be completed by end of semester.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Students' experience of university life includes interaction with University academic staff, both tutors and lecturers, most of whom are not teaching to an obviously Indigenous student group. Reflect on your own experience of arriving at your first classes at UQ in the first semester of your course. What are the intercultural danger areas in the classroom? How could the cultural safety of that experience be enhanced for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students?</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Your challenge is to develop a 15 minute group presentation (5 people) on improving cultural safety for delivery to University academic staff, including tutors and lecturers.</p>\n<p>Your presentation should be well-researched, engaging, and include at least two scenarios that demonstrate good examples of cultural safety in these settings.</p>\n<p>There are two components to the group presentation: a group presentation component and a peer assessment. The group project requires you to contribute and engage effectively with your group members. Each member of the peer group is required to share equally in the development of the presentation, in presenting, and in preparing the supporting documentation to be submitted. Each student is to provide an evaluation of each member of the peer group via Buddy Check. This will be outlined further and will focus on contributions of each member to the group work and the outcomes the group achieved, the group's performance in presenting work as an integrated whole, the way in which the team members interacted and worked together.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
