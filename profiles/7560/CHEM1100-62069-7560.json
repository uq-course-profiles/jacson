Students will be able to collect, organise, analyse and graphically display experimental data to identify patterns or relationships. You will be able to process your data applying appropriate equations and evaluating the limitations of experimental data. You will make decisions based on the outcomes of your experiments and explain these in terms of chemical concepts. You will communicate experimental outcomes through a written laboratory report. You will prepare for and demonstrate your capacity for working responsibly and safely in the laboratory."
