Penalties will also apply for missing or inaccurate files/documentation submitted with the robot system.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>At the Team Project Final Demo, you will be asked to evaluate each member of your team. The peer assessment factors (PAFs) will modify your project mark to reflect your relative contribution to the assessment, as judged by your teammates.</p>\n<p>The evaluations will be performed by having each team member assessed by the other team members using a peer assessment form. Team members are to use the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Team Player:</strong> Did this person work as a member of a team? Did they wait to be told what to do? Alternatively, did they attempt to control the whole project?</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Input:</strong> The extent to which this team member contributed to generating new ideas in the project, and general problem-solving ability.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Contribution:</strong> The technical skills that this team member brought to the project in areas such as navigation, planning, perception and control, as well as the overall software architecture design.</li>\n<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Did this person perform their assignments effectively and on time? Did this person respond to emails, etc.?</li>\n<li><strong>Hard Work:</strong> The extent to which this person slogged away at their appointed tasks, regardless of their success in achieving good outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Was this person easy to communicate with? Did you have difficulties understanding their issues? Did they have difficulties understanding yours?</li>\n<li><strong>Meeting Attendance:</strong> Did this person attend meetings on time and every week?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The peer assessment factor will be calculated by: (4 * Your Peer Mark / Total of Peer Marks Assigned in Your Team) ^0.6.</p>\n<p>This formula also normalises for team sizes other than 4. A three-member team will typically have peer assessment factors greater than 1 (meaning they don't have to implement as much functionality to get the same overall product mark as a four-member team). A five-member team will typically have peer assessment factors less than 1 (meaning they will have to implement more functionality to get the same mark as a four-member team).</p>\n<p>As an example, if all members of a four-person team receive equal peer marks, your peer assessment factor will be 1. If you are in a three-person team and all members of the team receive equal peer marks, your peer assessment factor will be 1.188. If you are in a five-person team and all members of the team receive equal peer marks, your peer assessment factor will be 0.875.</p>\n<p>If a student does not submit a PAF form, their contribution to the PAF will be accounted as a score of zero awarded to each student, making the resultant scores determined entirely by the team members who did submit a PAF form. The course coordinator and teaching staff will moderate the peer assessments to ensure that marks are indicative of a student's achievement in the course; PAFs which mischaracterise contributions or unfairly penalize or reward team members will be set to null.</p>\n<p>The PAF will be accompanied by a Tutor Assessment Factor (TAF); the two will be multiplied together for the final scaling factor of the final project demo. The TAF will be based on in-class observations of the student interactions and contributions by the teaching staff.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
