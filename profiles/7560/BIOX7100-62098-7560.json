The student should decide on a scientific area that aligns with their Masters program and that interests them. Before the first week of semester the student should secure a supervisor. There are many avenues to identify a potential supervisor:</p>\n<p>·        the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences website (<a href=\"http://scmb.uq.edu.au/\">scmb.uq.edu.au</a>)</p>\n<p>·        the SCMB Research Projects booklet (<a href=\"http://scmb.uq.edu.au/postgrad-coursework\">scmb.uq.edu.au/postgrad-coursework</a>)</p>\n<p>·        web pages of the various research institutes at UQ, links to those web pages can be found here <a href=\"https://research.uq.edu.au/\">research.uq.edu.au</a></p>\n<p><strong>·     </strong>   the UQ Researchers website<strong> (</strong><a href=\"https://researchers.uq.edu.au/\">researchers.uq.edu.au</a>)</p>\n<p>You should contact prospective supervisors and ask whether they have time to supervise your literature review. Supervision will involve meeting with you at least 5 times during semester to discuss your progress and help you with any difficulties you have encountered. Your supervisor must sign the <a href=\"https://scmb.uq.edu.au/files/18632/SCMB%20Postgraduate%20Coursework%20Supervisor%20Approval%20Form%20-%20Jan%202022.pdf\">SCMB Postgraduate Coursework Supervisor Approval Form</a>. </p>\n<p>2. Once you have had an introductory meeting with your supervisor and established the area of research for your literature review, you should begin looking for key papers. This will involve searching the various library databases (<em>e.g.</em> PubMed) for relevant papers. If you are not familiar with these databases, you should enrol in one of the short courses offered by the library. Please ask at the Information desk or contact the UQ library online (https://web.library.uq.edu.au/contact-us) and indicate that you are a postgraduate student. You should then further discuss the area you wish to review with your supervisor to confirm that the area is of current interest to the field and is of sufficient breadth such that there is adequate material to review. <em>The area chosen will not have been reviewed recently.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Preparation of the Literature Review</strong></p>\n<p>The Literature Review will consist of the sections described below and it is expected that the review will cover approximately 100 papers from the primary literature (ie not reviews themselves). The page limit is 30 pages (this does NOT include bibliography, figures and tables)<strong> </strong><em>if this limit is exceeded penalties will be applied in marking</em>.</p>\n<p>Page margins will be set to 2cm all round, pages will be numbered, font of 12pt Calibri or Times New Roman (or equivalent) is acceptable, line spacing of 1.5 will be used. The first page (not counted in the total number pages) should carry your title, course code your name and student number, and your supervisor’s details.</p>\n<p>The Literature Review should be similar in style to reviews published by scientific journals (see Nature Reviews for an example). There is no need to format the text into columns. All figures and figure legends should be inserted into the text as close as possible to the point where the figure is referred to. Figures are very useful - ideally you should create your own to summarise findings from multiple papers. You can use figures from published papers as along as the figure legend is your own words and you reference the source of the image. In general the review would have the following sections:</p>\n<p><strong>(a) An abstract</strong>. This should be no longer than 1 page and should briefly summarise the focus of the review.</p>\n<p><strong>(b) Background</strong>. This section should describe the biological system or process that is the focus of the review. This section should introduce the reader to all of the relevant terminology and describe the established function or role of the components of the system or process.</p>\n<p><strong>(c) Recent Advances.</strong> In this section you should summarise the recent work that has been published in your chosen research area. You should try to categorise findings and present them together. Particular attention should be given to aspects of the research area that are controversial or where conflicting data has been published.</p>\n<p><strong>(d) Conclusion/Perspectives.</strong> This section should be a brief description of the \"state-of-play\" in the research area you have reviewed. What are the overall outcomes from all of the published research? Where to now? You should look to give personal insight into: where advances have truly been made; the limitations of the current published work; and what still need to be investigated.</p>\n<p><strong>(e) Bibliography. </strong>Include titles of research articles, and include URLs</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment of the Literature review </strong></p>\n<p>Finally, remember that the Literature review must be your own work. You may obtain advice and comment from your supervisor on the ideas in your proposal, and from various sources on whether your English expression is appropriate, but you should not request, or expect, others to rewrite your submission. Acknowledge all help and sources, especially if you quote text and ideas written by others. </p>\n<p>Your literature review will be assessed by two examiners using the published criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
