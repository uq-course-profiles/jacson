Data and/or other information collected in the practical needs to be analysed and synthesised based on specific requirements of each practical discussed appropriately within the class. Students will be required to demonstrate practical skills in Neuromechanical techniques and interpretation of data as well as being able and interpret results from research literature using similar methods. </p>\n<p>During the practical you will be required to collect some data that is relevant to the specific learning module. Some basic instructions for analysis will be provided. This data will then be scrutinised with respect to a specific practical or research question that is assigned to you in the practical. You will be required to generate appropriate graphs or tables so that you can present this data to the class. You will also need to examine the research literature and relate your results to what you find is already known.
