Short, in-class, closed-book multiple choice and true-false exercises will be conducted in tutorials. These will constitute 20% of tutorial participation marks, and are designed to test the extent to which students are keeping up with lecture content and set readings. In addition, 10% of tutorial participation is based on engagement and contributions to tutorial activities with particular focus on the set reading. Marks are credited for participation, which includes demonstration of reading the set text and contribution to a community of philosophical inquiry (see marking and criteria below). Advice will be available on the Blackboard online teaching page as to preparation for tutorials. Tutorials run during weeks 2-12 (with no tutorial in week 3) and are face-to-face. This is an in-person assessment not permitting use of AI. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your multiple choice/true-false assessment tasks will be assessed according to the following criteria (20%): </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1.    Ability to produce a succinct response to a directed question.</p>\n<p>2.    Knowledge of key themes, ideas or content.</p>\n<p>3.    Ability to employ relevant terminology.</p>\n<p>4.    Ability to write in clear English (where applicable).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unlike formative assessment undertaken during your course (such as book reviews and essays), quiz answers are typically marked on right or wrong basis for multiple choice, single word and short answer questions. The overall grade achieved for a quiz is arrived at by totalling the marks for its constituent elements.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your tutorial engagement will be assessed according to the following criteria (10%): </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1.    Evidence of participation in discussions.</p>\n<p>2.    Evidence of preparation for the tutorial, most notably through completing the set readings.</p>\n<p>3.    Quality of contributions to discussions.</p>\n<p>4.    Fostering of group discussions, through courteous and respectful interactions with staff and    students.</p>\n<p>5.    Attendance is necessary to fulfill the above criteria, as per the course requirements, but marks cannot be awarded for attendance alone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 7 (High Distinction, 85-100%), your attendance will be flawless and your participation exceptional. This grade reflects exceptional levels of preparation, mastery of course materials, and very high quality contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions. You should be able to engage with your peers very effectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 6 (Distinction, 75-84) your attendance will be excellent and your participation very substantial. This grade reflects excellent levels of preparation, knowledge of course materials, and high quality contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions. You should be able to engage with your peers effectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 5 (Credit, 65 – 74%), your attendance and participation will be good. This grade reflects proficient levels of preparation, good knowledge of course materials, and good quality contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 4 (Pass, 50 – 64%) your attendance and participation will be satisfactory. This grade reflects adequate levels of preparation and knowledge of course materials, and an acceptable quality of contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 3 (Marginal Fail, 45 – 49%) your attendance and participation will be unsatisfactory. This grade reflects irregular attendance and/or participation and superficial knowledge of course materials and basic levels of preparation. However, when in attendance, there is evidence of your ability to demonstrate developing achievement in contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 2 (Fail, 25-44%), your attendance and participation will be very unsatisfactory. This grade reflects irregular attendance and/or participation, minimal knowledge of course materials, little evidence of preparation, and mixed to low quality of contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To achieve a grade of 1 (Low Fail, 0-24%), your attendance and participation will be unsatisfactory. This grade reflects irregular attendance and/or participation, an no evidence of preparation, and little or no evidence of quality of contributions to, and fostering of, group discussions.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
