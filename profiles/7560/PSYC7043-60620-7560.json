The parents are separated but share custody (child spends alternate weeks with each parent). You have met only the parent who presented the child; though they report that the behavioural difficulties occur in both households. The relationship between the parents is described as ‘pretty good’ but the parent you have met seems surprised when you ask whether they were planning to involve the other parent in therapy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.    The client is a 15-year-old who has been referred by the school Guidance Officer for treatment of anxiety. The adolescent lives with their single father, who presents as anxious himself. In the first session, the father states that he would like to be present during appointments as thinks he would benefit personally from learning how to manage anxiety as well as from knowing exactly what is going on with his 15-year-old.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3.    The client is a 12-year-old who has been described by their teacher as depressed. The child has apparently expressed a wish to die on one occasion at school. The referral has been initiated by the biological parents (an intact relationship) on the advice of the teacher. In your first contact with the parents – a telephone call with the mother – you get the sense that the parents might think the teacher is exaggerating the significance of the issues. During the first appointment (with the mother and child), the mother tells you that both she and her partner believe the teacher is over-reacting and that their child is simply more emotional than other children of the same age. They are not sure that their child needs to be seeing anyone for therapy and the mother is hesitant to book a second appointment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4.    The client is an 8-year-old who is presenting with aggressive, bullying behaviour at school. Although the parent agrees that there is a problem, after the first session, they indicate that they do not expect to be involved in further sessions; but rather to drop and collect their child for appointments.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
