Protests are contexts loaded with affects and emotions. We will discuss how paying attention to the political character of these phenomena can enrich our understanding of protest. We will also discuss the methodological challenges involved in the study of emotions in protest contexts and elsewhere. Using the work of Emma Hutchison, we will discuss representations as vehicles for emotion, and we will draw some diagrams together that help us conceptualise how emotions, affect, and protest relate to each other.</p></p><p><strong>Learning outcomes:</strong> L03</p></div></td>",

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO NONVIOLENCE NUMBER 3: Visualising Resistance</strong><br/><p>In this seminar, the third of a series of alternative approaches to nonviolence, we discuss the visual character of resistance. Focussing on street protests, we will see how the visual character of such events are historically contingent. We will also think about representation and the different levels at which the visual plays a role in protest: in the street, in the media, in our imagination, among others. We will use my concept of the 'Visual Lifecycle of Protest' to think about the way that visual feedback loops slowly reshape the visual character of protest. We will briefly discuss visual methods, and together, we will analyse some photographs of protest - both iconic and mundane - to highlight how exceptional and unexceptional visuals play important political roles in society.</p></p><p><strong>Learning outcomes:</strong> L02, L03, L04</p></div></td>",
