The assemblage is broken into three levels (upper, middle and lower) with a different technology and composition of raw materials in each. The study will employ classification and attribute analysis to identify reduction techniques, describe and compare artefacts from each level and will provide interpretive statements about technological change and behaviour at the site (such as organisation of technology, changes in provisioning, changes in raw material rationing, etc). Key artefact types must be illustrated. The report will also employ some common indices of fragmentation, identifiability and richness for each level to assess the information potential and significance of the site.</p>\n<p>The goals of the assignment are to enable students to write a research design, perform a manageable lithic analysis, make choices about appropriate variables, take appropriate measurements, compile and present data, and develop conclusions about the materials while reflecting on the research goals. Generation of summary tables and basic statistics will be necessary.
