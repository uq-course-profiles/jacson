The student should speak in answer with reference to the course's texts (or set parts thereof) for 4-5 minutes (an alarm will sound at 4.30). Three follow-up questions will then be asked that will be intended to allow the student to amplify/clarify their answer and demonstrate their mastery of the texts (answers should be approx. 2 minutes each).
