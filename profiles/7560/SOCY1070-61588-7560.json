For the last few weeks of semester we are looking at how we might respond, which links to the idea of “Solution focused social science”. Our learning module this week introduces this idea, suggesting that the role of social science is not simply to study phenomena, but to provide solutions towards resolving modern social challenges.

We have spent the last section of the course looking at how structure operates. Now we flip to thinking about agency – first of all, how we exercise individual agency, as well as the limits of our individual agency. Then we begin thinking about collective agency, how we can work deliberately to create change in social structures. In the first half of this week’s class, we apply the ideas of individual and collective agency to the case study of fast fashion. How could we create change in this global human rights and environmental challenge? This will help you in your thinking about the final assessment piece for the course. In the second half of the workshop we will undertake Assessment item 1(d), the third in a series of 4 in-class writing exercises. Today’s in-class assessment is worth 20% of your final mark. If you cannot make your workshop time, please see the Study Guide for options on how you can still complete this assessment item. Assessment 1(d) will focus on material from any of the previous weeks (Weeks 8-10).</p></p></div></td>",
