Groups will need to select a time in week 8 or 9 to present.</p>\n<p>By Week 3, you will form a small group (4-5 students) that you will work in for your Group Presentation. You will be given opportunities to form groups during seminars. Your assessment task will be a group presentation, accompanied by short written work.</p>\n<p><strong>Topic Choice</strong></p>\n<p>Your group will choose a topic from a set of possible research topics that will be drawn from material throughout the course. The questions will require students to research and analyse contemporary issues and controversies in international humanitarian and/or international criminal law. The task requires knowledge of the law, relevant case studies, and scholarly literature.</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Oral presentation sessions will be two hours, to allow 3-4 groups to present. All group members must be present for the session. Your group will present to the course lecturers (Professor Liivoja and Dr Goss) and a small group of fellow law students. The oral presentations will be recorded. You may use media to support your in-person presentation, e.g. PowerPoint slides or handouts. Each member of the group will be required to contribute to researching the topic and developing the presentation. Students may decide to share the actual oral presentation process, or choose representatives of the group to present the paper. However, all students must be prepared to answer questions during the Question and Answer component. Every group member will receive the same mark, unless a case is made otherwise. The course lecturers will review the presentation to provide moderation of grades. Further information and details on assessment criteria will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Individual reflection 10% </strong>(650 words maximum)</p>\n<p>By midday on the day of your presentation, each student will be required to submit an INDIVIDUAL reflection on their experience of the task. This will include reflections about the topic and the legal issues studied, your contribution to the project, and the group work process. Words in excess of the word limit will not be read/marked. Further guidance will be provided in class.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=145\">Student Code of Conduct</a>.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
