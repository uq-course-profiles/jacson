The quiz must be taken on your own via Blackboard and can be completed anytime over the 3-day time period set. The quiz will be strictly timed so that, once you open the quiz on Blackboard, it must be completed within the set time limit. Each quiz will comprise 20 multiple-choice questions and must be completed within 30-minute time-limit.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
