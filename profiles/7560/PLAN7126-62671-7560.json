Based on your study of the Development Scheme provided by EDQ, do you consider that the plan is likely to lead to the development of a sustainable neighbourhood? Consider the three components (social, environment and economy) for urban regeneration. You can mention the pros and cons of the plan.</p>\n<p>Question 2. Provide examples of 'green corridors' in Australia or overseas that could serve as exemplars for the redesign of Logan Road for the study area considered in the course?  (2 examples at least). Explain why those examples would be suitable for the redesign of Logan Road in the study area.</p>\n<p>Question 3. Based on the lecture on housing affordability (week 5) and on the readings, give three main reasons to explain about the lack of provision of affordable housing in Queensland?</p>\n<p>Question 4. Choose one reading particularly relevant for the redevelopment of the study area, explain 1. What you have learned with this reading as an urban planner; 2. Why are the concept(s) explained in the reading is/are important for the regeneration of the study area.</p>\n<p>Question 5. Summarise your findings by answering the question: Why is it important for an urban planner to be familiar with the principles of urban regeneration?</p>\n<p>Students should include between 10 and 15 references.

Teams will act as planning consultants reporting to <strong>EDQ. </strong>Each group must submit a report. The overall regeneration plan will be sustainable and accommodate the needs of a variety of stakeholders. Each group will develop a Master Plan based on the principles of urban regeneration for the next 20 years for the study area in Woolloongabba, located within precinct 2 Logan Road (see perimeter attached bordered by Stanley St, Wellington RD, Ipswich RD, Baclava St.) Students will propose regeneration strategies in relation to the principles presented in the Woolloongabba Development Scheme while taking into account the community aspirations/needs as well. Students should be specific about how many residents should be accommodated in the redeveloped study area. In addition, students are to specify the mix of dwellings in terms of price point for the new mixed-use building on Logan Road (with 20% of total residential GFA as high-quality social or affordable housing) in Part II. In any case, the final regeneration plan should include housing affordability as a key component. Ultimately, the regeneration plan will promote a vibrant, well-designed and walkable urban village that will be acceptable for the community. A specific attention should be given to the treatment of Logan Road which is to be redesigned into a green corridor.</p>\n<p><strong>A. Weekly activities in class and submission via Blackboard</strong> <strong>(20%)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1 Individual student presentation</strong></p>\n<p>This invigilated activity in class aims to check on individual student contribution to the final report. Each student must present twice during the Semester on their progress on the report. It is a pass/fail outcome. This is a concise presentation (5 minutes) about the outcomes of the exercise done during the practical and each student should explain about their contribution to the report. If a student fails to present twice during the semester, they will receive a '3' to the overall assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>2 Group work submission via Blackboard</strong></p>\n<p>A written exercise is to be completed before the next practical submitted as group work (only one submission per group). Each exercise is pass/fail and worth 2 points for a total of 20 points over the semester (10 exercises). There will be one question on the lecture/readings and a series of questions related to the practical activities (see blackboard for details).</p>\n<p>Feedback will be provided by the tutor or course coordinator on both the presentation and the written exercise to ensure good progress towards the completion of the report during the semester and a sound understanding of the concepts presented during the lecture.</p>\n<p>The 10 submissions are scheduled as follows:</p>\n<p>Exercise 1: due 31.07 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 2: due 14.08 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 3: due 21.08 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 4: due 28.08 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 5: due 04.09 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 6: due 11.09 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 7: due 18.09 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 8: due 25.09 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 9: due 16.10 before 4pm</p>\n<p>Exercise 10: due 23.10 before 4pm</p>\n<p><strong>B.
