Reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of action research is a useful way of improving your understanding of your role as a practitioner and as an educational researcher.</p>\n<p>Across the first two weeks of EDUC7113 the contemporary landscape of literacy and numeracy will be mapped and explored. With this understanding you will identify a key literacy and numeracy issue that you will explore across the semester. The components of this inquiry are broken into four separate tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Task 1: Action Research Problem Statement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part 1 – Written submission (300 words)</strong></p>\n<p>Action research in education is a reflective research practice that many experienced teachers engage in. It usually relates to improving teaching practice with a key question asking – “How can I improve what I do in relation to…” (see for instance <em>Getting to Know the Problem, Trying to Find a Solution</em> section in McAteer chapter).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are not currently practicing as a teacher you may look at inquiring into something that you are interested in, perplexed by or want to change by analysing documents (e.g. policies, curricula, websites) to inform your <em>future</em> practice.</li>\n<li>If you are currently a practicing teacher, it is important for the action research to be small scale and manageable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Your task:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your inquiry by forming a problem statement and key question and sub questions.</li>\n<li>Goal: The purpose of this task 1 (Part A) is to clarify focus of your inquiry. (300 words, written submission).</li>\n<li>For your reference: We have listed some readings at the end of this document. Use p. 15 of Efron and Ravid (2013) as a guide for writing a problem statement and pp. 31-33 for guidance on research questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part 2 – 2-minute Presentation (Pecha Kucha)</strong></p>\n<p>Your task:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare, record and submit a presentation to introduce your research problem, the context and an argument why your inquiry is significant.</li>\n<li>Format: Pecha Kucha – Slideshow with visuals where each slide is roughly 20 seconds (no more than 2 mins total).</li>\n<li>Goal: Pique our interests and demonstrate your professional multimodal communication skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For reference: <a href=\"http://www.pechakucha.org/\">http://www.pechakucha.org/</a></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
