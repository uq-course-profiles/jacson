Note that lack of communication by you with your advisor may lead to a low mark regardless of the quality of the Final Report submission.</p>\n<p>The mark that you achieve for Thesis Project Execution is another piece of evidence that you can submit to a perspective employer as it demonstrates your initiative, motivation, and ability to manage a project.</p>\n<h3>Marking</h3>\n<p>Thesis Project Execution will be marked by your advisor using the rubric in the 'Engineering Thesis Handbook' document that can be found on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>There is also a Pass/ Fail element that serves as validation of your efforts and ascertains that generative AI was used responsibly and critically. If your advisor fails to validate your input, you will need to provide evidence of why you should pass to the Course Coordinator. This evidence could take the form of minutes from your advisory meetings, copies of draft documents at each iteration, email communications etc. on the UQ Research Data Manager (RDM).</p>\n<p>Note that if, at any stage, you feel that you are not receiving adequate support from your advisor, you should contact the Course Coordinator (<a href=\"mailto:l.kavanagh@uq.edu.au\">l.kavanagh@uq.edu.au</a>) as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Blackboard for detailed marking criteria.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
