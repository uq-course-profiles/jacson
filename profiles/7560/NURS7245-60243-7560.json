The development of a Conceptual Framework for the Nurse Practitioner outlines the systemic process to ensure the essential elements of clinical practice, governance, evaluation, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n<p>The aim of this assessment is for you to build a Conceptual Framework to implement the role of a Nurse Practitioner within practice. This should be focused on your area of clinical speciality and incorporate essential stakeholder engagement throughout the development phase.</p>\n<p><em>Part A - The Proposal </em></p>\n<p>This stage involves you completing a proposal template for a Conceptual Framework for the Nurse Practitioner role within your area of specialty. This will include content around the context, aims, proposed model of care, governance, and audit.
