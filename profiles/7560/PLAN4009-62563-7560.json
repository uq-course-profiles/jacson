The proposal should include the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the background to the intended research;</li>\n<li>the research question, aims and objectives; the research methods;</li>\n<li>the expected outcomes;</li>\n<li>the significance of the research and its contribution to new knowledge;</li>\n<li>the budget for the research (if applicable).

After successfully submitting an assignment through Turnitin, a ‘Submission Complete!’ screen will be displayed. It is the student’s responsibility to check assignment preview and confirm successful submission. If the ‘Submission Complete!’ screen isn’t displayed, the student should regard the submission as unsuccessful. Students should download a copy of the digital receipt as proof they have submitted the assignment.
