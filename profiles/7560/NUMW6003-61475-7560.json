This variance is to ensure adequate information is presented across the introduction, literature critique, design, results, discussion and recommendations and conclusions; your supervisors will guide you to your word length based on the approach you take with your thesis.</p>\n<p>The final format of the honours thesis may take the form of a traditional thesis (as detailed below), or as a thesis including publication/s (likely manuscripts under review given the timeline of the honours program). Where publication/s are included in your thesis you will need to provide a response addressing each of the thesis sections that would be addressed in a traditional thesis and how you have addressed these in your manuscript. Further, when submitting a thesis by publication, you will also be required to submit evidence of submission to your chosen journal and the journal aims, scope and guidelines. The journal must be mutually agreed upon between you and your supervisory team.</p>\n<p>The thesis format for Nursing and Midwifery Honours follows the UQ Thesis requirements, which includes the UQ preamble (Word template is available in the course Blackboard Assessment Tab).
