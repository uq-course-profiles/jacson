These standards, and your inherent program requirements, may be used to determine your ‘<a href=\"https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/student-integrity-and-conduct/fitness-study\">fitness to study</a> ’. More specifically, students undertaking this course, must meet the following Student Professionalism criteria:</p>\n<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Absences and non-participation, including e-learning activities, will require supporting documentation and additional tasks may be allocated in lieu of missed learning experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Punctuality</strong></p>\n<p>Punctuality is expected at all times, including e-learning activities. Late arrival or early departure is not acceptable.</p>\n<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>\n<p>Active engagement in learning experiences is expected at all times. Further, all equipment requirements should be organised ahead of time and where travel may be required, individual arrangements made ahead of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Interactions with others</strong></p>\n<p>You must conduct yourselves in an appropriate manner. This includes maintaining respectful relationships with all staff, your peers and community members. Your behaviour, language and sentiment should not offend, discriminate, harass, vilify or victimize others. The UQ Handbook of University Policy and Procedures sets out your rights and responsibilities in regard to this (<a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=285&amp;version=1\">Prevention of Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Behaviours Procedure</a>). This extends to formal and informal communication in both written and oral form. </p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>\n<p>Thorough preparation, including careful written planning utilising feedback and reflection, are essential to good practice. Thorough preparation also includes research, the collation of resources, and conscientious rehearsal and practice of your skills and where required, written preparation must be available for perusal by university teaching staff prior to class.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>Whilst in a practicum setting, including e-learning activities, you are required to adopt an appropriate appropriate and high standard of physical presentation. That is, shirts neatly tucked in; plain coloured dress shorts (longer than mid-thigh) or pants; closed toe shoes; hair neatly presented. You should consult with your site supervisor/course coordinator, regarding body art and piercings.</p>\n<p><strong>Initiative</strong></p>\n<p>You are expected to demonstrate initiative and enthusiasm in undertaking course tasks. Also, you should be adaptable and independent. If something does not go to plan, find a solution without commotion. Acknowledge it is your responsibility to anticipate future issues and should flag with appropriate UQ staff as early as possible where, for example, absences and/or late assessment submission may occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
