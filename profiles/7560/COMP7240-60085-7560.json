Students will be expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain and identify key segments of their code</li>\n<li>Answer questions on how they would implement new features or modify existing functionality</li>\n<li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of their design decisions and problem-solving approaches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>grading of both the React Web and React Native assessment items</strong> will also occur within these sessions. Students must submit their React Web and React Native assessment items prior to attending a Project Demonstration and Code Review session. If <em>less than 50%</em> of the required functionality, based on the assessment brief and rubric, is implemented, the <em>Project Demonstration and Code Review</em> grade will be capped at 50%.</p>\n<p>Students must present their work and show their project in a Code Editor. The<em> use of AI-enabled code assistants</em>, searching the code-base or web, or <em>machine translation tools</em> during the review is not allowed. The goal is to assess each student’s individual understanding of their submitted work.</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
