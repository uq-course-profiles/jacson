As the muscular system drives and coordinates the movement and orientation of the body, and assists the skeleton in support and protection, this module also further familiarises the student with the general structure, arrangement and movements of the body, as well as develops an understanding of how these movements are caused and coordinated. A detailed knowledge of the attachment and arrangement of the muscles relative to the bones and joints of the skeleton (covered in the previous module) is important foundational knowledge for understanding how muscles and groups of muscles generate and coordinate movement and orientation of the body.",
