You will create and present a series of digital media artefacts (photos, advertisements, videos, social media content, packaging designs etc.) about the media technology you created for the media proposal, alongside curatorial notes explaining the origins and design of the artefacts and why they are relevant to the exhibition. These artefacts should be chosen to demonstrate how the media technology you created for the first assessment was marketed and received by society, exploring the consequences of the technology through social, political and cultural lenses. You must submit your Adobe project files and cite any images/assets you have sourced to use in the portfolio. <strong>Your own creative work will be highly valued</strong>. Finally, you will submit and present a 500 word critical reflection on how the portfolio uses design to speculate about the future and critically speak to the present, with reference to course readings and materials and your own academic research. </p>\n<p>The final assessment consists of three components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Media Portfolio </li>\n<li>Curatorial Notes and Critical Reflection </li>\n<li>Presentation </li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Media Portfolio: </strong>Students are expected to hand in a media portfolio that builds on their designs from the Media Proposal and Design Draft. The portfolio should explore social, cultural or political issues through audio-visual means, bringing strong understandings of media theory to life. The content of the portfolio should be discussed with your tutor in advance of submission, but must have been created using the Adobe suite unless permission is received from your tutor. It can include a wide variety of mediums and forms, but all media must be edited and polished with attention to typography and other design aspects, and incorporating strong prose or copy. If internet-sourced imagery is used, it has been cited and substantially altered in software programs alongside original material. The project should not rely on AI produced imagery in a way that jeopardises the project's originality and the student's demonstration of advanced media production skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Curatorial Notes and Critical Reflection:</strong> You will write 500 words of curatorial notes from the perspective of a curator, explaining the origins and design of the media artefacts, and why they are relevant to the exhibition. You will also submit a 500 word critical reflection from your own perspective that explains how the portfolio uses design to speculate about the future and critically speak to the present, with reference to course readings and materials and your own academic research. This should be submitted alongside the portfolio. </p>\n<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> In weeks 12 and 13, you will be assigned a week to give a short presentation about your project. This presentations should explain the media technology, the media artefacts you've created, and how they speak to a social, political or cultural issue with reference to academic research and course materials. </p>\n<p><strong>Further details will be made available in a task sheet and rubric on Blackboard.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
