It should consist of (1) one paragraph detailing a research puzzle and (2) a research question.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>second </strong>part of the task, you will develop your puzzle and question into a research plan. The research plan will detail how you intend to answer your question. It should have three components: (1) Information about your general argument, including at least three reasons for making that argument and at least one potential objection; (2) information about the structure of your essay; (3) information about your main sources/readings for the essay. This information can be presented in any form, including bullet points and tables. <strong>Your Research Plan – Final</strong> must be submitted via Turnitin on the Blackboard page by the listed <strong>Due Date </strong>for this assessment task<strong>. </strong>In total it should consist of (1) one paragraph detailing a research puzzle, (2) a research question, (3) argument section, (4) structure, (5) sources.
