These are events or ‘light bulb moments’ which occurred during (or as a result of) your clinical development and have impacted you in an important (critical) way. A total of two written reflections need to be submitted (upon the accrual of 60 and 100 placement hours, respectively). They should provide insight into how your professional skills and attributes improve, the challenges you overcome and identify, and the new training methods you’ve added to your professional ‘toolbox’.
