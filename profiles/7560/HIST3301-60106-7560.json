Discuss the factors that led to the mass killings of ethnic Armenians in 1915-16 by the Ottoman Turks. Did this constitute a genocide? Why is this history so controversial?</p>\n<p>2. Discuss the difference between Raphael Lemkin's concept of 'genocide' and Hersch Lauterpacht's concept of 'crimes against humanity'.</p>\n<p>3. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Comment on how the Convention was shaped by the political and historical circumstances when it was produced.</p>\n<p>4. Discuss the differences between the legal definition of 'genocide' in the 1948 Genocide Convention and the various scholarly definitions of genocide.</p>\n<p>5. Discuss the controversy in the scholarly literature between the \"intentionalist\" and the \"functionalist\" explanations of the Holocaust.</p>\n<p>6. How distinctive is the Holocaust in the history of genocide? Argue with reference both to the Holocaust and other cases of genocide in the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>7. Do incidents in the historical treatment of Australia's Indigenous peoples by settlers constitute 'genocide'? Discuss the historiographical debate on this question.</p>\n<p>8. Evaluate the achievements and shortcomings of the International Tribunals in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, or Cambodia.</p>\n<p>9. Were the war crimes trials in Nuremberg or Tokyo after the Second World War anything more than 'victors’ justice'?</p>\n<p>10. Explain the phenomenon of genocide denial in relation to the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, Darfur, or another incident of your choice. </p>\n<p>11. Evaluate the role of the United Nations in preventing genocide.</p>\n<p>12. Assess the role of socialist ideology in the mass killings in Stalin's USSR or Mao’s China. What other factors were involved?</p>\n<p>13. What factors were responsible for the mass killings in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-78)? Discuss the role of Cold War politics in influencing the history of this period. Did these mass killings constitute 'genocide'?</p>\n<p>14. Why has the history of the 1965-66 mass killings in Indonesia been largely suppressed? What are the reasons for the recently renewed scholarly interest in this historical incident?</p>\n<p>15. Explain the process whereby modern states and ordinary people can willingly take part in genocide or crimes against humanity (y<em>ou may focus on one or more countries</em>).</p>\n<p>16. Take one case of genocide or mass atrocity as your case study and discuss the role of gender and sexualised violence in the violence.</p>\n<p>17. Choose one artist, writer, book or film and discuss his/her/its representation of an incident of genocide (examples include <em>East-West Street, The Diary of Anne Frank</em>, <em>Schindler's List</em>, <em>Maus, The Killing Fields</em>, <em>Hotel Rwanda</em>, <em>The Act of Killing</em>).</p>\n<p>18. Choose one or more cases of transitional justice such as a Truth Commission, an International Tribunal, or indigenous jurisprudence.

Discuss the various measures that states or international organizations have taken to achieve reconciliation after episodes of mass violence. Evaluate how effective these measures have been (y<em>ou may focus on one or more countries</em>).</p>\n<p>21. Discuss the origins and development of genocide studies as a field of study.
