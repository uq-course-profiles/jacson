This assignment is designed to give a real ‘advisor’ experience and as such, it should demonstrate your understanding of the epidemiology of a disease or health problem. </p>\n<p>Examples of suitable animal units or enterprises include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A farm</li>\n<li>An animal care facility</li>\n<li>UQ livestock herd (pigs, horse, dairy, sheep, goats, chickens)</li>\n<li>A zoo population</li>\n<li>Experimental group of animals in a research establishment (eg primates, rats).</li>\n<li>Wildlife sanctuary</li>\n<li>Cat and dog kennels</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>As part of your program you will need to consider how animal groups, and individuals within the group are treated, so it is not advised to select a scenario involving limited numbers of animals or animals that are difficult to monitor. </p>\n<p>The chosen disease must be a realistic animal health problem or potential problem. Examples might include a parasite problem, mastitis in a dairy herd, or perhaps a group syndrome such as ‘skin problems’ in a wildlife refuge. There are many health problems that are worthy of choosing for this assignment. If you are looking for inspiration, you may even contact a real animal enterprise to identify a suitable disease to report on (this is not a requirement, however).</p>\n<p>Suggested Length: 2,000 words (not including references), plus a one page summary sheet to be submitted via Turnitin.</p>\n<p>You will need to post your chosen topic on Blackboard (date to be advised on course Blackboard site) to ensure that each student has a unique topic. </p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong> are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be acknowledged appropriately.
