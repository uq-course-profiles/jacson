Look at your assessment grade and feedback in Turnitin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Word count: 2,000 words</strong>. NOTE: The word count limit isn't a hard and fast cap that students need to reach. Please note that the overall word count has to include <em>all</em> sections, except for those made up of bibliographic information (sections II and X). Those other sections include sections III and IV, even though they don't have explicit word limits. It's difficult to put work limits on sections III and IV, because a thesis statement may be one or two sentences, while some students may write a little bit more than other students in section IV, or they may go over in sections V-IX. So, the remaining 500–750 words, depending on how much students put in the other word-limited sections, are associated with sections III and IV, or could be some buffer if they go over in other sections.</p>\n<p>Sections III and IV: 500-750</p>\n<p>Introductory Paragraph: 250-300Argument Paragraph 1: 250-300</p>\n<p>Argument Paragraph 2: 250-300</p>\n<p>Argument Paragraph 3: 250-300</p>\n<p>Concluding Paragraph: 250-300</p>\n<p><strong>Total: ~2000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AI: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
