The laboratory manual will be distributed at this session.</p>\n<p>The laboratory component for the course is worth 20% of the total assessment for the course. The assessment of laboratory experiments is criteria based. Scores ranging from 1-25 are allocated for each experiment depending on how well students satisfy the list of criteria set down for the experiment. At the end of the semester, these marks are totalled and converted to a final practical mark out of 100, worth 20% of the course grade. During the semester, you can check your marks for the experiments completed via a link on the course web page.</p>\n<p>Students who diligently attempt an experiment can expect to gain a passing score (12+). Students who show at least a minimum level of proficiency can expect a mark of 14, while high achievers will aim for 20 or higher.</p>\n<p>Ten of the twenty five available marks are awarded for your answers to the pre-lab questions. To score full marks, you must answer all pre-lab questions correctly. You should be able to obtain (or deduce) the correct answers for pre-lab questions from the information provided in the notes (or references therein).</p>\n<p>The experiments are a separate part of the course. Thus, while they may explore similar topics, students should not expect an exact overlap with the lecture material. Due to constraints of timetabling, students may encounter concepts prior to meeting them in lectures. The lab manual has been written to take this into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
