Students are expected to work in their own time to complete the group exercise. The ability to work effectively in groups is crucial for the successful completion of this exercise. </p>\n<p>Each group will be required to produce a geological map of the prospect visited during the Field Trip, using an airphoto as a base. You must figure out the scale before starting the mapping exercise. You must also figure out magnetic north and true north and plot an arrow on your map. Each map is to have the names of the authors on it. Each group must also submit one labeled sample of each major rock and ore type. The specimens are not to be more than 15 cm across nor less than 10 cm. No more than 10 samples per group. </p>\n<p>In addition, each individual will be required to submit:</p>\n<p>• a cross-section of the prospect drawn on one of the grid lines at a scale of 1:500</p>\n<p>• a brief (1 page) description of geological structure (dip of strata, cleavage, faults, joints, etc.).</p>\n<p>• a description of the type of mineralization and its relationship to the host rocks.</p>\n<p>Once back in Brisbane, we will examine polished thin sections of samples from the prospect area studied. Each group will describe the thin sections, interpret the geological and geophysical (if available) data, and write a report evaluating the economic viability of the prospect and suggesting any additional work that should be done in the area.</p>\n<p>If a student is unable to attend the field trip, the student must secure a group before the field trip starts, must help interpreting the field information collected by the group, and must compensate the group by carrying extra tasks – for example, drafting the map, providing extra help with the cross-section, describing a larger number of thin sections, etc. – when compiling and writing the final report.
