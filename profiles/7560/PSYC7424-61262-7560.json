Your task is to redesign the system to make it more efficient, productive, and flexible, and to make the work safer and more rewarding for the people concerned. The types of questions that need to be answered include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency: How many staff do we need to deliver the product or service? Do we have too many or too few? How can we deliver our products or services in a more cost effective manner?</li>\n<li>Productivity: How can we improve the quality of our products or services, producing output consistently at a high standard?</li>\n<li>Flexibility: How can we improve the flexibility of the system, making it more responsive and agile?</li>\n<li>Well-being: How can we improve the safety and well-being of our staff? How can we make the work more satisfying and rewarding?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project consists of two phases: an analysis phase and a redesign phase. The purpose of the first phase is to review the effectiveness of the current work process, and identify opportunities for redesign. The deliverable attached to the first phase is a preliminary report. This is to be written up as a technical report, suitable for a business audience. The preliminary report should contain the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Executive Summary:  This section should provide a concise summary of the key points in the report.</li>\n<li>Background:  This section should describe the background to the project, explain the aims and objectives of the project and the current report, define the scope of work, and explain the approach that is to be taken.</li>\n<li>State-of-the-art Review: This section should contain a review of the work design literature to identify the key principles for the design of high quality work.  </li>\n<li>Analysis: This section should present a clear and thorough analysis of the organisational context, work process and work characteristics using the diagnostic frameworks described in class. It should provide a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the current system, in terms of efficiency, productivity, flexibility, and well-being. The analysis should be evidence-based, making reference to the large body of research that has been conducted on work design.</li>\n<li>Recommendations: This section should present a set of preliminary recommendations for work redesign, based on the results of the analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
