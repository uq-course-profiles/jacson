This could be a learning program in a small museum, a regional museum or at state or national / level. It’s up to you to choose. It doesn’t have to be in Australia. Examine the overall strategy of your chosen Learning program and critcally analyse its aims, content and intended audience.</p>\n<p>Some aspects to consider: is the learning program linked to the museum’s current exhibitions or to its collection, or is it independent of these? You could pick one element of the learning program to explore in detail if the program you choose is an expansive one. How does it reference one of the fours fields of learning? What type of learning is it? How does it motivate the audience participation and engagement to learn? How does it sit in relation to that museum’s strategic plan? How is the program accessed?</p>\n<p>Some questions you might ask (suggestions only - not compulsory) include; based on what we have covered in the course to date what kind of learning program is it? Can you discern if the program is successful and if so why/ why not? How is success measured? Can you suggest how the program could be improved? Is it best practice? In what way? Can you suggest another program that is a better example and would develop your chosen learning program?</p>\n<p>Your essay needs an introduction where you discuss what you will do in the essay and why. Your essay also needs a conclusion where you sum up your main arguments.</p>\n<p>Use references from the course and find your own. Uses sources including and beyond those suggested in class. Do use some refereed scholarly articles to support your arguments.</p>\n<p>See the School of Social Science essay writing guide for basic essay questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong> and/or marking rubrics are available in the ‘Assessment’ folder in Blackboard for this course. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Your brief is to expand audience participation for the museum and pitch a new program. Use your learning from this course (i.e. the four fields learning) to suggest the new program. Your program should combine two or more of the four fields of learning; for example digital and well-being.</p>\n<p>Why is your proposed Learning program needed? What does it consist of? How would you do it? Who are your partners? Do you have an audience sector in mind? What will the experience of participating be?</p>\n<p>Group Presentations in week 12. Maximum presentation time per group 12 minutes (TBC). Each member of your group must present for an equal amount of time. 20% of your marks for this project are for your personal presentation and contribution as part of the group project and presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation Hints</strong>:</p>\n<p>Presentation practice runs before-hand are essential. Time your delivery and make edits to the material to present concise but thorough material. You are persuading your potential partners and your gallery manager to get your proposal up and running. It’s a pitch so be persuasive. Your proposal might be participatory in itself.</p>\n<p>Your written submission of 1000 words including references is your own individual work about the group proposal.

Use scholarly work and websites to support your writing.</p>\n<p>Some themes you could reflect on in this assessment include: What did you learn about the process of designing a learning program in a group? What kind of research did you use to create the program, which field was it in? How is your proposal aligned with current research in museum learning? Which work place skills did you draw on and develop? What were the advantages (and disadvantages) of working as a team? What did you learn from the process? How did the proposal develop your work place skills. How did your proposal align with industry standards in learning and outreach?
