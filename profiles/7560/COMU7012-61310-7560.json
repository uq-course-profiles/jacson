The government is a stakeholder in this project along with the factory owners. A number of people living in this neighbourhood have decided to mobilise and contest this decision specifically because of fears of air and groundwater pollution and its impact on people in the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong></p>\n<p>People living in the community have noticed that the local park is being used by a religious group as a platform to expound their values. There are many locals who have heard this group criticise other religions and say hurtful things of people belonging to faiths other than their own. Their views can be considered fundamentalist.</p>\n<p>Both scenarios are based on chapters in the required text by Manuel Castells The Power of Identity. While Scenario 1 is based on Chapter 3 The Greening of the Self., Scenario 2 is based on Chapter 2 The Other Face of the Social: Social Movements Against the New Global Order.</p>\n<p>A set of five questions related to the two scenarios will be handed out along with the answer sheet.</p>\n<p>Duration: 90 minutes</p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
