The main mode of assessment will be different on each checkpoint, but they will all involve the submission of project documentation which by the end of the semester will form the design/requirements document for the project which is of the form that can be the starting point for a different team to further design and develop into a working prototype.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Problem Identification (In-class Presentation in Week 6/ Documentation in Week 7)</li>\n<li>Interim Critique (In-class Presentation in Week 10/ Documentation in Week 11)</li>\n<li>Exhibit and final documentation (Exhibit in Week 13/ Final documentation in Exam week 1)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Grading and feedback on checkpoints 1 &amp; 2 will be formative, intended to provide students with an understanding of the quality of their work against the criteria, and to inform and support their subsequent work to refine and improve their project based on the feedback. The overall grade for the project will be considered holistically, examining work across the whole lifetime of the project, but with an emphasis in particular on the endpoint and on the quality of the process followed to get there.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

In Studio 3 where we do not have a final examination, this assessment item plays a similar role, where you are required to demonstrate what you have learned across the whole course.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of a portfolio in a design course is for you to gather together examples and evidence of the work that you have done throughout the course. Traditionally, portfolios are collections of work that individuals can share with prospective employers or potential collaborators as examples of the work that they have done. In a course like DECO3800, the work you contribute to your team's outcome will be heavily influenced by your skills and background, as well as by the nature of the project you have worked on. The contents of your portfolio might therefore include design work related to any number of things, including: project inspirations from existing products or services; user research to learn more about the context of use; sketches and schematics relating to data structures; visual designs of interface elements; reports on technology spikes; code snippets to explore functionality, etc.</p>\n<p>A studio portfolio will show off not only what work you have done, but also what you learned as a result of doing it. This reflective component is important so that you can demonstrate deeper learning. Your reflections will feature in this studio portfolio through a combination of how you provide a commentary on the work that you are featuring, along with the inclusion of a reflection section accompanying each topic covered in the portfolio. The reflection will be an opportunity for you to connect the work you have collected for display with what you have learned through working on it.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
