The Chief Learning Officer has tasked you with developing training materials regarding relevant laws and regulations. These training materials should serve as a resource for training new staff members in understanding and complying with relevant legal and regulatory frameworks. As a pilot for their training program, you need to develop the training materials for <strong>one</strong> of the areas listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Freedom of Information</li>\n<li>Whistle-blower Protection</li>\n<li>Contempt laws</li>\n<li>Defamation</li>\n<li>Privacy</li>\n<li>Intellectual property</li>\n<li>National Security</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In addition to submission of the training materials, all students will be required to participate in a short draft presentation and peer-feedback exercise in the Week 11 or 12 tutorial. Although not contributing to the final grade, this in-class exercise is a requirement of the assignment. Failure to participate will cap your final grade to a pass overall ie 17.5/35.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Blackboard for further details about how to complete this assignment and how it will be assessed.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. The in-class exercise in Week 11/12 will require students to demonstrate understanding of their chosen topic independent of AI and MT.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
