Each problem set will consist of several problems provided prior to class. During your applied class, students will demonstrate a solution to one of the problems from the assessed<strong> </strong>problem set. A brief one-on-one discussion with the teaching staff on the selected problem will occur, with the student being awarded between 0 and full marks. Each problem set<strong> </strong>is worth 4 marks. Your best 9 problem sets will be used to calculate your weighted mark out of 40. </p>\n<p>It is not expected that all students will have complete and correct solutions prior to attending class<strong>.</strong> The expectation of students is that you will have made an attempt to answer all questions prior to class and that you will work to correct any errors or misunderstandings of the course content during your class.</p>\n<p>If you have fully completed the assigned problems and wish to get marked off at the start of the class, the onus is on you to demonstrate your understanding of the content to the demonstrator.</p>\n<p>If you are having trouble with the concepts or any of the problem sets, feel free to remain for the full duration of the class. As the class progresses and more people are marked off and leave, you will likely be able to receive direct attention from any of the demonstrators.</p>\n<p>The assessed problem set will be provided weekly after the lectures, in the week prior to the applied classes. </p>\n<p>This activity will only occur during the applied classes. You cannot just submit the solution later on.</p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
