Students should discuss and review content of presentations in order to avoid disclosing confidential information.</p>\n<p>Aim for a talk that is no more than 11-12 minutes long (e.g. 12 slides), which will allow three minutes for questions in the 15-minute slot.

Students are encouraged to develop and present a \"public-facing\" version of their work (i.e. non-confidential components) and to obtain approval from their workplace supervisor. They should discuss this with their supervisor well in advance of presentation day to determine what aspects can be presented publicly. All presentations should be reviewed by workplace supervisor prior to presenting to ensure no confidential information is presented. In most circumstances, it is anticipated that presentations can be adequately adjusted to allow presentation publicly although it may mean a student can't present everything they have done.</p>\n<p>If a student has been unable to remove confidential information to the satisfaction of their workplace supervisor, they may contact the coordinator explaining the situation and request permission to present to a select set of academic staff and workplace members only. This should be done well in advance of the scheduling process for presentations. The coordinator may seek further information from the workplace and/or academic supervisor. Students are still required to attend the symposium.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Details on formatting and submission will be available on Blackboard. </p>\n<p><strong>Early Submission: </strong>If you are currently taking ENGG7292 and this is your final semester, there is currently no provision for the early submission of assessment before the end of academic semester in October.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Translation tools: </strong> This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies to a limited extent, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional information: </strong></p>\n<p>The report/thesis format is flexible, but the following is one possible structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title Page</li>\n<li>Cover Letter – confidential or non-confidential, including a statement of originality (refer to templates on Blackboard)</li>\n<li>Executive Summary / Abstract – concise 1 page summary of project outcomes (could be read as a standalone document)</li>\n<li>Acknowledgements</li>\n<li>Table of Contents</li>\n<li>List of Figures</li>\n<li>List of Tables</li>\n<li>Introduction – placement context and business/academic driver for the project</li>\n<li>Technical Background – review of foundational principles, relevant literature, and/or state-of-the-art</li>\n<li>Project Description – aim, objectives, scope, methodology, and deliverables</li>\n<li>Results and Analysis – critical summary of project findings</li>\n<li>Conclusions and Recommendations of future work</li>\n<li>References</li>\n<li>Appendix A – summary of project timeline, risk analysis, and opportunities</li>\n<li>Appendix B – As required</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The body of the report should not need to exceed 50 pages (excluding appendices).</p>\n<p>Note, this is not a \"required\" format, as reports vary with content of the thesis </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
