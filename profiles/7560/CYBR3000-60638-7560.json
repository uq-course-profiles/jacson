Missed (or late) submissions are included in the calculations as zero marks. To accommodate unforeseen circumstances such as illness, your mark will be based on your best 10 out of the 12 possible submissions. All weeks are calculated of equal value, no matter how many marks are in any particular weekly quiz.</p>\n<p>Quizzes will usually cover topics from the previous week or two of classes, but may cover topics from any previous week and/or may require students to do some research or reading beyond the class notes. Students are expected to take the quiz individually and on their own time and these weekly quizzes are designed to keep students up to date with the week by week teaching material. Each quiz must be explicitly submitted by the due date (i.e. quizzes are not auto-submitted).</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation tools are permitted to be used in the quizzes but they are not required to be used and not recommended to be used as they may inhibit learning.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. You must follow the referencing requirements set out in the assignment specification.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>Assignments with no academic merit (e.g. entirely written by AI, with insufficient content of your own academic value) will be awarded a mark of zero. </p>\n<p>You are encouraged to discuss the concepts behind the assignment but under no circumstances should you show your code to, or allow your code to be seen by, another student. You should not look at the code of any other student. You must sufficiently protect all electronic and paper copies of your code. All submitted code will be subject to electronic plagiarism and collusion detection. You may have to verbally answer questions about your submission as part of the assignment marking process.ﾠ</p>\n<p><strong>Programming Assignment Interviews</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching staff will conduct interviews with a subset of students about their submissions for the purpose of establishing genuine authorship. If you write your own code, you have nothing to fear from this process. If you legitimately use permitted code from other sources (following the usage/referencing requirements in the assignment specification) then you are expected to understand that code. If you are not able to adequately explain the design of your solution and/or adequately explain your submitted code and/or be able to make simple modifications to your solution as requested at the interview, then your assignment mark will be scaled down based on the level of understanding you are able to demonstrate and/or your submission may be subject to a misconduct investigation where your interview responses form part of the evidence. Interview invitations will be issued by email to your student email account at any time up until the end of week one of the exam period. Failure to respond to an interview invitation by the deadline stated in the invitation (which will be at least one week after the invitation is sent) or failure to attend a scheduled interview will result in zero marks for the assignment unless exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated with supporting evidence.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
