Focusing on case studies and examples discussed in class will be helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria</strong>: Answers will be assessed based on understanding and application of basic concepts, clarity of expression, and accuracy in addressing the questions. Proper referencing of theories, concepts and frameworks (e.g. \"According to Madden and McQuin's 'levels of conflict' framework, ......\") and the ability to independently articulate course content will also be evaluated.</p>\n<p>The exam will be an on-campus exam.
