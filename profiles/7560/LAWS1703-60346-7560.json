It has taken several different formats, including a standard essay, a media reflection (finding contemporary media reports to reflect on a particular public law issue), a critical discussion of a particular law or case (eg, Covid directions), a mock legal argument (for a hypothetical court case in public law) and a parliamentary speech.</p>\n<p>The assignment is due on Tuesday 16 September (Week 8) at 2pm. </p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
