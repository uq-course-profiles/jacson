NOTE: Word count is not limited, this task is a reflection activity and needs to cover what it needs to cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation </strong>– typed, with a cover page.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>In this task you will need to provide your own personal reflections on each enterprise you attend, during the 6 day industry tour (Stream 2) of the compulsory field work. You are expected to attend all sessions and write a reflection for each. If students miss an enterprise reflection, they will be awarded 0 marks for that specific reflection. Please note, these activities are not repeatable, there will be no alternative assessment for these enterprises.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflection Structure</strong></p>\n<p>For each of the enterprises visited, consider the following questions:</p>\n<p>1.      Enterprise description: Name, Location, Production enterprise description (i.e. what does this enterprise do?).</p>\n<p>2.      Does the enterprise have sustainability goals? If yes, what are they? If no, do opportunities exist?</p>\n<p>3.      What did you learn at this enterprise that you didn’t know before visiting? What was it?</p>\n<p>4.      Was there anything unexpected that you learned at this enterprise?</p>\n<p>5.      Would you recommend this location to friends/colleagues/peers to visit? Why? </p>\n<p><strong>General Formatting and Communication</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Task Size – 200-300 words per reflection (excluding references, if used)</em></strong></p>\n<p>What this means is that you are to address the five (5) questions above, where question one (1) does not count towards the word count. This means that your reflection across the whole semester will be about 2000 – 3000 words in total.</p>\n<p><strong><em>General Formatting</em></strong></p>\n<p>Your report must be typed, 1.5 to 2.0 line spacings are ok, font size 12, in Australian (British) English and neatly presented. Communicating your thoughts in a concise and grammatically correct manner is essential to any written document, here at The University of Queensland or outside this institution. One way to check is to read your assignment aloud to yourself, if it is awkward to speak then it is awkward to read. </p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence </strong></p>\n<p>This task is designed to be reflective of your personal experiences with our industry partners. It is envisaged that the use of AI will not be required.</p>\n<p>However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The use of AI or MT must be acknowledged appropriately.
