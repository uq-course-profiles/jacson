How does visual language critique, protest or heal in response to systems. Reflect on the power dynamics of the (in)visible, heard or archived.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3.       <strong>Discuss ways Indigenous art function as a sovereign archive of knowledge that resists, defines, interprets and transmits Indigenous cultures art histories – outside a museum or colonial frameworks.</strong></p>\n<p>Focus on how sovereignty is expressed not just through politics, but through visual, spiritual, and ancestral continuities in art. Reflect on the disruptions Indigenous art presents to linear timelines.

You will write an <strong>expanded label text of 50 words for 4 of your 20 selected artworks </strong>explaining how they contribute to the overall narrative of the exhibition.
