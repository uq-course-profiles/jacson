The function of such an exercise is to take students away from the typical problem-question structure, which can result in a very narrow focus, arguing for one outcome, without contemplating the range of alternative perspectives and potentials. Such a task \"asks the student to assume the position of a judge and to decide the case. The student is subsequently assessed not only on their understanding of the law, but also on their ability to use reason to conclude the case in the face of law’s indeterminacy\" (Goold, P. (2022). The Legal Judgment: A Novel Twist on the Classic Law School Problem Question. The Law Teacher, 56(3), pp. 368-383).
