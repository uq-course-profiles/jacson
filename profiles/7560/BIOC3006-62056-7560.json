This practical is designed to provide students with a practical understanding of the workflow and complexities of microbiome analysis and to enable you to critically judge microbiome research that you encounter in other contexts. Students will analyse samples obtained from rodents with different health conditions and varying dietary intake patterns. As a result of these conditions, the composition of the microbiome changes and conclusions may be drawn about the relationship between the microbiome and metabolic health. Students will start with a table containing the abundances of bacteria in the microbiome and an accompanying mapping file that will be analysed with different statistical methods to identify features that are common and/or specific to various metabolic states. You will be guided through this process using a detailed manual.</p>\n<p>ATTENDANCE AT THE FIRST OF THE TWO COMPUTER PRACTICALS IS COMPULSORY.
