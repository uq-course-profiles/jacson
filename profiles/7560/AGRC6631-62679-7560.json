In the Background section, students need to provide a critical analysis of existing literature relevant to the research topic. They should demonstrate their understanding of the current state of knowledge in the field and identify gaps or areas for further investigation. The Research Objectives section should contain clearly articulated statements of the goals or research questions that the research aims to address.</p>\n<p>Please be mindful of the word limit while describing the research design, methods, and techniques that will be used to collect and analyse data.
