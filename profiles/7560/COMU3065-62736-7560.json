You explain why this observation is interesting as data relating to your chosen theme (see below), and note any questions it raises for you. Your focus is on the observation and questions it raises, which might themselves be answered by further observations. You can relate your observation, briefly, to wider patterns of behaviour, but your aim is not to describe those wider patterns. You may include photographs or recordings. The shared padlet proposes four initial themes for these observations, students can propose an additional theme for consideration. You do not need to post on all the themes. <em>Note: you can post additional observations to the padlet, above 5 in total: simply upload to Turnitin those you wish to be marked. </em></p>\n<p>The main fieldnote padlet contains links to the four thematic padlets, corresponding to the themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural practices (doing things differently)</li>\n<li>Intercultural practices (practices of mediation; negotiation, accommodation, successful or otherwise).</li>\n<li>Embodiment (being there; contact through the senses)</li>\n<li>Linguistic landscapes (language use in the host culture; language use amongst exchange students; language learning)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each entry will be at least 150 words. See the course website for further details of the information to include in each entry.</p>\n<p><strong>How many fieldnotes are required and when should they be posted ? </strong>Five fieldnotes will contribute to your mark, but there are six opportunities to submit, to cater for different starting dates. You submit by the last working day of each month: August, September, October, November, December, January. Remember, nothing stops you submitting a fieldnote early, or submitting a fieldnote when you are no longer in-country as long as it relates to an observation you made during Study Abroad.</p>\n<p><strong>Marking criteria</strong>: Each field note is marked out of 5% on the quality of: Information provided; Comments; Language.

Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.
