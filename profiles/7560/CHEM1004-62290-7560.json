The tutorial class will be structured into two main parts. The first part will be an opportunity for students to check their responses to questions with tutors, interact with peers, and improve their understanding of chemistry. The second part will be an in-class quiz assessment, which will be done individually under 'exam-like' conditions. The assessable content of the in-class quiz will be based on chemistry topics taught in previous lectures (see Blackboard for more information).</p>\n<p>The in-class quiz assessment is a 'closed book' examination with no written materials permitted.
