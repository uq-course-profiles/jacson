This includes a brief explanation of key sources found so far and how they influence your thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, there are marks are allocated for good expression and proper citation. (Marking rubric provided on Blackboard.)</p>\n<p><strong>Format: </strong>There is no single right way to write the research proposal. A template for this proposal, as well as a few examples, will be available on Blackboard. The proposal word limit is 1200 wds (not including footnotes and references). Up to 1300 wds is permissible but after this the marker will stop reading. Please state the word count on the proposal. A significantly under-length proposal will not automatically result in lost marks but is likely to indicate that not all aspects of this assessment task have been completed or done in depth. Headings do not count in the word count (but please don't abuse this), and footnotes do not count in the word count (but please no substantive content in footnotes). No bibliography is expected or required.</p>\n<p><strong>What do I have to do for this research proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment measures your ability to:</p>\n<p>1. apply your learning from the course on a particular topic to develop a specific thesis for a research essay;</p>\n<p>2. to demonstrate your ability to craft a logical and appropriate essay structure; and</p>\n<p>3. to adopt an appropriate research methodology (for finding relevant sources to apply to your argument in the essay (Assessment 2)); and</p>\n<p>4. use appropriate academic writing style (ie. appropriate written expression and adopt relevant legal citation conventions).</p>\n<p><strong>How do I develop a 'specific topic'?</strong></p>\n<p>You are required to pick an area from the general areas for essays listed on Blackboard (under 'Assessment'). These topics are drawn from the first 5 weeks of the course and relate to areas of particular interest and debate in the professional and scholarly literature. They are deliberately drafted in a broad way to set the area of investigation but to allow you to narrow and focus this topic yourself. In class and additional training will be provided on how you develop a good thesis. In short, you want to find an angle that is interesting to you, is associated with a debate in the field or has some uncertainty about it or a gap in existing knowledge, and is also able to be approached with nuance and depth within the word count of the essay (Assessment 2, 2000 wds). You should be thinking about questions like: Why is this an important or interesting angle? What is the law, ethical rules and scholarship saying about the issue? Can I talk about the important issues, represent both sides of a debate and give my view in the words allocated?</p>\n<p>For this marking criterion, we are assessing your clear understanding of learnings in the course on a particular topic, your ability to apply these to a speculative topic, your ability to position your topic in the context of existing knowledge, law or practice as you have identified it in your research to date, your ability to clearly identify the objective and scope of the topic, and your approach to finding further scholarship or professional discussion on the topic. All of this is represented in the marking rubric available on Blackboard. </p>\n<p><strong>What is a logical and appropriate structure?</strong></p>\n<p>While this is fairly self-explanatory, there will be discussion in class about structuring an essay in law and what is expected for the specific essay in this course. For instance, for this course, the essay must have a specific section which is devoted to your personal reflection (see description of the essay). For this assessment item, you are expected to provide a draft structure with suggested section headings. These may well change for your final essay as you develop your argument and understandings of the topic. The marking will reflect the learnings in the course about good essay structure and your proposal's approach to the topic.</p>\n<p><strong>What is an appropriate research methodology?</strong></p>\n<p>Again, training will be provided about undertaking legal research in the course. Please refer to the resources provided on Blackboard.

It is also asking you to apply the learnings in the course about how your personal convictions and experiences influence your approach to professional practice.</p>\n<p>You should apply your learning from the course, as well as your own views and the thoughts of others in scholarly writing and/or case law. You<strong> must</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1. make some reference to, and reflect upon, the relevant law and professional norm associated with the topic; AND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> 2. provide a clear identification of the relevant ethical issue for a legal practitioner/law firm/legal profession; AND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> 3. demonstrate appropriate research undertaken for the subject of your essay; AND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> 4. reflect upon your own personal views on the ethical issue in the context of legal practice and how you might address it.</strong></p>\n<p>You should build on the topic and work undertaken in the first assessment, the research proposal. You are not permitted to change topic for the essay from the proposal (see assessment below) unless you are given express permission. Further explanation of how to build on the work of the proposal will be provided in the workshops and on Blackboard. It is expected that you will conduct further research after your proposal is submitted, and develop your argument on this basis. There are marks associated with identifying appropriate research in the field as well as applying this in the body of our essay. You are permitted to change the structure of the essay from the proposed structure provided in your proposal. The personal reflection section will be developed here, and is not an aspect of the proposal (except to have it as a section heading in the draft structure).</p>\n<p>The essay should reflect your independent and original take on a specified topic, clearly express your own views and apply scholarship/law/knowledge from your research on the topic. It should be more than a description of a particular debate or issue and while describing what others have said in the area is important, you need to build on this with your own thoughts and connections between ideas. Be critical, but accurate, in how you consider the research material found. You must put forward points that support <em>and oppose</em> your views, even where you might provide more words and weight to your own preference. Explain why the other side is not convincing. The essay then must also have a section with a personal reflection.</p>\n<p>The total word count for the research essay must not be more than <strong>2,000 words </strong>(excluding footnotes (which must not contain substantive material)). Words in excess of the limit will not be taken into consideration in awarding a mark. Please state the total word count for your essay on the front page (excluding footnotes). Please provide a bibliography which is not included in the word count. Headings are not included in the word count. There is no minimum word length. However, you should be aware of the possibility that a significantly under-length piece submitted may indicate that the topic has not been covered in sufficient depth or with appropriate sophistication.</p>\n<p>You are welcome to discuss your topic with anyone during or after the course. However, the essay is an individual piece of work. It must be entirely your own work in composition, writing and research undertaken. As usual, anyone else's work referred to must be properly cited. As for any essay, the marker will expect appropriate referencing of sources and communication of information and ideas according to UQ conventions for legal essay writing. (Please refer to the marking criteria below and rubric on Blackboard.)</p>\n<p>There is no minimum or maximum number of cited articles/cases to satisfy the research element. However, to provide some general guidance, it is expected that more than two articles/secondary literature are used in your discussion. No marks are awarded for the number of articles referred to alone. Marks will be allocated for the use of the material found to add to your argument.</p>\n<p><strong>What does 'your own personal views' mean for the essay?</strong></p>\n<p>The personal reflection aspect of your essay means that you must explicitly refer to what you think about an issue, your personal values as they relate to the topic and (where relevant) what you would do in a situation. Essays that simply describe the situation or the law or literature, even expressing a view about the scholarly debate alone, will not be awarded any marks for this category. Refer to the marking rubric provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Your personal views must be either provided in a separate section. The expectation is that the reflection be a genuine attempt to reflect on and discuss the issue and think about how you would act or solve the problem in your work.</p>\n<p>You are welcome to use \"I\" or, if you would prefer not to, you can use another third person way of expressing your views (eg. 'the author').</p>\n<p>If you have a query or concern about the content of your essay, you should speak to the course coordinator well before the due date for the essay.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the <a href=\"https://policies.uq.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=145\">Student Code of Conduct</a>.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
