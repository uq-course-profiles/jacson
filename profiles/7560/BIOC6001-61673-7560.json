However, there are many other well-established procedures and protocols that can be used in the lab to achieve a specific goal – a simple search of the website of a molecular biology supplies company will hint at this diversity.</p>\n<p>So, if you are looking to start using one of these protocols in your research how are you going to find out what it does and how it works? If you wanted to convince a funding body to give you the money in establishing the protocol in your lab, how might you explain it to them?</p>\n<p>For this assessment item you must create two pieces of communication about a specific protocol that will be assigned to you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Promotional Flyer</strong> - A written piece, no longer than two pages, that explains to a junior researcher what the protocol achieves, how it works, and when it is appropriate to use it (like the advertising material used by molecular biology supplies companies)</li>\n<li><strong>Video Explainer</strong> - A narrated video, of no more than 2.5 minutes, that explains the protocol to a member of the public, including what it can be used for or what it can generate (like a short piece you may see on a television news program).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The protocol assigned to you will be based on the concepts underlying the common techniques you will learn about in the lectures, practicals, and workshops. You will be expected to research the protocol you have been assigned to fully understand the molecular basis of the protocol, and what it is used for.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
