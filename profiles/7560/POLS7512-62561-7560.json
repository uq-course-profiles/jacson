These interests may be categorised as political, economic, cultural, social, national, or religious.

On one hand, such contexts are sites for enunciating, reshaping and structuring socio-political forces as part of peacebuilding and political ordering. The idea of interests can help to map conflict dynamics and forge possible agreements. On the other hand, the understanding of interests that peacebuilding and conflict resolution intervenors deploy can profoundly influence how socio-political reshaping and structuring occurs, and the form of the resulting peace.</p></p></div></td>",

            "topic_description": "Conceptual Discussions: Interests We consider the idea of 'interests' this week. Interests figure in much thinking and practice in the field of conflict resolution and peacebuilding. Conflict is often defined, for instance, as a clash of interests. These interests may be categorised as political, economic, cultural, social, national, or religious. We unpack this concept through available definitions, the ideas and practices that are often associated with it, the tensions and contestations it generates, and how these tensions and contestations inform the field of peace and conflict resolution A focus on interests can both illuminate and constrain approaches to peacebuilding and conflict resolution in diverse contexts. On one hand, such contexts are sites for enunciating, reshaping and structuring socio-political forces as part of peacebuilding and political ordering. The idea of interests can help to map conflict dynamics and forge possible agreements. On the other hand, the understanding of interests that peacebuilding and conflict resolution intervenors deploy can profoundly influence how socio-political reshaping and structuring occurs, and the form of the resulting peace.",
