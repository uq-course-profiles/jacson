Responses must be handwritten unless there is an accessibility requirement. (You are responsible for bringing your own pen or pencil.) Students are not permitted to access electronic devices of any kind during the writing task, but may consult printed or handwritten notes. There are 10 total tasks. You will receive three marks for each completed response, 1.5 marks for a partial answer, and zero marks for responses that are incorrect or incomplete (whether unsubmitted because of non-attendance, submitted but blank, submitted but not responding to the prompt, illegible, etc.). You will also receive zero marks if you have not followed an instruction to put away your device.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Tasks (Week 2 - 9):</strong></p>\n<p>For 6 weeks, you will be given a specific prompt for each exercise that will refer to content from the reading, screening and lecture. The question may be related to a still image or brief clip presented in tutorial. Feedback will be given informally via peer groups in the tutorial immediately after writing. Tutors will collect the worksheets afterwards to record completion of the assessment task. To check this grade during the semester, please ask your tutor or email the course coordinator.</p>\n<p><strong>Process Notes (Week 10-13)</strong></p>\n<p>In the final 4 tutorials, you will complete a series of writing exercises related to conceptualising your essay. They will be designed to support your learning and assessment planning. Submission of 2/4 of these tasks will be a hurdle requirement to pass the Comparative Analysis Essay assessment. </p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

Your discussion should have a thesis statement, an introduction and conclusion, and be presented in paragraphs. Your work should present an argument about how form and style creates a particular effect in the clip, carefully describing particular aspects of style (e.g.: mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing) AND making a claim about how these aspects function together.

As we are asking you to look at two films, this argument should also be comparative – you should compare the form and style of the two clips. You must demonstrate your understanding of the terms and concepts in the course textbook <em>Film Art</em> by including references to the textbook in your essay. You must also use appropriate research to support your argument, using a minimum of two (2) academic sources outside of the course readings.</p>\n<p>Your referencing and formatting style must adhere to that which is stipulated in the 17th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style, Author-date style.
