You also get rapid feedback, and gain familiarity with the kinds of topics and questions which will appear in the major assessments. The study tasks will be made available following the lecture starting in WEEK 1, and you will have one week to complete them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Each weekly set of study tasks will be available for 7 days prior to the submission deadline and can be attempted multiple times. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Study tasks must be completed to the minimum standard (indicated in each task) in order to get the full 10% credit.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI and MT STATEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
