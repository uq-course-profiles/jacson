Each task is worth 25 marks.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To check whether the inoculation treatment of the 2024 powder with 1.0wt%Ti nanoparticles has fully converted the columnar grains into equiaxed grains in the 3D printed samples and to confirm whether the grains have been refined.</li>\n<li>To clarify which isotope of Al3Ti, D022-Al3Ti or L12-Al3Ti, formed in the 3D printed alloy that was inoculation treated with Ti.</li>\n<li>To investigate the distribution of the Al3Ti particles (within the grains or along the grain boundaries), and to verify whether such Al3Ti particles acted as the nulceant for a-Al (they are acted as heterogenous nucleation sites promoting nucleation and leading to grain refinement and converting from columnar grains to equiaxed grains). Generally, if a particle acts as a nucleant, it should be within the grain (not on grain boundaries) and there is a particular OR between the particle and the grain. Hence, it is necessary to experimentally determine the OR(s) between the Al3Ti and the α-Al matric to achieve this task. It is required to specify how and/OR can be determined.</li>\n<li>To characterize the fracture surfaces of the tensile test samples after the test has been done (samples are broken) to investigate the difference of the fracture (ductile dimples or brittle cleavage fracture) between the 3D printed samples with and without inoculation treatment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>For each specific task, students should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>select the most suitable instruments; (5 marks)</li>\n<li>design/choose the best technique with that chosen instrument; (10 marks)</li>\n<li>clearly justify why this instrument and this technique are used.
