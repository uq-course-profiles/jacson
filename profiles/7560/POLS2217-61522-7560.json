They are an essential component of the course, which is why attendance is mandatory. The tutorials provide an environment in which you will have the opportunity to engage with the core themes of the course and to discuss the various perspectives on these issues. Students are expected to hand in a short (200 word) summary of one of the articles listed in the recommended readings list for the week in question. The recommended reading list can be downloaded from the course's Blackboard site. Students unsure which article to choose may want to consider reading and summarizing the recommended source listed for each tutorial in the Course Instance (under 'learning activities').</p>\n<p>The tutorial sessions are designed to deepen your critical skills of analysis, synthesis and to enhance your understanding of decision-making in highly complex situation. They are an essential component of the course and presence and participation in these sessions is mandatory. The marking criteria are based on the idea of three P's: Presence, Preparation and Participation. More specifically, your tutorial participation mark will be calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>16 points maximum in total can be earned.</p>\n<p>Students can earn:</p>\n<p>8 points for attendance (8 tutorials x 1 point = 8 points).</p>\n<p>4 points maximum for active participation.</p>\n<p>4 points for reading summaries (8 summaries x 0.5 = 4 points).</p>\n<p>Should a student be unable to attend tutorials and/or hand in their reading summaries because of legitimate reasons, the alternative arrangement will apply: i) Students must let their tutor know as soon as possible if this is the case in any specific tutorial, and provide evidence of a legitimate reason; ii) the student will be required to hand in two (2) reading summaries for the tutorial missed, drawing from two readings; iii) these reading summaries must be submitted as soon as possible after the date of the missed tutorial, and certainly before the end of Week 13. Failure to provide this alternative will result in the student losing marks (the maximum mark per tutorial will be 2.5) for the tutorial missed.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
