As a nascent teacher (who will soon be graduating), this means being able to:</p>\n<p>(a)  analyse student assessment data (evidence of student learning)</p>\n<p>(b)  participate in professional dialogue to moderate evidence of student learning, and feedback; and</p>\n<p>(c)  integrate your understanding of student assessment data (evidence of student learning) to inform your classroom teaching practices.</p>\n<p>However, you are not doing this in a vacuum; there is a plethora of professional and research literature on assessment practices and data more broadly; and in relation to school settings, to which you can refer to assist with such work.</p>\n<p><strong>Task</strong></p>\n<p>This assignment will take the form of a practice-based research report, in which you will take a sample of student assessment and provide evidence about how you have:</p>\n<p>(a)  analysed this student’s work sample (assessment data/evidence of student learning);</p>\n<p>(b)  outlined the nature of the feedback that will need to be provided to the student. This is a 2-step process in which you independently identify this feedback, and then engage in a moderation task (with 1 or more colleagues [in Task 2]) to develop a better understanding of the nature of the feedback that should be provided to the student;</p>\n<p>(c)  outline the nature of the learning sequences and lessons you would then need to provide the student to enable them to address their learning needs, as identified in the feedback. </p>\n<p>For each stage of this process, you need to engage with and critically analyse relevant professional and academic literature about assessment data/evidence of student learning, and draw upon professional discussions with your colleagues about how to provide relevant assessment feedback to students. You will also need to draw upon relevant literature relating to moderation of assessment, and how these practices of analysing students’ work and moderating feedback can inform curriculum development (learning sequences and lesson plans).</p>\n<p><strong>Use the following subheadings in your final report (or develop your own in light of the nature of the task):</strong></p>\n<p><em>1.   Analysing the student work sample </em></p>\n<p><em>2.   Valuing and validating student moderation</em></p>\n<p>3.   <em>Developing learning sequences and lessons</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Section 1 should also include reflections upon the nature of the student sample as a form of data in relation to other forms of data (including large scale standardized data), and literature on these varied forms of data.</li>\n<li>Section 2 is more explicitly focused upon the nature and value of moderation processes, so draw upon your understandings of moderation in all its forms from across the course, including moderation of student assessment tasks [Task 1], but particularly moderation of student samples of work [Task 2].</li>\n<li>In many ways, Section 3 serves as a synthesizing activity for Sections 1 and 2. The best reports will also incorporate relevant literature relating to curriculum development practices informed by a multifaceted conception of data use.</li>\n<li>Use APA style referencing.
