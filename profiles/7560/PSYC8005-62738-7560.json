The dissertation should be of sufficient depth and scope to reflect the research skills that are described by the Australian Qualification Framework as being necessary for a program at a Level 10 Doctoral Degree.  The dissertation can take the form of a traditional research-only thesis, or it can be in the form of a substantial paper or series of papers (ready for submission or submitted), with a general Introduction and a unifying Discussion.  The form of the dissertation should be discussed and agreed with the supervisor.</p>\n<p>\nThe usual minimum length of the dissertation is 30,000 words and the maximum length should not exceed 50,000 words, excluding Tables, Figures, References, and Appendices. The writing must conform to the most current American Psychological Association style requirements (for reference please refer to the Doctor of Philosophy Handbook, section on preparation and presentation of a PhD thesis).</p>\n<p>The dissertation will be submitted when enrolled in PSYC8005/PSYC8010 Dissertation and is the formal assessment of 6 semesters of enrolment in the dissertation courses and should demonstrate the reporting of a substantial piece of original research that has been conducted by the student for the prescribed period under proper academic supervision in a research environment. By the end of the Doctor of Psychology Dissertation courses, the student should be capable of independently conceiving, designing, carrying out and reporting a major research project.</p>\n<p>Further information on the Dissertation courses including dissertation preparation and submission requirements can be found on the Blackboard Community [Doctor of Psychology Dissertation] website.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
