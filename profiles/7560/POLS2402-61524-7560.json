Liberals have since the eighteenth century exalted the benefits of 'free trade', based on the principle of 'comparative advantage', while mercantilists sought to harness trade instrumentally towards national development. But are these perspectives still relevant in a globalised economy? One of the most distinctive aspects of economic globalisation since the late 1970s has been the emergence and spread of complex cross-border 'global value chains', whereby different aspects and stages of the production of goods, and even some services, happen in multiple countries and jurisdictions. The majority of international trade today is not in complete goods and services sold on the open market, but within value chains, dominated by multinational corporations (MNCs). The iconic iPhone, for example, is assembled in China, and is hence labelled 'made in China'. In reality, however, workers in China only put together components made in several other countries, based on technologies developed in various locations, all under the watchful eye of Apple Inc., which directs and reaps the greatest value from this process. Now, however, economic nationalists are challenging the benefits of trade liberalisation and the international institutions that uphold it, like the World Trade Organisation. Tariffs are again rising globally, while governments are screening foreign investment to avoid undue foreign influence and interference. Powerful states are also seeking to weaponise global value chains, for example of key products like semiconductors, for geopolitical gain. In this week, we will critically interrogate liberal arguments in favour of economic liberalisation, and examine the implications of earlier processes of globalisation. We will also examine current trends away from globalised trade and production, and their implications. </p></p><p><strong>Learning outcomes:</strong> L01, L02, L03</p></div></td>",

One of the most distinctive aspects of economic globalisation since the late 1970s has been the emergence and spread of complex cross-border 'global value chains', whereby different aspects and stages of the production of goods, and even some services, happen in multiple countries and jurisdictions. The majority of international trade today is not in complete goods and services sold on the open market, but within value chains, dominated by multinational corporations (MNCs). The iconic iPhone, for example, is assembled in China, and is hence labelled 'made in China'. In reality, however, workers in China only put together components made in several other countries, based on technologies developed in various locations, all under the watchful eye of Apple Inc., which directs and reaps the greatest value from this process. Now, however, economic nationalists are challenging the benefits of trade liberalisation and the international institutions that uphold it, like the World Trade Organisation. Tariffs are again rising globally, while governments are screening foreign investment to avoid undue foreign influence and interference. Powerful states are also seeking to weaponise global value chains, for example of key products like semiconductors, for geopolitical gain. In this week, we will critically interrogate liberal arguments in favour of economic liberalisation, and examine the implications of earlier processes of globalisation. We will also examine current trends away from globalised trade and production, and their implications.",

As economic activities increasingly transcended national borders and as financial markets were liberalised, it became increasingly possible to develop sophisticated accounting practices to reduce taxation in high-taxing jurisdictions, shifting income earned in high-taxing jurisdictions to low-taxing jurisdictions or even to secretive 'tax havens' to avoid paying tax altogether. Although offshore tax havens are often imagined to be exotic islands, populated by seedy Hawaiian-shirt-wearing, disgraced former bankers with a bad tan, in reality significant parts of major financial centres like New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore, operate as offshore tax havens for residents of other countries, while island tax havens, like the Cayman Islands, are in reality an extension of major financial centres too. In short, the 'offshore' is an integral part of globalisation as we know it. Although causing international tensions since at least the 1990s, the 2008 global financial crisis pushed international taxation issues into the headlines. Since, many politicians have proclaimed 'unfair tax competition' over, only to see it survive and thrive. For some, tax competition is positive, pushing down taxation rates in developed countries and hence promoting investment and economic activity. For others, it is another way in which the rich and powerful avoid paying their 'fair share', causing austerity and the decline of public services. In this seminar we will examine the politics of international taxation and interrogate some of the claims made by proponents and detractors.
