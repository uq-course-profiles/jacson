Length: There is no word limit for the worksheet. </p>\n<p><strong>Part Two</strong> involves creating a 3-minute video which draws upon the online and face-to-face content from Modules 2 and 3 of the IPCP curriculum focusing on interprofessional communication, team functioning and client-centred care.  </p>\n<p>Length: Video 3 minutes  </p>\n<p><strong>Part Three</strong> involves a written assignment (300 words max) which draws on the online and face-to-face content from Modules 2 and 3 of the IPCP curriculum focusing on how client-centred care can be improved. </p>\n<p> Length: The word limit for the written assignment is 300 words combined, including in-text references </p>\n<p>Teams will need to submit all three parts of your assessment in the Assessment tab on the IPCP Learn.UQ course site.
