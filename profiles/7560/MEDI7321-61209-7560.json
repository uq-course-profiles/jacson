The nature of these activities will vary according to the placement, but may include admitting/clerking patients, assessing patients at outpatient clinics, presenting at ward rounds and demonstrating initiative in attending other activities such as grand rounds. </p>\n<p>Scoring in the Clinical Participation Assessment (CPA) is based on conduct and contribution during ward rounds and case discussions, initiative in seeking learning opportunities, behaviour towards peers and medical (and all other) colleagues, patient assessment, ability to succinctly present a patient case including differential diagnosis, and awareness of social and ethical issues including risk assessment. </p>\n<p>The CPA components are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clinical Communication </li>\n<li>History Taking </li>\n<li>Examination Skills </li>\n<li>Clinical Reasoning </li>\n<li>Engagement in Practice </li>\n<li>Professional Practice </li>\n<li>Reflective Practice </li>\n<li>Social/Cultural Competence and Safety </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also a Student Flag component which allows a supervisor to report a student with concerning unprofessional or unsafe behaviour. The Student Flag component also provides a mechanism for notifying exemplary performance to the School. </p>\n<p>To maximise your learning, you are encouraged to actively seek feedback from your clinical teacher/s during your clinical placement. This will assist in identifying any areas requiring further improvement before your final Clinical Participation Assessment is completed. Active engagement in the clinical setting is a requirement to pass this assessment task. </p>\n<p>The CPA rubric can be found in the Blackboard Course Site for guidance so that you are familiar with marking criteria for each component. </p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking:</strong> </p>\n<p>The CPA is a global assessment of professional and clinical practice and contribute to your overall performance in the following ways: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you are enrolled concurrently in the WLP course, four components contribute to this MEDI7321 course (Clinical Communication, History Taking, Examination Skills, Clinical Reasoning) and the remaining components (Engagement in Practice, Professional Practice, Reflective Practice, Social/Cultural Competence and Safety and Student Flag) contribute to the WLP course. </li>\n<li>If you are not enrolled concurrently in the WLP course all components contribute to this MEDI7321 course. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additional information may be received by staff from clinical placement site/s where you completed this course. This will be reviewed by the Course Coordinator and ratings completed by your supervisor in the CPA may be revised. For example, if your supervisor rated you as satisfactory related to professional conduct but the Medical School has other information available, the supervisor’s ratings may be moderated based on this additional information. </p>\n<p>Your performance will also be reviewed at the End of Semester Examiner’s meeting and following discussion you may receive a non-graded fail for the course, if: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are any unsatisfactory results recorded in any of the CPA components contributing to this course (including moderations made by the Course Coordinator) </li>\n<li>There are four or more borderline results recorded in any of the CPA components contributing to this course (including moderations made by the Course Coordinator) </li>\n<li>The required number of CPAs have not been submitted to your supervisor for completion by the due date. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Factors that will be taken into account during the review undertaken at the End of Semester Examiner’s meeting include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence of temporal improvement in performance across the course (if applicable) </li>\n<li>Completion and content of the WLP Task Review in response to unsatisfactory or borderline ratings </li>\n<li>Relative opportunity available across the semester </li>\n<li>Other factors relevant to your performance </li>\n</ul>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
