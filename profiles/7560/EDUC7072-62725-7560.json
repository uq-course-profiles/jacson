Your posts can be very brief, i.e. ~100 words. The main areas to focus on in your reflections are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the key take away message you have from the workshop this week?</li>\n<li>What is one talking point from the workshop you are still unsure about?</li>\n<li>What information from the workshop would you like to know more about?</li>\n<li>Highlight any connections to the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST), Science of Learning, High Impact Teaching Strategies (HITS) and your experience of the Micro Teaching Session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are suggested questions only, you are free to reflect on any element of the course you wish. It is important that you post your reflections weekly as they will guide some of the class discussion during the workshops each week. It will also be very difficult to complete the final submission at the end of semester without having made posts weekly.</p>\n<p><strong>Part B -</strong> Final submission - summative feedback given through Turn It In on the due date - this is marked towards the final grade.</p>\n<p>For your final submission, please cut and paste your six most significant reflections from those you have made each week into a word processing document (e.g. Microsoft Word). As a seventh and final section, please add either an introduction or conclusions reflecting on the semester as a whole (~200 words). The focus for this last reflection should be on what you feel you have learned through completing EDUC7072.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
