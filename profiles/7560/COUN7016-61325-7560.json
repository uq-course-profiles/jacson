Given the importance of these areas to professional practice, the tutorial sessions for these weeks will focus on in depth exploration of particular counselling scenarios where these dilemmas are apparent.</p>\n<p>This assessment item assesses your engagement with these sessions in a number of ways. In particular, this task requires you to complete the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the first tutorial of the semester (Week 2), you are to form a group of no more than 3-4 students and to choose one of five scenarios that involve an ethical dilemma (see below).</li>\n<li>The group will then prepare a presentation of no more than 30 minutes, which will include two parts. The first part requires the group to present the scenario, describe a chosen ethical decision-making model that they will use, and then discuss what they did at each step to arrive at their final decision. The second part of the presentation requires the group to facilitate a brief class discussion on the topic, to engage the group and get their input on the topic. As a group member you must be involved in the presentation at some point.</li>\n<li>Attend and participate in the remaining tutorials regarding common ethical scenarios in counselling (Weeks 8-12).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Presentations will occur in tutorials between Weeks 8-12, in the following order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario 1 (Competence): Week 8 </li>\n<li>Scenario 2 (Diversity): Week 9</li>\n<li>Scenario 3 (Boundaries): Week 10</li>\n<li>Scenario 4 (Confidentiality): Week 11 </li>\n<li>Scenario 5 (Autonomy): Week 12 </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Expectations regarding group participation and contribution:</em> It is a common practice for counsellors to consult and collaborate when faced with an ethical dilemma. Therefore, the group work in this task is training you to contribute to such processes. Therefore, the expectation is that you make an active contribution that is discernible to the other members of the group. The process of preparation for your presentation involves a number of tasks, including (but not limited to): finding an ethical decision-making model; working through the varied steps of the model (e.g. identifying stakeholders; researching codes and legislation; generating pros and cons for options; etc.); contributing to group discussion; preparing the various aspects of the presentation; and delivering various parts of the presentation. Therefore, there are many tasks that individual group members can take responsibility for and point to as their active contribution. It is expected that the tasks will be distributed equitably between group members, creating an equitable workload. You then record these contributions on the ‘Member Contributions and Declaration Form’.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
