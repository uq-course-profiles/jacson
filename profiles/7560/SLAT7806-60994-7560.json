Unlike the core tutorial reading for the week, your presentation chapter will be a different one—chosen to <strong>broaden the focus of the course and expose students to a wider range of methods and issues</strong> in applied linguistics research. This task is designed to deepen your engagement with course content, enhance your academic communication skills, and foster collaborative learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Topic and Scheduling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each group will present on a <strong>specific chapter</strong> that complements the weekly tutorial topic but is <strong>not the same as the chapter used in the tutorial</strong>.</li>\n<li>A sign-up Padlet with available presentation chapters will be shared in <strong>WEEK 2 and 3</strong>.</li>\n<li>Groups will sign up to present in one tutorial session between <strong>WEEK 4 and WEEK 12</strong>.</li>\n<li>Presentations begin in <strong>WEEK 4</strong> and continue through <strong>WEEK 12</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Presentation Format</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each presentation must run for <strong>30 minutes</strong> and should include:</li>\n<li><strong>~20–25 minutes</strong> summarising the key ideas, methods, and insights from the assigned chapter.</li>\n<li><strong>One in-class task or activity</strong> (~5–10 minutes) designed to actively engage your peers with the chapter’s content.</li>\n<li>Presentations will be delivered <strong>in class and recorded</strong> for moderation.</li>\n<li>You may choose any appropriate presentation format (e.g., lecture-style, interactive, multimedia), but <strong>visual aids</strong> (slides, handouts, etc.) are strongly encouraged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Submission Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All groups must submit a <strong>single PDF</strong> <strong>via Turnitin at least 2 hours before the scheduled presentation</strong>.
