Find a speaker of English from your personal network (friends and friends-of-friends) and obtain their consent to participate in your project. Ensure that they are not participating in other recordings, and ensure they are not students of this course (present or past). </p>\n<p><em>NOTE: Some students do not have ready access to a speaker of English in their network and time will be given in class for students to help students find an interviewee.</em></p>\n<p>2. Conduct an audio recorded, <strong>15-20 minute interview </strong>with your participant to elicit their natural production of 'yeah-no' in conversational speech. Record the interview with an audio recording device (smart phone, microphone, laptop, etc.).</p>\n<p>3. Administer a series of short questionnaires to your participant, investigating their implicit and explicit attitudes to the use of 'yeah-no' as well as recording their background information.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to submit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data (audio recording of the interview and spreadsheet of data in the format discussed in class)</li>\n<li>A copy of the participant's signed consent form</li>\n<li>Completed questionnaires</li>\n<li>A brief field report with description of the data and source, some interpretation and reflection on your experience using this sociolinguistic method. For this element - <strong>word limit 500 words, +/- 10%</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each component of the small-scale study (including the necessary forms and questionnaires) has been pre-designed by the course coordinator and will be made available to students via the course Blackboard site.
