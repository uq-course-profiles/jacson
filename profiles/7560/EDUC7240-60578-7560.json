It allows the teacher to consider the content of the teaching and the teaching activities that will be used in instruction. Typically, formative assessment is used before or during learning and teaching. The research paper should firstly define formative assessment, hypothetically plan assessment for a school age student who is having difficulty with reading using a minimum of two formative assessment tools/techniques that you would use to assess the achievement standard (see Australian Curriculum). Finally use research literature to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the selected formative assessment tools/techniques, and why teachers should use these strategies/techniques to support learning for students with reading difficulties.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
