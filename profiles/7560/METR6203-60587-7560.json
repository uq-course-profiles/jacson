These concepts are subsequently put into practice through the Control Systems Implementation Projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Based Assignment 1 (LO 1)</strong> will require you to develop a Matlab/Simulink model of a system and conducting simulations to analyse the system's response to various inputs.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Based Assignment 2 (LO 1) </strong>will require you to utilise Matlab for generating and analysing a phase portrait of a given system. Additionally, you will be tasked with determining a Lyapunov function for the system and using it to perform a qualitative analysis of system stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Based Assignment 3 (LO 2) </strong>involves the following tasks: (i) Creating a Simulink model of a balance system. (ii) Computing a linearization of the system and comparing it with numerical functions available in MATLAB. (iii) Designing a stabilizing control law for the linearized systems using state feedback. (iv) Developing a simulation that applies the designed stabilizing control law to demonstrate its local asymptotic stabilization of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Based Assignment 4 (LO 2, 3)</strong> aims to enhance your proficiency in utilizing the MATLAB Control Systems Toolbox, specifically in constructing state observers and state feedback controllers using the toolbox's available methods. The assignment emphasizes the application of state feedback for system stabilization and provides an opportunity to explore the balance between observer poles and feedback poles.</p>\n<p>To access the detailed instructions and assessment criteria for each assignment, please refer to the assignment description provided on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><em>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</em></p>\n<p><em>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<p><em>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
