Each week from Seminar 2 students will be assigned 1 core reading on which to become an expert. At the start of each class, students will work together for 15 minutes to do two tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the main argument of the reading</li>\n<li>Answer the questions provided in class in your pair/small group</li>\n<li>Come up with one question each to ask during the seminar regarding that reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of the critical reading task is to prompt students to deeply reflect on one of the required readings in advance of the seminar. <em>If you do not read your reading before class, you will not be able to participate effectively</em>.</p>\n<p>The in-class critical reading reflection will be due commencing seminar 2 and concluding in seminar 12. You will receive 1.5 points per task (for 15 points total). This means that there are 11 opportunities to do the task, but that you only need to do 10 to achieve full marks. In other words, you can miss one reflection tasks without penalty.</p>\n<p>You will receive the following points per reading reflection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.75 for identifying the main argument of the reading and preparing your questions</li>\n<li>0.75 for answering questions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment will occur orally in class by teaching staff, either in small groups or in the main seminar group. Note that you will receive these points by completing the task alone; there are no 'wrong answers' but you will not receive the points if you do not or cannot provide any answers in class, or if your preparation is insufficient to provide detailed answers.</p>\n<p>This task <strong>requires in person attendance and engagement with the material. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are no extensions for this task. If you have genuine, documented reasons that cause you to miss more than one class, contact Dr Shield and she will provide you with an alternate assessment for that week. However, as this is a postgraduate seminar that relies on participation and is offered in internal mode the expectation is that you will attend class regularly and that one class of flexibility in attendance is ample. </strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.

Research essay questions will be provided on Blackboard in the first two weeks of semester.</li>\n<li>to help you identify effective source material for your research essay and receive feedback on the suitability of that material. Good source material leads to effective writing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All students must submit a 1500 word INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH and ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. You have 1500 words total for this task and can roughly divide that between your introduction and the annotated bibliography. I would suggest 250 words for the introduction and the remainder for the annotated bibliography. We will discuss how to write a short and efficient introduction in class.</p>\n<p>The task has two components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introductory paragraph (250 words - MAXIMUM Of 350 words). </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a draft of the introduction you will write for your research essay. It should contain a clearly stated argument and a road map that indicates the steps that argument will take. The Introductory Paragraph will be evaluated on: the quality of the proposed argument; the suitability of the proposed sections of the essay; the clarity of the overall writing and expression. Points will be deducted if the introduction is longer than 350 words.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Annotated bibliography </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will begin researching your essay and identify 5 sources that will hep you in writing your essay. You will have approximately 250 words to analyse each source. The annotated bibliography SHOULD NOT be a summary of the source you have identified. Rather, it should consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It should assess the quality of the source: is it reputable? How can you tell it is reputable? Why is it effective?</li>\n<li>Why is this source useful for your argument in your essay? (Note that this requires you to have an argument, presented in the introduction!)</li>\n<li>What are the source's strengths and weaknesses?</li>\n<li>Consider each source in relation to each other: how do they complement each other?</li>\n<li>Do your sources form two (or more) sides of a debate? If so, both sides of the debate should be included and you should indicate which you find most persuasive.</li>\n<li>Your sources should cover the range of literature you will need to write an effective essay: ie, theoretical literature where appropriate; empirical literature relating to the question. (We will discuss this component in class and more information will be provided on blackboard).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

As with Islamicate empires, the Sinic order that was manifest in these empires had a profound influence on international order in what we now describe as the Asia-Pacific region. China of course remains one of the most powerful forces in the international system today.
