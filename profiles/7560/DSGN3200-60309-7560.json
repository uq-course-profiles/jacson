This assessment focuses on assessing your capability to translate conceptual ideas into a tangible and well-executed design project, showcasing your mastery of design methods, creativity in problem-solving, and effective communication of design ideas. This assessment task consists of 4 components:</p>\n<p>1) Poster - The poster should visually communicate your design solution, utilising appropriate graphic design principles to effectively present key aspects of your design project. It should highlight the key design features, creating a compelling visual narrative. The poster should demonstrate your ability to effectively communicate the design intent, user experience and considerations.</p>\n<p>2) Prototype - The prototype should be presented during the final presentation to highlight the functional aspects of your final developed design. You are free to choose any appropriate techniques. These might include creating scale models, physical mock-ups, digital interfaces, simulations, etc. You are invited to use the school fabrication facilities if required, as long as the requisite inductions are completed.</p>\n<p>3) Process Documentation - The Process Documentation component requires you to demonstrate a systematic and iterative approach to design. This component should effectively communicate your design solution, incorporating supporting visuals, diagrams, or prototypes as applicable. It should provide a comprehensive overview of your design, including key design principles, rationale, and detailed explanations of design elements. The Process Documentation should demonstrate your ability to synthesize research, apply relevant design theories and methodologies, and present a clear and cohesive design narrative. It should showcase your attention to detail, aesthetic considerations, functionality, and how your design solution addresses the identified problem or need.</p>\n<p>The Process Documentation should showcase the evolution of your ideas and the refinement of your design solutions through application of research and analysis. You are expected to present a clear and organised overview of your design process, highlighting key milestones, design decisions, case studies, references, data collection and analysis methods, and iterations. It should provide insights into your critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and the application of design methods throughout the development of your design solution.</p>\n<p>4) Presentation - The Presentation component requires you to deliver a professional presentation that effectively communicates your design solution, development process, and the rationale behind your design decisions. The presentation should be well-structured, engaging, and articulate. You should demonstrate your ability to confidently articulate your design choices, respond to questions, and provide a comprehensive overview of your design solution. The presentation should effectively communicate the design narrative, user experience considerations, innovative aspects, and the impact of your design solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex/Authentic assessment using AI and/or MT to support learning:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
