The outcomes of the group work are not assessed but each student is required to submit a record of their individual contribution to the group research.</li>\n<li>Present drawings and/or models demonstrating a strategy for the planning of the building including: matching potential uses to spaces and planning of any new volumes required; address and service to the site; vertical circulation and mechanical services for the building.</li>\n<li>Present a visionary image of a major space or spaces in the building showing in three-dimensions the relation of historical and new fabric and uses.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above three items are required to demonstrate an understanding of the full body of research produced by the whole class.</p>\n<p>Formative verbal feedback will be provided during the presentations, with summative written feedback following.
