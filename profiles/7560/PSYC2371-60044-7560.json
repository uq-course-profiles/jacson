Research shows that frequent testing promotes better long-term retention than studying alone (Roediger et al., 2011), so you’ll have regular opportunities to recall and apply key concepts.</p>\n<p>There are 12 quizzes in total, each worth 5%. Only your top 10 scores will be counted, making up 50% of your overall grade. You can expect to see your quiz results on Blackboard within a week or two; if you have any questions or concerns about your marks, feel free to contact the tutors.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>No AI Allowed</strong></p>\n<p>These quizzes measure your understanding of the material without assistance from artificial intelligence.
