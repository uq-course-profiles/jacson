These questions or themes will be weaved through the interactive Modules, Lectorials, Tutorials and Readings. The Portfolio gives students the personal space to dive deep into their own reflexive processes using decolonising lens.</p>\n<p>Developing a strong reflexive practice is foundational in being a respectful, culturally sensitive, equitable, and well-informed practitioner, scholar and Ally. Reflexivity is vital to understanding how cultural paradigms and our own experiences influence our worldviews, unconscious biases, and philosophy in healthcare and research. This Portfolio involves three discrete video logs (VLogs). You are asked to complete a Digital Module (each extends on lectorials, reading materials &amp; tutorial content) for each submission in the Portfolio. The Modules will provide you the space to reflect on, in and for culturally safe practice and engage with broader social and political issues impacting health outcomes.

            "topic_description": "Week 7: Racism as a Structural Determinant of Health This session critically examines racism as a structural determinant of health, with a focus on its impact on First Nations Peoples in Australia and Indigenous communities globally. Students will explore how racism operates across systems—including healthcare, education, housing, and justice—to produce and sustain health inequities. The session will unpack the difference between interpersonal, institutional, and systemic racism and how these intersect with other social determinants. Students will also engage with frameworks that support anti-racist and decolonising approaches in public health practice. By the end of the session, students will be able to identify how racism shapes health outcomes, reflect on their own positionality, and consider strategies for promoting equity and accountability within health systems.
