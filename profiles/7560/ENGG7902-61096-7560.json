Please think carefully about this and draw on your learnings during the ENGG7902 curriculum.</em></p>\n<p>Packaged in a total of no more than 20 PowerPoint slides in total, this pitch will achieve the following things:</p>\n<p>(1) In <strong>strictly</strong> <strong>8 minutes and no more than the first 10 slides</strong>, your team will pitch its final, polished business model in its full glory (company or project name, brand, logo, tagline, sustainable value proposition, viable business model with huge energy and excitement). <strong>Every person on your team must present at least one of the slides.</strong></p>\n<p>(2) From the \"healthy t-e-n-s-i-o-n\" identified in your team's business model canvas, you will clearly pitch the roadmap forward (Why us? Why now? How Much, and on What, When and How this $$$ should best be deployed?).</p>\n<p>(3) In the <strong>5 minutes</strong> following, you will answer questions from the panel of investors.</p>\n<p>(4) <strong>The final 10 slides</strong> should be used to populate with whatever supporting details and data your team deems important (e.g. deeper market analysis, competitors, in-depth summary of customer discovery process, SWOT or risk analysis, more details on key partnerships needed to progress your idea, grants leveraged, full financials etc.)</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI and MT (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Translation)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

It also provides valuable feedback to the course coordinator and ENGG7902 Teaching Team. You will be asked to reflect on your project, perspectives and associated learning with respect to the 3 key course components (Human-Centred Design, Functional Teams and Leadership, and Communicating Value). A series of questions will prompt reflections, with a particular emphasis on how things might have changed or developed from early in semester (Weeks 1-5) versus at completion in Week 13. A rubric and some tips and suggested structure for reflective writing will be provided on Blackboard and this will also be discussed in the workshop in Week 12.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This is an informal, conversational video. It is less about the style of the presentation and more about being thoughtful, sincere and genuine about your learning experience.</em></strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Submission and required format:</strong></p>\n<p>Submissions need to be uploaded to Blackboard before <strong>2pm on Monday 10th November</strong>. Students are permitted to re-upload their presentation as many times as they like before the due date and time.</p>\n<p><strong>Video duration. </strong>Minimum 2 minutes duration/ Maximum 3 minutes duration – done in a <strong>single take</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Recording method.</strong> Use a webcam, phone, or computer—must clearly show your face and upper body throughout.</p>\n<p><strong>Background.</strong> Record in a well-lit, quiet environment where you are the only person visible or audible.</p>\n<p><strong>Eye contact.</strong> You must look into the camera for the majority of your response to demonstrate you're not reading or using visual prompts.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Not Recommended:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reading from Notes or Screens. </strong>Avoid reading from paper, a phone, a second screen, or any device during your recording. Excessive eye movement, a reading tone, or unnatural delivery may indicate you are not speaking authentically and could impact your credibility and grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Fully Scripted or Memorised Recitals. </strong>It’s fine to plan your thoughts beforehand, but do not memorise and recite your reflection word-for-word. Your video should sound <em>natural and conversational</em>, not like you're performing a speech.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Strictly Prohibited:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>No Generative AI Tools. </strong>You may <strong>not</strong> use ChatGPT, video avatars, AI voiceovers, or any automated tools to generate your script or video. Any detected use of such tools will result in your submission being disqualified.</p>\n<p><strong>No Editing or Cuts. </strong>Your video must be a <strong>single take</strong> with no jump cuts, splices, filters, or added music/text.</p>\n<p><strong>How We will Check. </strong>Eye movement and unnatural pauses will be reviewed. Random follow-up interviews may be conducted to verify content understanding if necessary. Metadata of your video file may be checked for signs of editing or third-party tool use.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips for Success. </strong>Practice speaking about your reflection a few times beforehand. Use dot points for prep but do <strong>not</strong> bring them into your recording space. Pretend you're explaining your experience to a friend. </p>\n<p><strong>Other tips.</strong> This reflection should be framed using <strong>“the 4Rs” reflective model</strong>, encompassing <strong>Reporting</strong> (what happened?), <strong>Responding</strong> (how did you feel/ what did you think?), <strong>Relating </strong>(what connections did you make?), and <strong>Reasoning</strong> (why does it matter/ consequences?).</p>\n<p><strong>Use of AI and MT (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Translation)</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

            "topic_description": "Workshop Activities You will work in teams of 4-5 students to work through the various structured activities, as they help shape your team's new idea in Sustainable Engineering Innovation. An MS Teams/Miro Board “Living Document” will serve as a repository of both Individual and Group oriented deliverables leading up to the end of Week 9. Please refer to Blackboard for full details, and we will provide guidance each week as to which deliverables need to be populated into which parts of the shared document. This allocated 3 hour Workshop on Thursdays is a critical time for work to be done. Teams that perform well use this time wisely. To extract maximum benefit from these workshops, teams and individuals will also need to complete extra tasks outside contact hours in a timely manner. A critical component of this course is completing lots of interviews (\"Humble Discovery\") so that your team makes excellent, informed decisions along the way.",
