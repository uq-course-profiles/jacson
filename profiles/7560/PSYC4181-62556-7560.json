Each week there is a reflective feedback activity marked out of 4 completed during the tutorial time. The best five activities' marks will be summed to produce a score out of 20.</p>\n<p>The peer-marking activities will see students divided into groups in the tutes of up to five. Individual students are randomly assigned to give feedback on one of the groups presenting (not their own). Each peer-marking activity consists of 1-3 paragraphs (100-250 words) submitted online. The tutor will collate the feedback for each group and distribute anonymously, for their own learning. However, the tutor will also mark each feedback in terms of its comprehensiveness, accuracy, constructiveness, and insight.</p>\n<p>Each online reflection activity consists of 1-3 paragraphs (100-250 words) about any of the lectures of that week or prior, submitted online. These will be graded against the criteria of accurately summarising and reflecting key aspects of the lecture(s), offering insightful and constructive comments, and suggestions for improvement and extension. You do not need to cover a whole lecture (indeed you will not be able to due to word count) – just pull out a theory, study, finding, or construct that caught your attention, describe and define it, analyse it by showing how it relates to the world or your own life, and critique it with a suggestion for improvement.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.
