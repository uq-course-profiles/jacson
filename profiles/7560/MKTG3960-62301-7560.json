As part of a group of 2-3, you will be asked to prepare: (i) <strong>a market research plan</strong> (25%); and (ii) <strong>a group presentation</strong> (10%). You will also be asked to submit <strong>a peer assessment (5%)</strong> individually. This assessment mimics a real-world professional context where you work as a market research consultant in a team to prepare a market research plan for an agribusiness client. This is just a market research plan. Therefore, you do <strong>not</strong> need to collect primary data. </p>\n<p><strong>Specific requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only one member of your group needs to make a submission on behalf of the rest of the group members.</li>\n<li>You will have the opportunity to consult on your group work with the teaching staff during the tutorials.</li>\n<li>The teaching staff will consider the input from peer members of each group, which means that students may not receive the same mark for the group assessment. </li>\n<li><strong>Market research plan (25%)</strong> - Your group's market research plan must include the following three parts and an attachment (data collection instrument).</li>\n<li><strong>Part I</strong> of your market research plan should include: (i) the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE) contexts of your planned market research; (ii) Management and market research problems; and (iii) the objectives of the planned market research </li>\n<li><strong>Part II</strong> should cover the research design that helps solve the management problem and the market research objectives identified in Part I. You should include: (i) the details of secondary data; (ii) at least two primary data collection methods (including a reference to the attachment (i.e., a data collection instrument); (iii) relevant data analysis techniques; and (iv) ethical considerations.</li>\n<li><strong>Part III</strong> should discuss the project management aspect of your planned market research. Specifically, your group must include a project timeline and milestones (e.g., using a Gantt chart).</li>\n<li><strong>Data collection instrument</strong>: You must develop and attach a data collection instrument to your market research plan. The instrument can be either a survey questionnaire, a focus group discussion (FGD) guide, or a list of interview questions to collect the required data to deliver your project. You must ensure that your proposed data analysis technique aligns with the information the data collection instrument would obtain. There is no page or word limit for this data collection instrument. However, you must consider the interview length, which has ethical and budget implications for your proposed project. Survey platforms such as Qualtrics are strongly encouraged if your group develops a survey questionnaire. </li>\n<li>You must cite all ideas in your presentation slides that are not your own. Assessment items should use the APA 7th style. Please see the UQ library site and staff for details and assistance: <a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7</a></li>\n<li><strong>Group presentation (10%)</strong>: Each student must present and contribute to each stage of the presentation formation. Regardless of the presentation schedule, you must submit the slides by the due date. Internal students are required to deliver the presentation in person at the Gatton campus. External students are requested to deliver via Zoom during the scheduled learning hours in Week 12.</li>\n<li><strong>Peer assessment (individual) (5%)</strong>: Complete \"the peer evaluation\" form (accessible from the Blackboard site; using the BuddyCheck platform). The peer evaluation will influence the final mark awarded to each team member for the group's market research plan. If the peer assessment result indicates that a team member has not done their fair share of the work, their group market research plan’s mark may be adjusted downward based on peer assessment results. To ensure effective group work, you are advised to discuss the group charter with your group members at the start of the semester.</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence: </strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of the assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. If you use AI tools, you must acknowledge them. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission, independent of AI and MT tools. The use of AI or MT must be referenced appropriately.
