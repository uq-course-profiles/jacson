This assignment serves as the foundations of the ‘promote’’ assignment which follows. For this assignment in a group you will create social media content, based on one theoretical theme from weeks 1-5. By carefully considering your target audience, you will create content for specific users and gain insight into ways of critically understanding social media communication strategy. </p>\n<p><strong>Part A – Planning Strategy (1000 words maximum)</strong> </p>\n<p>Use the provided template to develop a written strategy document that outlines: </p>\n<p><strong>Campaign Name</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Target audience</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is the target audience for this video? </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Strategy</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is your overarching plan? </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you trying to get your target audience to do or think? </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Objectives </strong>  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you hoping to achieve through this video? For example, comments, likes, shares, click-throughs, views etc.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Message</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the message you want your viewers to take away? What do you want them to think about or discuss with friends? What change in behaviour or thinking are you trying to influence?  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tactics</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is your communication and creative tactic to reach and engage this target audience? </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>How will you measure the effectiveness of this video? For example: how many comments or likes or shares etc.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part B – Online Exhibition Video Series </strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>Create three videos (each max 2 minutes)</strong> that work as a cohesive series on your chosen theme that addresses promotional culture. These videos should be optimized for a social media audience and reflect a clear strategic intent which links all three as part of a sequence. </p>\n<p><strong>Submission instructions:</strong> </p>\n<p>You must submit your videos in 2 locations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload 3 x two-minute videos to the COMU3150 Social Media Communication Facebook Group</li>\n<li><strong><em>Upload the same</em></strong> 3 x two-minute videos to the COMU3150 Blackboard site using Echovideo.

This evaluation will help determine your individual participation and group engagement throughout the planning and production of your video series. </p>\n<p><strong>AI Use:</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
