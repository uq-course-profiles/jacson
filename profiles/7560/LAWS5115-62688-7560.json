These exercises are designed to guide your reading and to prepare you for what we are going to do in class. So, it is recommended that you complete the exercise every week. <strong>Five of those exercises will be assessed</strong>. It is up to you to keep track of how many you have handed in for assessment and to double-check with the course coordinator that you have had 5 assessed by the end of semester.</p>\n<p>There are 10 Workshops over the course of the Semester, so you will have <strong>10 opportunities</strong> to hand-in your answers. You only need to <strong>hand in 5</strong> of these weekly exercises, each of which will be graded out of 2 (adding up to a total of 10 marks by the end of the Semester). Those 2 marks will be awarded on the basis of the following <strong>Marking Criteria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete response to the assigned task, adhering to all instructions.</li>\n<li>Evidence of independent and genuine engagement with the task including appropriate pre-reading and research.</li>\n<li>Clear and competent written communication skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This assessment item will only be accepted <strong>in-class and in-person</strong>, and cannot be handed in by someone else.
