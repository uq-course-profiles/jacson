For this assignment, it will be your job to act as book editor to help <strong>update the reproductive biology section</strong> of chapter 5 “Behaviour, Sociality and Life Cycle” of the text by compiling an annotated bibliography of the current literature relevant to this chapter. You should find and <strong>select the 10 most relevant journal articles </strong>to annotate. Website information is not acceptable unless it is part of an online journal article. <strong>NOTE - only focus on the reproductive biology section.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Choose your journal articles carefully </strong>to present the most relevant and up to date information. As part of your editorial role, you will also need to indicate in the text of the book chapter, where you would insert this new information and whether any new figures or tables should be added for clarification. For this later exercise, it would be best to photocopy or “scan in” the relevant pages of the chapter and then by hand or using Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Pro insert the reference. <strong>You will also need to provide any new text for your new information which can also be either handwritten or typed using Adobe Acrobat Pro Software</strong>. The location of the reference in the text can be indicated by [1], where [1] would refer to the number of the reference in your annotated reference list. I have provided on the ANIM3049/7043 blackboard website a PDF entitled “What is an Annotated Bibliography”.<strong> It is vital that you read this document carefully in terms of how the bibliography should be set out</strong>. This document also gives an example of an entry for an annotated bibliography; <strong>follow this example EXACTLY</strong> when submitting your assignment but please ensure that you use the APA system when referencing.</p>\n<p>Also note and include – “<strong>the key</strong>” used in the example given in the PDF document. Please note it is not acceptable to simply include an exact word for word abstract of the journal article you have discovered as your annotation; if you do, this will quickly be detected by the turn-it-in software and treated as plagiarism. A PDF of the book chapter can also be downloaded from the BB website.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT)</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
