For any student that does not submit a revised project, the School will revert to your original project on file (unless an alternative arrangement has been approved by the School).</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria &amp; Marking:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Examination procedure</em></p>\n<p>The research project will be examined by two academia staff who have research expertise in your research project topic. Your supervisor, in liaison with their Discipline Convenor, will assign these examiners. The student should not influence or discuss the names of potential examiners with the supervisor. The examiners may approach the student if they wish to do so. The percentage score and grade ultimately awarded to a research project represents the consensus view of the examiners.</p>\n<p><em>Marking of the project</em></p>\n<p>Examiners will be looking for the following broad attributes in respect of research-based course work writing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An original contribution to knowledge in the field</li>\n<li>A demonstrated knowledge of the literature relevant to the subject and the field or fields to which the subject belongs, and the exercise of critical and analytical judgment of it</li>\n<li>Where applicable, development and execution of a satisfactory research methodology</li>\n<li>Satisfactory quality and coherence of the written expression, and its scholarly presentation and format (including adequate references and bibliography).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marking guides will be provided by the course coordinator and on the Blackboard Course Site.</p>\n<p>In the event a third examiner is required to moderate the research project, the following process applies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the event the variance between the first and second examiner is greater than 10 or across two grade thresholds, a third examiner will be employed for moderation.</li>\n<li>Upon finalisation of the third examiner marks, the final average mark for the research project is taken from the two examiner marks closely aligned (i.e. within 10 marks or same grade threshold).</li>\n<li>In the event the variance between all three examiners is greater than 10 or across multiple grade thresholds, the final average grade for the research project is taken from across all three examiners.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance</em>. <em>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
