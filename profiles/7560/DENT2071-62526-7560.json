For each set of factors, examples have been provided for consideration, but please keep in mind these lists are not exhaustive and not all elements are applicable to each client case. For example, you could replace mental health with “low mood,” “depression,” or “anxiety.”</p>\n<p> • List all the professions identified in the case video under <strong>Healthcare Team Members,1 Identified in the video</strong> replacing the red text. Of those professions, identified in the video, outline who would be involved for each set of factors and add them to the template under<strong> Healthcare disciplines involved.</strong> </p>\n<p>• If you identify any gaps in your client’s care, list the healthcare team members who are <strong>not mentioned in the video</strong> but who should be involved under<strong> Healthcare Team Members 2. Gaps in client’s care </strong>replacing the red text.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 Managing Barriers to Interprofessional Communication and teamworking (Video) (30 marks)</strong> </p>\n<p>Watch Part 2 and Part 3 of your team’s chosen client interview, taking notes on the client outcomes so far, the interactions within the interprofessional team, barriers to communication and what contributed to or detracted from client-centred care. </p>\n<p>In your team, film a video (3 mins) identifying three areas where the interprofessional team in your chosen case functioned poorly and recommend processes that the team should adopt in the ongoing management of this client (Each team member must speak in the video). The video is<strong> 3 minutes</strong> in duration. </p>\n<p><strong>Part 3 Interprofessional teams contributing to client-centred care (20 marks) </strong></p>\n<p>From watching part 2 and part 3 of your chosen client video, describe how client centred care was demonstrated by the team and how it could be improved. <strong>(300 words max)</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
