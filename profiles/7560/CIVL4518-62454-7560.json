Full attendance and participation is expected. Participation through the activities is recorded by your tutor/mentor.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to interact and engage with their team, tutor mentor and other members of the course during workshop sessions. If you are unable to attend any session, contact A/Prof Gattas as soon as is possible.</p>\n<p>In special cases, permission may be granted for students to attend fewer sessions. Such permission will not be granted unless exceptional personal circumstances prevent attendance (e.g. documented medical reason or family emergency).</p>\n<p>Each team will have an allocated tutor/mentor for the semester.</p>\n<p>The team, including all members, will formally meet with their tutor at least once a week, during one of the two weekly workshops. The team will not be advised in advance of their meeting time.</p>\n<p>All members of the team will be required to provide a brief verbal report of progress since the last meeting &amp; outline any issues encountered. The tutor/mentor will review team progress &amp; provide feedback on both team progress and individual contributions. Teams who have not made sufficient progress may be required to meet with their tutor a second time to report on progress.</p>\n<p>The tutor may also request information related to individual project contribution, so engineers are expected to keep their own individual workbook in which they keep their own records of, and notes on, their work. The workbook should contain both design development (calculations and sketches) and project management details (meeting minutes, Gantt charts, etc). The workbook may be reviewed by your tutor/mentor during the semester. These maybe unannounced, so students should always ensure that their workbooks are maintained to a high standard.</p>\n<p>Each tutor will complete a team performance proforma, record individual attendance and contribution and submit to the course coordinator.</p>\n<p>Teams may also be asked to complete specific tasks during workshop sessions to demonstrate and reflect on team and individual participation, e.g. completion of a Team Charter (Week 1) or practice peer assessment (Week 4).</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
