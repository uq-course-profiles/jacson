            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>Every week in the workshop, you’ll take a quiz using traditional bubble sheets and pencils to assess your understanding of the material covered. These weekly quizzes are a crucial part of enhancing your learning and improving retention of the course material. Research indicates that regular testing significantly boosts long-term memory retention compared to merely studying the information (Roediger, Agarwal, McDaniel, McDermott, 2014). These quizzes will challenge you to recall and apply what you’ve learned, helping cement these concepts in your memory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quizzes can only be attempted in-class each week. </li>\n<li>The quizzes will commence no earlier than 14.05 each week. You must be in class during the testing period (that is, the time from which the test commences until when it concludes) to be eligible to take the test. If you arrive late but before the end of the testing period you will be able to complete the test in the time remaining in the testing period (e.g., if the test begins at 14.05 and you arrive at 14.10 then you will have until 14.15 to complete the test).</li>\n<li>To take the quiz you will need to produce a valid UQ student ID card and have a pencil. If you wish, you can bring a paper form dictionary with no annotation. This may be an English or dual language dictionary as required. No additional written, printed, or electronic material will be permitted. For the duration of the test, your mobile phones/smart watch must be turned off or in airplane mode and all other items must be placed on floor under your chair.</li>\n<li>In the absence of extenuating circumstances (such as becoming ill), if you complete the quiz but then subsequently leave the class before the end of the workshop, then your quiz will not be graded. </li>\n<li>There will be 10 questions in each quiz</li>\n<li>From Episode 2 (Week 3) onwards, quizzes will comprise questions relating to the current week’s content and content from up to 2 weeks prior (e.g., the Episode 3 quiz in Week 4 may include questions related to Episode 1 and Episode 2 as well as Episode 3). In each week the majority of the questions will be on content from that week’s episode.</li>\n<li>There will be 8 quizzes.</li>\n<li>Your best 5 marks out of the 8 quizzes will count to your grade.</li>\n<li>Each quiz is worth 10 marks, and the quizzes contribute 40% of your overall percentage.</li>\n<li>You must attempt each quiz on your own.</li>\n<li>You must attempt the quiz for either Episode 7 or Episode 8 of the course in order to be awarded more than a Grade of 4 in the course. An attempt is defined as providing an answer to at least 50% of the multiple choice questions.</li>\n<li>If you are unwell and unable to complete a quiz, you will only need to provide medical documentation in the event that you miss four or more quizzes. If you miss one, two or three quizzes, we will simply count your best five attempts at the other quizzes. If you miss a quiz however, make sure you get the appropriate documentation at the time you miss the quiz however, just in case you end up missing more than three and you need to provide it.</li>\n<li><strong>Important: </strong> You must write your name/student number on your answer sheet for us to be able to give you the marks for this assessment item. If you submit an answer without your name/student number, we will not be able to match it to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your quiz grades will be available on Blackboard a week or two after each quiz.
